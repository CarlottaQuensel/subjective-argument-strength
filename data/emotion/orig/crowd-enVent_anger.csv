Only, he didn't stick to the one side of A4 rule we had. He had pages and pages of really dull, incredibly dreary writing (I feel so bad saying this), and I just couldn't make myself care enough to listen, I just wanted it to be over but it went on forever.

5332	I felt boredom over lockdown quite a lot. Being self-employed and in the arts meant there was next to nothing with regards to work. Eventually I began occupying my time better, but I was incredibly bored for about a week at one point. I knew I was bored because I usually enjoy playing console games when I have free time, but I sat there, scrolling through the list of games without any desire to particularly play any of them. I flirted with the idea of buying new games, but cheap ones, nearly pointless ones, just to fill my time for even a few moments. I’d usually succumb to smoking weed if I got that bored but even weed was boring it me at that point in time. Mentally checking out was all I wanted to do	0

5843	I recently decided to leave my current job in the middle of a pandemic with no backup plan. I resigned from my job as I have depression and anxiety and it was mostly caused by my work. My work is as a civil Servant and I frequently support people with complex needs but I feel that the system is not fit for purpose. I have also had depression and anxiety for a long time so I class it as a disability but my employer has not been good at all and does not view my mental health as a disability and did not give me any reasonable adjustments. I felt a lot of fear when I resigned from my job as I was scared about what I would do financially if my savings run out and scared about the uncertainty of finding new work in the pandemic where there is a threat to my health and safety. I also felt fear about what others would think of me and what my managers reaction would be.	0

She said she was going to throw all my electronics into the bathtub but since my set- dad bought some of them for me, she didn’t. Then told me I needed to move out and I couldn’t move in with my grandparents. (At this time she was transitioning different bipolar medications and she was very unstable, that’s why it might seem crazy she said all that just because I didn’t go to class one time.)	0

They told me to empty my pockets and that they didn't wish to hurt me, so I gave them my wallet and my phone, walked to my friends house and called the police.

5782	I felt fear when my family house burnt down in 2016. Me and my dad were home and we had just returned from an outing. I was upstairs getting dressed and he was downstairs on the computer, and I could hear a popping sound. I thought that it was just the bathroom tap leaking but I still told my dad. He immediately thought it was an electrical issue so he turned off the house electricity from the mains. He stepped out of the house and all we could see was the roof on fire. I stupidly ran back in the house to get my phone and inhalers and he shouted me down, moved the  cars out of the driveway. The whole street was watching whilst the house was on fire, we'd called the fire engines and the police. My mum was called from work and when she turned onto the street she collapsed in shock, my dad was a mess and crying and running about. I was calm but inside I was scared. We were given a hotel from ther insurance company and it wasn't until the next day when we went to see the damage and all of the roof was gone, our bedrooms completely burnt down. I felt fear at that point.	0

My parents didn't tell my brothers and I that we were going to possibly be getting a new dog. I walked downstairs and saw this big, fluffy, black doodle. I honestly don't know if I have ever been more excited. I was literally jumping up and down with joy. The family ended up giving us the dog, Vinny, free of charge, and he has been the best dog ever. He and I are besties and do everything together!	0

We'd finished praying and we were making dua as we usually do for the deceased and in general and I'm guessing my mum and dad had found out about his death earlier that morning and my mums voice just completely cracked and she broke down completely and just kept saying the words ""he's gone, (uncles name) gone"". It took me and my sister a while to process what we'd just been told and me, my mum and dad were in my parents room just crying for hours. I, personally had never really experienced death or grief in my life before, so this was the first time. Seeing my parents, especially my mum cry was excruciating."	0

We got in the car and my cat was still freaking out - my roommate wanted my boyfriend to turn on some music and make it loud. We both told him no because my cat was having trouble with everything going on. Also, she is 17, so she is quite old, so I worry about her stress levels. After we told him no, he then proceeded to sing VERY loudly and when we scowled at him for it, he said ""well she is meowing and stressed either way"", and he did not care that she was having trouble and that I was trying to calm her down.

How do my partner and I spend all our time working and we can’t afford to pay our rent or guiltlessly give our daughter the perfect first birthday, even on a budget.

456	another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do. This was not the first time, in fact it had gone on for about two years and this time was the final straw. It was time for me to stick up for my child and put a stop to it once and for all. My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The anger rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so angry that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so angry that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as anger had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.	1
457	i was being bullied in school	1

5209	Another member of the art co op that I have my art studio in put himself forward for my treasurer role without consulting me until less than a day before. He arranged his friends to vote for him. It was widely acknowledged that I did my role exceptionally well under difficult circumstances (covid and the co op had to relocate/nearly folded during my time). Yet other personalities wanted to have representation on the managing committee based on their friendships, not on the process of the co op. The irony was that I wanted to pass on the role anyway, but doing so in such an abrupt way was irresponsible as well as the obvious deception and disregard for all my hard work. The roles in the co op are all voluntary which makes it even worse that an atmosphere of competition was set up when we could have collaborated and had a nice smooth handover transition period.	1
