7136	I felt pride when I made a new friend at college because I struggled to find somebody trustworthy and ‘’my kind of person”. I’m not very social and I don’t like to talk outside of work so I was filled with pride when I found myself a friend who felt the same way. I was full of pride because I embraced who I really was and I didn’t feel so alone because I knew there were people like me.	0

3398	I felt fear because of my cousin, B. She and I used to be extremely close, pretty much like sisters. (In another situation for the fear survey I talked about two people, A and P, they are also relevant in this story). After my situation with A and P where garbage was thrown at me, they decided to mess with my family. They told B that I was talking bad about her all the time, and said I was spreading rumours, and she tried having me suspended from school. when that didn't work because they know everything she said was wrong, she tried pushing me down the stairs at school. when I dodged her, she waited a few days and slammed me into a locker and two guys had to get her off of me because she was probably about 100 pounds heavier than me. Since then, I have not seen her or gone to any family gatherings because I'm so scared of her doing anything to me. I'm still very scared of her.	0
5858	My mother was dying of cancer	0
220	I get extremely bored at work. If fact that is the reason I signed up for prolific in the first place. I work in an office job and there isn't much work to do in the middle of the week. I try and cure the boredom by doing surveys, or just chatting with my co-workers, or friends on my phone.	0

I found a bank statement in the kitchen and just happened to open it and see all the ins and outgoings. I felt so sad and confronted him when he got home from work. He was very sorry but it still to this day makes me feel upset that we were put in such a horrible position and what the outcome could have been if I had not found out when I did.	0

3321	I was dating a girl during high school and after some date I took her home. Normally I would just drop her off and head home myself, but this time she and her guardian invited me inside to relax before the long drive home. Once inside I discovered that her family were hoarders and rarely, if ever, would clean the house using actual products. The house had a smell to it that would differ between rooms, but it always seemed to be a sweet-and-sour kind of stench. At the time I never said anything aside from offering to clean some stuff, but it was often physically revolting to be inside the house for any extended period of time.	0

649	When my husband's business partner became pregnant because I wanted my husband to be employed by a company instead of him being a director of his company which was failing. I wanted him to apply for a local job which had amazing benefits and amazing pay and it was obvious that their business idea wasn't going to work in the long run. My husband refused to apply saying he was going to let his business partner down. Then a couple months later as the company was slowly losing money his business partner announced she was pregnant, but she was 5 months pregnant so knew for a while! I felt so angry because my husband decided to then find a job and I wish he just listened to me from the beginning.	0

744	I was playing cricket with my siblings and friends. I was fielding, in the outfield. I was waiting for the ball to be hit my way and it didn't come my way for a long time.

This particular time I stood there for ages without the ball coming near me.	0

At the time it was fairly awkward - the person I sat next to looked confused, and occasionally I look back on it and feel embarrassed about the whole thing, and ashamed that I didn't want to sit next to my brother for some reason.	0

I love my boyfriend of two years very much but I still think about my ex a lot because it just felt unresolved (though I'm not entirely sure resolving it would change much). It's mostly because my ex was extremely wealthy and although my current bf and I are well off for our age, it's tough when I consider that I could be flown around in a private jet instead. I feel extremely guilty thinking about this and typing it out because I don't want to sound greedy. I just grew up in the lowest income bracket and I can't help but be enticed by money as it was such a barrier growing up.

456	another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do. This was not the first time, in fact it had gone on for about two years and this time was the final straw. It was time for me to stick up for my child and put a stop to it once and for all. My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The anger rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so angry that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so angry that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as anger had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.	0

3744	Getting an email the other day that I didn't get an interview for a job I applied for. I didn't really feel any particular emotion, I think because I knew I hadn't really tried on that application and didn't really care that much. I just sent an email saying thanks for their time and moved on.	0
51054	I felt guilt when as a young adult I wore braces on my teeth and I hated them, even though it was my choice to get them. I was visiting my younger sister who was working overseas and we had a brilliant time together. She took lots of photos of us, had them developed (it was the 1990s!) and sent them to my family. In one picture in particular, all I could see were these awful braces. I couldn't see anything else - the fabulous place we were in, the gorgeous outfits we were wearing, how lovely our hair was as we'd treated ourselves to getting blowdries, and I wrote her the most horrible letter saying that the only reason she'd sent that photo was to prove how gorgeous she was compared to me, she knew how ugly I was and that I was sorry I'd ever visited her in the first place. To this day I still feel so awful for writing that letter. She could only see the fun time we were having - I was the one with the complex about my teeth.	0

41413	I lost an online video game tournament that I had been trying for several years to win.  Truthfully, my team has always came in 2nd or 3rd for several years, and as one of the top players, I really really wanted to come in 1st place one year because I felt I worked hard for it and I deserved it.  It was the last year the tournament would be running and I got trolled by some guy who didn't like me who was a guild leader of a different team by recruiting a player that was widely agreed to be a lesser tier player and who also didn't like me.  They ended up coming in first place and of course the other guild leader and everyone else who didn't like me trolled the hell out of me and threw it in my face because everyone knew I wanted my team to come in first that year since my team never came in first and it was likely the last year of the tournaments.  I pretty much wanted to smash my monitor with a chair and then set it on fire and then go cry in a corner	0

Each day we woke up and went about our day, not knowing it our holiday would be cut short. This was a stressful time for me as I had always wanted to go to Disney and it was my first ever time and I was going to be gutted if it got cut short. However, we were able to enjoy our holiday and although the park did close, it closed at the end of our very last day there so we were able go travel home as planned, having had our whole holiday and we didn't need to claim anything back on our holiday insurance.	0

4594	I felt fear when a man I had feelings for was not responding to my text messages. I have an iPhone and so I use iMessage with others who also have iPhones. When you use iMessage, the chat bubbles are blue, but I noticed one day that the chat bubbles with him were green. That indicates that the recipient does not have an iPhone, or that they are in an area without internet and therefore are getting the messages sent as text messages rather than iMessage. The problem was that he had not been responding and I started wondering if he was seeing my texts at all - then I had a suspicion he had blocked me this entire time. I messaged a mutual friend to ask if he had told them he was angry with me, and I then checked to see if I could still see his profile on social media platforms. I could not. I started getting anxious at the indication that he had blocked me on everything, and that anxiety skyrocketed with each profile I wasn't seeing. My friend told me she could still access his profiles, and it was then I realized he had blocked me on everything.	0

The teacher asked me to close my eyes, he stood behind me and asked me to fall backwards and trust me to catch him. I did trust him and so I fell back and he caught me. Then as he was still stood behind me speaking he asked me again to close my eyes but this time fall forward. I was confused as I knew he was still talking behind me.
