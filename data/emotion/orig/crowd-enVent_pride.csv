The house had a smell to it that would differ between rooms, but it always seemed to be a sweet-and-sour kind of stench. At the time I never said anything aside from offering to clean some stuff, but it was often physically revolting to be inside the house for any extended period of time.	0

I found some old acid in my dresser drawer and waited for when my parents were away for a while, then tripped balls at 7 in the morning in the freezing cold New England woods.

4941	I felt no particular emotion when I was promoted at work last year because I put very little importance on the job I was doing last year and honestly thought quite poorly of the organisation, and I didn't really care if I was promoted or not as it wouldn't really affect my life.	0

They were in the early stages of their relationship, whilst me and my partner were long past the honeymoon stage. They spent the night whispering sweet nothings to each other and completely ignored us. There was no swinging out the moves on the dance floor like the good old days, we were just stood around like a spare part. I cut the night short as i was so bored the time was dragging! I was home and in my PJs by 10pm and we avoided going out with them again!	0

Every day i went to sit by my grandmother to keep her company and spend as much time with as possible. We were told that she wouldn't last much longer and yet my father and relatives decided drinking would be a better way to pass the time rather than stay with her as long as they could. I spent the night alone with the nurse and my grandmother while they all got drunk to drown their sorrows. I was so disgusted by their behaviour as well as angry. The disgust hasn't really left.	0

And I felt so overwhelmed with sadness. I stared in the mirror, pulling at my skin, I disassociated for a few minutes, felt dizzy when I came round, and collapsed on my bed.

41413	I lost an online video game tournament that I had been trying for several years to win.  Truthfully, my team has always came in 2nd or 3rd for several years, and as one of the top players, I really really wanted to come in 1st place one year because I felt I worked hard for it and I deserved it.  It was the last year the tournament would be running and I got trolled by some guy who didn't like me who was a guild leader of a different team by recruiting a player that was widely agreed to be a lesser tier player and who also didn't like me.  They ended up coming in first place and of course the other guild leader and everyone else who didn't like me trolled the hell out of me and threw it in my face because everyone knew I wanted my team to come in first that year since my team never came in first and it was likely the last year of the tournaments.  I pretty much wanted to smash my monitor with a chair and then set it on fire and then go cry in a corner	0

Only, he didn't stick to the one side of A4 rule we had. He had pages and pages of really dull, incredibly dreary writing (I feel so bad saying this), and I just couldn't make myself care enough to listen, I just wanted it to be over but it went on forever. It was a small group of us, and on zoom we could see each other, so I knew my reactions were visible and I wanted so badly to fidget and just do *something* but couldn't.	0

Those weren't the words they used but it's essentially what they meant.

4976	"My aunt died.  I wasn't super close with her, but outside of immediate family, she was someone that I saw fairly regularly for a large portion of my childhood.  Fairly regularly meaning basically on holidays every year.  She was a great person and I never had anything bad to say about her.  I've had other relatives pass away besides her where I didn't feel anything, but I think she was the first.  It was kind of sudden.  She got cancer and was gone within a couple months or so.  Since it was the first time I had lost anyone remotely close to me, I remember it well specifically because I didn't feel any sadness or anything really.  It was kind of like ""well, that sucks I guess.""  I wasn't (and still aren't) sure if something was/is wrong with me for not feeling something more."	0

3528	I felt guilt whenever I think about how my life could be with another man. I love my boyfriend of two years very much but I still think about my ex a lot because it just felt unresolved (though I'm not entirely sure resolving it would change much). It's mostly because my ex was extremely wealthy and although my current bf and I are well off for our age, it's tough when I consider that I could be flown around in a private jet instead. I feel extremely guilty thinking about this and typing it out because I don't want to sound greedy. I just grew up in the lowest income bracket and I can't help but be enticed by money as it was such a barrier growing up. I'm trying really hard to develop a healthier relationship with it as I grow older.	0

456	another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do. This was not the first time, in fact it had gone on for about two years and this time was the final straw. It was time for me to stick up for my child and put a stop to it once and for all. My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The anger rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so angry that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so angry that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as anger had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.	0

I've never been more disgusted in my life, we had to call her parents and clean it up ourselves because they yelled at us and were no help at all. R's truck stunk for months.	0

So I get a phone call from my mom telling me she had a surprise for me and she pretty much went to the court house and paid all my ticket fees and the relief I felt knowing I wouldn’t have to slave my days away just to give my money back to the governing anyways I know this is long but I admire my mom for that and it was a big relief and weight off my chest !	0

52157	"I felt sadness when it was during Ramadan 2020 during the pandemic. I remember hearing little conversations about my uncle (mothers brother) being ill and I'd always ask of him just to check if he was okay. My family and I had woken up at around 04:00 to pray fajr together. We'd finished praying and we were making dua as we usually do for the deceased and in general and I'm guessing my mum and dad had found out about his death earlier that morning and my mums voice just completely cracked and she broke down completely and just kept saying the words ""he's gone, (uncles name) gone"". It took me and my sister a while to process what we'd just been told and me, my mum and dad were in my parents room just crying for hours. I, personally had never really experienced death or grief in my life before, so this was the first time. Seeing my parents, especially my mum cry was excruciating."	0

I couldn't see anything else - the fabulous place we were in, the gorgeous outfits we were wearing, how lovely our hair was as we'd treated ourselves to getting blowdries, and I wrote her the most horrible letter saying that the only reason she'd sent that photo was to prove how gorgeous she was compared to me, she knew how ugly I was and that I was sorry I'd ever visited her in the first place.

That indicates that the recipient does not have an iPhone, or that they are in an area without internet and therefore are getting the messages sent as text messages rather than iMessage. The problem was that he had not been responding and I started wondering if he was seeing my texts at all - then I had a suspicion he had blocked me this entire time. I messaged a mutual friend to ask if he had told them he was angry with me, and I then checked to see if I could still see his profile on social media platforms. I could not. I started getting anxious at the indication that he had blocked me on everything, and that anxiety skyrocketed with each profile I wasn't seeing. My friend told me she could still access his profiles, and it was then I realized he had blocked me on everything.	0

It took a lot to get other members on the team to buy in but eventually they did. On the night of the game we made £1700 for the team and wider club which helped pay for a lot of different things. Not only that but over the following years the game just got bigger and bigger each year with the game eventually being played in front of 3000 people. It gave me immense pride to have this initial idea for it to grow into a great spectator event, but also a game that the guy who took part in it will remember for the rest of their lives.	1
