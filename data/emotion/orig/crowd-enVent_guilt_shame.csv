3398	I felt fear because of my cousin, B. She and I used to be extremely close, pretty much like sisters. (In another situation for the fear survey I talked about two people, A and P, they are also relevant in this story). After my situation with A and P where garbage was thrown at me, they decided to mess with my family. They told B that I was talking bad about her all the time, and said I was spreading rumours, and she tried having me suspended from school. when that didn't work because they know everything she said was wrong, she tried pushing me down the stairs at school. when I dodged her, she waited a few days and slammed me into a locker and two guys had to get her off of me because she was probably about 100 pounds heavier than me. Since then, I have not seen her or gone to any family gatherings because I'm so scared of her doing anything to me. I'm still very scared of her.	0

Normally I would just drop her off and head home myself, but this time she and her guardian invited me inside to relax before the long drive home. Once inside I discovered that her family were hoarders and rarely, if ever, would clean the house using actual products. The house had a smell to it that would differ between rooms, but it always seemed to be a sweet-and-sour kind of stench. At the time I never said anything aside from offering to clean some stuff, but it was often physically revolting to be inside the house for any extended period of time.	0

I was surprised because no one had ever been that excited about something I was doing, and as an adult I'd never had a stranger ask for my number and want to be my friend so randomly like that.	0
649	When my husband's business partner became pregnant because I wanted my husband to be employed by a company instead of him being a director of his company which was failing. I wanted him to apply for a local job which had amazing benefits and amazing pay and it was obvious that their business idea wasn't going to work in the long run. My husband refused to apply saying he was going to let his business partner down. Then a couple months later as the company was slowly losing money his business partner announced she was pregnant, but she was 5 months pregnant so knew for a while! I felt so angry because my husband decided to then find a job and I wish he just listened to me from the beginning.	0

3315	I applied for a job onetime after applying once before. I had previously found out that I had lost out to a person who already wrorked within the same team in a junior position however i was more qualified. I asked for feedback as to why i did not get the job and I was provided with an answer that told me how to improve in the future. a month later the same job came available I took onboard the advice and spent  days revising, researching  and studying for the interview. again the same thing happened. when I asked for feedback about my answers They told me that I should have answered the questions almost word for word in the way that I did indeed actually answer the question. I was disgusted that people could be treated this was as i had spent so much time working hard to secure this Job and that no matter how i interviewed the job was always destined for somebody internally.	0

6652	I felt pride when I organised, managed and played in an ice hockey varsity game. It had never been done before and the team was in financial trouble and I saw it as a great opportunity to make some money for the club and also to give the team and sport some exposure. It took a lot to get other members on the team to buy in but eventually they did. On the night of the game we made £1700 for the team and wider club which helped pay for a lot of different things. Not only that but over the following years the game just got bigger and bigger each year with the game eventually being played in front of 3000 people. It gave me immense pride to have this initial idea for it to grow into a great spectator event, but also a game that the guy who took part in it will remember for the rest of their lives.	0

744	I was playing cricket with my siblings and friends. I was fielding, in the outfield. I was waiting for the ball to be hit my way and it didn't come my way for a long time. I felt very bored just standing there, waiting for the ball, when it didn't appear and I had nothing to do. I don't like playing cricket that much anyway, and when I play I like batting the most.

This particular time I stood there for ages without the ball coming near me.	0

They ended up coming in first place and of course the other guild leader and everyone else who didn't like me trolled the hell out of me and threw it in my face because everyone knew I wanted my team to come in first that year since my team never came in first and it was likely the last year of the tournaments.

We'd finished praying and we were making dua as we usually do for the deceased and in general and I'm guessing my mum and dad had found out about his death earlier that morning and my mums voice just completely cracked and she broke down completely and just kept saying the words ""he's gone, (uncles name) gone"". It took me and my sister a while to process what we'd just been told and me, my mum and dad were in my parents room just crying for hours.

Due to some circumstances this transition happened sooner than expected. We decided the best thing to do was move to another state to pursue an opportunity. I was really nervous about selling a house during a pandemic, even if the market and interest rates were the best they ever were.

3714	Performing my monologue for class. I was playing a sad situation but I didn't really connect with it myself, maybe because I'd done it so many times, or maybe I just suck at acting. The moments of the monologue kind of passed and then it was suddenly done. I think though because I wasn't really nervous, and I was disconnected from myself, my emotions just weren't relevant at the time. It was just like, I didn't care what was going on, but I don't not care.	0

He had pages and pages of really dull, incredibly dreary writing (I feel so bad saying this), and I just couldn't make myself care enough to listen, I just wanted it to be over but it went on forever. It was a small group of us, and on zoom we could see each other, so I knew my reactions were visible and I wanted so badly to fidget and just do *something* but couldn't.	0

Those weren't the words they used but it's essentially what they meant.

456	another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do. This was not the first time, in fact it had gone on for about two years and this time was the final straw. It was time for me to stick up for my child and put a stop to it once and for all. My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The anger rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so angry that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so angry that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as anger had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.	0

4594	I felt fear when a man I had feelings for was not responding to my text messages. I have an iPhone and so I use iMessage with others who also have iPhones. When you use iMessage, the chat bubbles are blue, but I noticed one day that the chat bubbles with him were green. That indicates that the recipient does not have an iPhone, or that they are in an area without internet and therefore are getting the messages sent as text messages rather than iMessage. The problem was that he had not been responding and I started wondering if he was seeing my texts at all - then I had a suspicion he had blocked me this entire time. I messaged a mutual friend to ask if he had told them he was angry with me, and I then checked to see if I could still see his profile on social media platforms. I could not. I started getting anxious at the indication that he had blocked me on everything, and that anxiety skyrocketed with each profile I wasn't seeing. My friend told me she could still access his profiles, and it was then I realized he had blocked me on everything.	0

283	I was at a small event at a university with my friends and I thought it would be funny to try to steal a few drinks from behind the bar. I got caught and obviously had to return the drinks. I still feel horrible about it as I would never do such a thing now. Even then I felt ashamed.	1

3506	I sexted someone	1
3507	I put very little effort into a fake card which I intended to give as a joke and replace. The recipient was very pleased, and it looked almost exactly like the card my little sister made, and worked very hard on.	1
3508	I felt guilt when I strongly and openly resisted caring for my emotionally abusive mother in an emotionally and physically abusive environment.	1
3509	I said no to hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while when I should have said yes.  I was too lazy to meet them.	1
3510	When I got too drunk at my sisters 21st and messed up the lovely speech I had prepared.	1
3511	I felt guilty when my friend (lets call her L) had gotten a girlfriend and I was talking to my friend N about it at work because we were all friends the previous work season because she was our coworker as well and I completely forgot her brother was at work and he overheard and now she's telling everyone I came out to her whole family for her even though he just accidentally overheard and I've been getting almost harassed for months now.	1

3527	I suspected my girlfriend of 5 years was cheating on me. She left her Facebook logged into my computer when she left, and I checked her messages. She was indeed cheating on me, but the way I found out was... wrong. I should have been better. I regret that to this day.	1
3528	I felt guilt whenever I think about how my life could be with another man. I love my boyfriend of two years very much but I still think about my ex a lot because it just felt unresolved (though I'm not entirely sure resolving it would change much). It's mostly because my ex was extremely wealthy and although my current bf and I are well off for our age, it's tough when I consider that I could be flown around in a private jet instead. I feel extremely guilty thinking about this and typing it out because I don't want to sound greedy. I just grew up in the lowest income bracket and I can't help but be enticed by money as it was such a barrier growing up. I'm trying really hard to develop a healthier relationship with it as I grow older.	1

3495	I felt guilt when I recently convinced a friend to not go on a trip he's been planning for the last few months (biking from Toronto to Vancouver alone, for charity) because I was concerned about his safety. I feel guilty because he started a charity for it and raised quite a bit of money but my talk really discouraged him from doing it, since a solo trip at that length in rural Canada is quite dangerous. Nevertheless, I feel guilty.	1
3497	spent money on myself but not my s/o	1
3498	I did not get to say goodbye to my dying grandmother	1

The very next day my mother told me that that same little boy that I yelled at was hit by a car and died. I have and never will forgive myself for the way I treated that little boy.

My parents live fairly close to me, but I guess I told myself I didn't have the energy or didn't feel like it a lot of the time because I was busy with work or school or other things.

I was visiting my younger sister who was working overseas and we had a brilliant time together. She took lots of photos of us, had them developed (it was the 1990s!) and sent them to my family. In one picture in particular, all I could see were these awful braces. I couldn't see anything else - the fabulous place we were in, the gorgeous outfits we were wearing, how lovely our hair was as we'd treated ourselves to getting blowdries, and I wrote her the most horrible letter saying that the only reason she'd sent that photo was to prove how gorgeous she was compared to me, she knew how ugly I was and that I was sorry I'd ever visited her in the first place. To this day I still feel so awful for writing that letter. She could only see the fun time we were having - I was the one with the complex about my teeth.	1
