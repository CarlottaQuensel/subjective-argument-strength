My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The ... rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so ... that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so ... that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as ... had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.	0

51054	I felt ... when as a young adult I wore braces on my teeth and I hated them, even though it was my choice to get them. I was visiting my younger sister who was working overseas and we had a brilliant time together. She took lots of photos of us, had them developed (it was the 1990s!) and sent them to my family. In one picture in particular, all I could see were these awful braces. I couldn't see anything else - the fabulous place we were in, the gorgeous outfits we were wearing, how lovely our hair was as we'd treated ourselves to getting blowdries, and I wrote her the most horrible letter saying that the only reason she'd sent that photo was to prove how gorgeous she was compared to me, she knew how ugly I was and that I was sorry I'd ever visited her in the first place. To this day I still feel so awful for writing that letter. She could only see the fun time we were having - I was the one with the complex about my teeth.	0

41413	I lost an online video game tournament that I had been trying for several years to win.  Truthfully, my team has always came in 2nd or 3rd for several years, and as one of the top players, I really really wanted to come in 1st place one year because I felt I worked hard for it and I deserved it.  It was the last year the tournament would be running and I got trolled by some guy who didn't like me who was a guild leader of a different team by recruiting a player that was widely agreed to be a lesser tier player and who also didn't like me.  They ended up coming in first place and of course the other guild leader and everyone else who didn't like me trolled the hell out of me and threw it in my face because everyone knew I wanted my team to come in first that year since my team never came in first and it was likely the last year of the tournaments.  I pretty much wanted to smash my monitor with a chair and then set it on fire and then go cry in a corner	0

Each day we woke up and went about our day, not knowing it our holiday would be cut short. This was a stressful time for me as I had always wanted to go to Disney and it was my first ever time and I was going to be gutted if it got cut short. However, we were able to enjoy our holiday and although the park did close, it closed at the end of our very last day there so we were able go travel home as planned, having had our whole holiday and we didn't need to claim anything back on our holiday insurance.	0

4594	I felt ... when a man I had feelings for was not responding to my text messages. I have an iPhone and so I use iMessage with others who also have iPhones. When you use iMessage, the chat bubbles are blue, but I noticed one day that the chat bubbles with him were green. That indicates that the recipient does not have an iPhone, or that they are in an area without internet and therefore are getting the messages sent as text messages rather than iMessage. The problem was that he had not been responding and I started wondering if he was seeing my texts at all - then I had a suspicion he had blocked me this entire time. I messaged a mutual friend to ask if he had told them he was angry with me, and I then checked to see if I could still see his profile on social media platforms. I could not. I started getting anxious at the indication that he had blocked me on everything, and that anxiety skyrocketed with each profile I wasn't seeing. My friend told me she could still access his profiles, and it was then I realized he had blocked me on everything.	0
