My experience is the collection agency will not correct the debt on the credit report! we need a law requiring the collection company to report debt repayment or debt settlement to the credit bureau in a timely manner... Say 30 days after the debt has been settled, or payment arrangements have been made. It can be very hard to clean up your credit when working with collection companies... they want their money but they don't care if your credit report is accurate!  	1
"Dan says that the ""Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) prohibits creditors from using automated dialing systems to call cell phone numbers without consent from the customer"" and that sounds reasonable if that were true. I receive countless ro-bo calls on my cell, to which most never leave a message so there is no way to report it. To add to that, I have sent written notice to all creditors not to call my cell because of the charges, yet someone is calling. I do not answer those unknown calls because I have nothing more to add to any previous calls about the debt. The only call that has ever left a message is about a debt for someone else, too which I called and told them ithey have the wrong number and not to call, but they still call.  "	1
The EU - we are here in Brussels to talk about the EU and the individual states - the EU should, in my view, take more care that the external borders are closed; that it is checked that no illegal immigrants seep into the individual states and - well - maybe also take away the work of the locals. So, the EU is challenged and then, of course, the individual states within the EU.	0
The name of the agency is the CONSUMER Financial Protection Bureau not the Collector Financial Protection Bureau. The industry have their lobbyists and consumers have the CFPB. The goal is to protect consumers from illegal practices by certain industries and that sometimes means more regulations.  	0
That's not fair. We don't import this democracy, no, that's not it. But the problem is that they even prevented. When we win elections, and they bring a lot of money to keep their candidate in office, that's it. If it wasn't for that, people they are mostly with the - now with internet everything, even children - a little African of nothing, he can read, he knows what it is, democracy, he knows that it is to run a country but they have become of that, that is the problem.	0
As someone who has dealt for over two years with a rogue collections company putting a debt I don't owe on my credit report, I think these debt buyers should be disallowed by law. Legitimate third parties can operate, but these fly by night businesses who buy for pennies on the dollar without a care as to whether the books are correct should be fined and put out of business. In other words, the regulations should be so tough that they can't afford to stay open. They only wreak havoc on people. I have dealt with an unscrupulous company for two years; my state Attorney General was involved in getting it removed from my credit report with 1 agency, only to have this company report the same to another agency. No collection should be allowed on the credit report until verified 100%. And if the debt is more than 2 years old, the creditor must notify the supposed debtor in writing and allow 30 days for a response--denial, request for proof, payment, etc.--before putting it on the credit report.  	1
I have a charged off loan which I have been trying to get a repay plan on but the debt is listed as one amount on my CBR and the debt collector had the balance increased by $12K more when discussing it over the phone. That is outrageous that they do not have an accurate amount of what is owed to the original lender.  	1
"I meant to say, ""all lawyers should be banned from being debt collectors."" They are unethical and work strictly out of greed to circumvent the laws that are supposed to protect consumers. Verification of debts should require the creditor to provide written proof of the initial debt instrument with the consumers' signature. There should be a notarized statement of authenticity along with it. This gives a consumer the documents to file a civil suit for fraud, if needed.  "	0
Aborting a fetus which is not viable is choosing to remove life support, a choice granted to the host of life support due to the fetus not being an independent and competent adult. Doing this via abortion could be compared to an overdose of morphine rather than pulling the plug and letting the entire existence of the fetus off life support be a much slower and certain death. This would also be the choice of the host of life support. If the fetus is not a part of the woman's body, then she may remove from her body that which is not a part of her at any time she sees fit. This is not a matter of abortion as much as it is a right to remove what is not your body from your body.	0
The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau needs to have a large core of undercover agents that get jobs at collection agencies, credit agencies and servicers. These agents need full federal law enforcement powers with guns and badges so they can perp-walk suspects out of their offices and take them to federal holding facilities for trial when they have proof of criminal activity. Currently it seems many creditors, servicers and debt collectors consider themselves above the law. There's only two ways to discourage that thinking and that's jail time and/or fines. After conviction, victims should receive a framed and signed (first name or nickname of the agent) photograph of the perp-walk. They usually don't get their money back but that's something they will treasure.  	0
My name is Gisela. In my opinion we need to make a distinction between legal and illegal immigration, so they are two completely separate phenomena and maybe we just need to start by making that distinction.	0
In my opinion yes, it is the first need. One should be able to communicate in this language. We talk here about tolerance, that we should communicate with the close ones and neighbours and the language is needed to achieve this. In Holland, we have this approach that everything starts with the language. We even have this portal: everything starts with language.nl.  	1
What bothers me, so unfortunately with us in Germany the EU seems too small, too little information about these organizations, because if I think now again of the election with estimated 30, 40 percent participation, then that's a pity and actually harms what is done here.	1
So I have but this percentage from the General Secretariat from the Prison Administration. So if you look at the total population, so you see a 15 percent participation and so the number of prison inmates that end up in prison, that's 25 percent of the total prison [population?] and so. so it's not about 10 percent of immigrants that end up in prison, that is, there's obviously a difference between the percentages of national	1
I believe abortion is not pro-choice in the sense that the baby itself is not the woman's body. CMV! To be clear, I'm not hear to discuss whether abortion is right or wrong as there are many more sides to that matter than just a woman's right to her body. I just believe that a fetus is a separate entity from the woman, it having a separate DNA for example, that the fate of the fetus is not part of a woman's right to her own body, being that is isn't actually wholly her body. Am I wrong in thinking this? I'd like to know. Again, let us refrain from discussing abortion itself as right or wrong as that is not what I want to discuss here. I believe there are many other arguments for and against abortion and in practical terms, what I want to discuss may mean little, but I would like to come to a better understanding of this particular argument.	0
Let's keep it as simple as possible. Based on 3rd party disclosure statue blocking the ID benifits the consumer. One never knows who is at the other end of the phone.  	0
I made a comment below and would like to know how to make them stop calling me for my deadbeat kids debt. I tell them either I will pass on the info or that I have no contact info for them. Only one collector took me off their list. I am still being harrassed by 10 others. I am being forced to drop my land line which I have had for 40 years to get away from them. It really bugs me because I have a near perfect score of 797 .  	1
Once the consumer is located then nearbys, neighbors, relatives, prior used phone numbers may be abused by collectors to harass and embarrass consumers, or even to compel a relative or other third party to pay the debt. Violations of the FDCPA should be treated as serious breaches of law.  	0
The problem with the whole story is that first of all the cost of living has to be equalized - that includes, of course, wages, or salaries. If that - I assume we are only Poles and Germans here - and an Austrian, excuse me Julian - that we, I think, as I have come to know it - I have just said, we have a twin town in Poland - the cost of living was at least two years ago in Poland much lower than in Germany and then of course higher wages have to be paid here, so that you can buy the piece of bread, which is correspondingly lower in Poland and that's why Frankfurt/Oder to the other side is a constant border traffic. Buying gas in Poland is just much cheaper than in Frankfurt/Oder on the border. So the problem is simply that the cost of living in the individual states is so different that you can't equate it with wages and salaries at all.	1
Paying a debt in full will always improve a credit score unless the debt is over 7 years old. If that is the case, I'm sure you can make a request to the financial institution to not report the payment.  	0
No robo-calls or automated dialing systems should be allowed for any profit-making or solicitation purpose. Period. You can call me if a tornado is coming, but if you want money, you have to use a person. And I don't see why I should pay for the call.  	0
But it also comes from our ex-colonies, from Latin America; we live the same case. In fact, colonies that have a link with Spain; in Latin America, there is always a very close relationship with Spain. Those who come from Africa, that's another debate altogether. But in relation to culture, those who come from Latin America, indeed, they are (...) Spanish-based.	0
I think that privacy concerns regarding account information are valid. Others knowing about collections should not weigh nearly as much as good-faith efforts of collectors to notify and collect outstanding debt.  	0
In reaction, I think that the problem is indeed illegal immigration but in the sense that, in my opinion, we must strongly sanction the employers who exploit these people who come knowing that if they do not employ people illegally, they would employ them legally. And at that moment, these people would contribute like everyone else, they could benefit from social security, they could have a home and not go to live in our villas and effectively, at that moment, we would no longer pay attention to the names on the mailboxes, because there would really be integration. So finally, in my opinion, we must act very strongly on all these people who take advantage of this poverty and these illegal immigrants. [1 :	0
So...this is awkward. Because I'm not single. And for the past 8 years or so, I've been horrible at remaining single, despite several sacred oaths to stop dating. But I'm also short, poor, unemployed, a few rare shades of mentally ill, a few common types of physically ill and I'm certainly not making up for it in looks. Did I mention I'm terrified to the point of flight or fight or, if I can't escape, fetal position paralysis when anything even vaguely sexual happens? Because it's not the social handicap you'd imagine. At least, not with other introverts...or trolls with a fucked up sense of humor. ... So, yeah, my girlfriend is both of these. She likes it when other people are more afraid than her... But nevermind that. You're right, a lot of people will never find love. For some, that's a happy ending. Bullet dodged. As for those who do want to find love, well, most find their way there. What are they doing right? It's not like it's a big secret... Stop approaching love like it's a fairy tale. If you're just looking for love, it generally means you're in love with love the way Wallstreet can't enough cocaine, or you're just desperate for someone to save you from drowning alone. Both are considered great warning signs in anyone over 17. Because there are a lot of people out there who are terrible for each other. The girl who is trying to survive a pornographic Night of the Living Dead reality is not going to respond well to the guy who confuses the dirty sense of humor she picked up along the way for an actual proposition. The guy who has been mocked for his old fashioned romantic ideals doesn't need to hear that he's creepy from the woman who was suffocated by old fashioned romantic ideals before she ever met the guy, nor does she need to hear his insults because she still goes to church. The woman who paid all the bills in the last relationship needs some stability and support, but people who read her profile think she's a shallow golddigger. One of them is a guy who pays child support to the woman who cheated on him and gave him a persistent cold sore. Former victims of abuse keep meeting up with new abusers. Etc, etc, the variety is endless. You know how it goes. Without working with any specifics, we can't hope to change your mind. Any advice we give to those without love will be wrong for someone, somewhere... Edit: But who wants to play it safe? Here's a few tips. Don't confuse them for anything in-depth. They're mostly here to break up some myths about how difficult all of this is. Appearance: learn the color wheel, and how it can compliment your skin tone and highlight your eyes. Trust me, it's witchcraft. Fitness: Work out enough to at least not be dead if you need to climb two flights of stairs or go for a walk together. Beyond that, it varies. Some women want a steel panther, some women want someone skinny, some women want a soft pillow. Some just skip down to the next category... Intelligence: You know how to Google, right? You can speed read the results faster if you don't mentally read them out loud to yourself. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions. The more open ended, the better. (You may need to apologize in advance, depending on how much you should already know...) Smile: when you mean it. Faking it? If it only lifts your lips, you're making everyone who can read your eyes very uncomfortable. Listening: Active listening, without judgement. If you're not good at it, you'd better be damn entertaining about it. If you can't manage either, throw a saving dice, and look for a girl who is just as bad. A lot of genuine love is finding someone who understands and forgives you for what you can't do. Memories: You'd be amazed what making weird in-jokes nobody else can understand can do for two people. Don't force it. Let it grow naturally. Oh yeah, and let people know you're interested in them...but don't pressure them for an answer right away or corner them. Practice makes perfect. Location to start things off: Make friends who have friends. Get a hobby. Avoid anywhere where the men greatly outnumber the women. It's not like online dating sites and Reddit are the only places in the world.	1
"Disputes are not investigated. That is a joke. Sending out a letter to whoever these debt collectors think is responsible for the debt is just rote -- it is not done in good faith or follow the letter of the law. They 1) use vague names, no signature, post office boxes, a million aliases for their debt collection business THAT practice has to stop). The FTC says ""reasonable"" investigation but these companies do none, and that is the standard practice. A good start is having a realistic and fair and honest laws requiring the companies to verify debt without already having assumptions or worse, not caring if they have the right person or not. Any rule change needs to carry some penalty or it won't have any impact on an industry that has run roughshod over consumers now for two decades. Abuses abound. There also should be special requirements for validating medical debt because of privacy rights. There seems to be no concern of violating people's privacy when it comes to medical debt collection activities.  "	0
"Kantiab Ethics has a few glaring holes IMO. The first is that the idea that, ""an action can be considered good if it can be willed as a universal maxim."" But not everyone will ever agree on a maxim, so they're can never be a universal maxim. For instance, ""Do not kill."" that can easily be considered a universal maxim. And yet there are a thousand reasons &amp; oppositions you can give to that. What if your in war? What if you're defending yourself? What your forced to kill someone? What if your religion tells you to kill someone? Or what if you just enjoy killing people? Another major problem is that in order to create these maxims Kan says we must eliminate all are emotional connections &amp; think purely with reason. This is impossible. Why? Because your very way of thinking is based upon your emotional connections. The things you may consider ""bad"" or ""good"" is based purely upon the ideas that you have formed based upon numerous encounters with friends, family, strangers &amp; the media. It's impossible to divide yourself from this. Kant's perspective from the very start asks too much &amp; is impossible. We are rational creatures, but our rationality of what is ethical comes from what our environment has told us is ethical, &amp; no one can every agree on a universal maxim, so there by definition is no ""universal"" maxim"	0
A standard first letter would be an excellent idea - especially if states would agree on the content. Consumers could recognize the format and know where to look for the information they need. Consumer testing would be a very good idea. I believe that industry members would favor this to reduce litigation over technical violations. Taxpayers would benefit by reduced federal court expenses.  	0
To her opinion: I also think that if we want to help people or provide development aid, then we should really do it in such a way that we also know what happens with the money. And you could also suggest to these countries, if you then send the people back again, so either you take the people in now or there is nothing more, that could be done. I don't know how to do that technically, it's all very complicated with politics, but I think you just have to try it, so that it's always earmarked. And I mean, there are also good examples: Karlheinz Böhm in Ethiopia has achieved quite a bit. I mean, it is only a small beginning, but if there is a state behind it - or several countries or the EU behind it, then something like this would certainly bring much greater success and one could then really perhaps prevent that this terrible misery in Somalia or wherever else stops, that the people there starve and they have no possibility at all to earn money or to get anything to eat or to have water. One would have to send this money, which flows there or also perhaps, one needs also perhaps also no money there but any technicians, engineers or yes, people who make there such things then. That you get the misery under control in a different way, so that the people don't have to think about coming to us in order not to starve.	1
What Alberto was saying was also very accurate. That is to say, when the economy is going well, we have to see that the Western countries have helped themselves in a certain way. It's a bit like getting more mobile figures. They look for firemen, doctors, etc., by qualifying the individuals only in relation to their profession. And when we talk about immigration chosen by the state or by companies, we are well within this; we are not talking about looking for individuals, human beings, but we are talking about looking for skills, assuming that when we no longer need them, people will go home, which can be envisaged, but the problem is that things never happen like that and if we, in our countries, which are certainly in crisis and in fear [? ], extremely protected from many things, we are one day confronted with choices of departure of this type. I am losing my family and I am not sure that my first thought would be to say to myself, does the country I want to go to absolutely need me as a graphic designer or as a doctor? I would think, is it going to be better for me if I go there. That's why people immigrate. So it's not necessarily what we want when they come to us. But that's why people come, it's not for anything else. They don't come for... So, that's one aspect of it. So, and especially what bothers me about this, in the stories of selected immigration and quotas, it means that people come with a certain profile and it's assumed that they're not going to change their [professional] path. And this will be the case more and more. Today, professional paths are no longer linear. You're not going to enter an activity and leave it at retirement. If (... ...) there is a retirement. If we refuse this flexibility, we will have neither the disadvantages nor the benefits, and in terms of benefits, I think that having flexibility on immigration will also mean that things will inevitably balance out. Now, I think we can see that Spain is in a period that France has experienced   and that it will perhaps recognize again. But we can see that the perception is different from what we say, stems a lot from this somewhat violent confrontation that you have at the moment, in fact, with the added situation of crisis that exacerbates all this. That's it.	1
What we have in this third sector of EU policy, we have economy, agriculture and common foreign and security policy and it is the field that needs to be worked on most intensively, namely, so to speak, internal European policy issues, plus asylum law. We have made progress at the pan-European level with binding laws for the Europol police. At least there, when it comes to security interests, politicians find it, let's say, easier to get to Porte. Then it will become clear that we already have approaches - I'm not a specialist, I'm waiting for the experts - we have approaches to minimum standards, for asylum accommodations, for example. We are obligated to the Basic Law and the European fundamental rights, and especially with regard to those who have come to us - whether legally or illegally, or from Africa or Asia - we have basic obligations from our values. And that must provide the basis. I could imagine, without being a politician now, that you start there, just as you have to introduce social status. We don't have a discourse on that. There are minimum wages, but whether they are always enforced is something else. That's where I have to start. And that is the task of the politicians in the EU, unfortunately our parliament has no right of initiative, and to bring the 27 states under one hat, with Berlusconi and the boat people, these are the real problems, we must not talk them down. So there are enormous problems, but I think, to round it off again, as with internal security, domestic policy, Schengen Agreement, border control, only the external borders are controlled, the national borders are not controlled. From Poland he can drive through the Czech Republic to Germany, from Spain he can drive through France, but where is the border? They know less about that in the south, between Belarus and Poland and between Ukraine and Poland. There we have sharp borders with German policemen, German know-how, German money. Why shouldn't German money go in at some point, for example in the partner country, which I would like to support, a selected country, where I contribute to it, and if I only make a big social experiment, I take a former German colony, invest a few million there and see if I can help them to the extent that the pressure to migrate there - the reason for migration - becomes less. This should be done by the strong EU as a whole. Selected partner countries, where there are chances at all, because there are functioning governments, structures, these are prerequisites; legal systems, enforceable. You keep your treaties, please. Even Berlusconi is trying. I'm [... ...], I'm just interested politically. What did Berlusconi do, what did Spanish politics do, what did they do with Tunisia? An agreement. The Tunisians should take back the refugees.	1
"Vaccinations should be compulsory for all persons living in my society (USA, but applicable to all western countries). religious reasons should not be acceptable reasons to get out of it. CMV Vaccinations prevent diseases, period. They protect not only the person receiving them, but also those who are unable to receive them. This is what is referred to as the ""Herd Immunity."" If you are not vaccinated, but you never come into contact with someone else who is not vaccinated, then you are given a sort of protection by eliminating your own exposure. **Those who have a religious or ideological opposition to vaccination are therefore partially protected, despite their own opposition to the practice,** and should not be permitted this protection by being present in a society that has taken the effort to vaccinate them. The only excuse I am ready to accept without argument is a medical excuse for vaccination: If a vaccination will cause injury to an individual due to allergies or immune deficiency, then they should be exempt. Change my View. **∆ and Clarifications**: The specific vaccines I feel should be ""compulsory"" are those that are approved by a panel of experts on the subjects (from Immunology, epidemiology, virology, microbiology, etc), but I expect these would include childhood vaccines TDaP, MMR, Hep B, MCV4, IPV, Varicella, and before long the HPV vaccine. Criteria should include: Severity of associated disease, and record of safety during optional vaccination period. All vaccines should be provided at no cost through some governmental or insurance program. Any medically sound excuse, including but not limited to allergies, immunodeficiency, guillan barre syndrome, etc should be valid to excuse an individual from receiving a vaccine, as it would be unsafe for them to receive it. This does not excuse religious exemptions. Many of you have made the argument that you cannot force a person to get an injection/put something in their body, and I do find that argument compelling. I would be open to a more stringent application of existing rules: 1. All children must be vaccinated in order to attend any school or daycare. 2. Parents who wish to homeschool their children must complete an education course on vaccination and pass an exam on how vaccines work, or have their children vaccinated. 3. Adults must provide prospective employers with a letter from a doctor indicating that they are vaccine compliant (ie, have been vaccinated or have a medically recognized reason for not being vaccinated), or the employer may choose not to hire them due to their failure to get vaccinated. 4. No federal agency will accept an application without a doctor's letter indicating vaccine compliance. 5. Doctor's letter of Vaccine Compliance is also required for a driver's license, but not for a passport. It is required for re-entry to the country. Edit: Thanks everyone! I will write more replies later, but I have a proposal due on my influenza vaccine research tomorrow, and I need to get my ass back to work."	0
Yeah okay but so what we want to do is certainly not create a police state. But those who come illegally, we should not frighten them too much but we should note that this illegal is still a human being and therefore we must also take into consideration all the social aspects, it's very important and I have always said that - so for example those who receive aid for example, I have always said: here, what do you want? These are people who receive an allowance from the state but in fact this money is immediately invested and immediately used so that is another thing obviously, for example if we give subsidies for example to an African state or an African emperor, at that point this money will never reach the people who need it so we must also understand that those who want to come, that we must help and that we cannot immediately punish them, so we must have a certain amount of trust too.	0
I think we could take some parts of each solution in order to create a separate solution, which would include the points of every solution in part. And I think that none of those solutions is good enough to be the only one. 	0
State regulations should preempt them from collecting exorbitant returns on such minimal investment (usury!!!). Other items to consider pertaining to this issue are : The bad debt buyer does not disclose what he/she purchased the bad debt for. This should be disclosed and transparent as they have the original debt information, including SSN, phone and financial information. I don't begrudge them making a profit , but their predatory practices need to be regulated. A superior court judge should be able to examine the original transaction, all the documents concerning the purchase of this debt by a third party and determine a fair and equitable payment to resolve the problem, avoiding bankruptcy .  	0
I would suggest a visit to the Federal Bankruptcy Rule 3001(effective 12/1/2012) and comments made during the proposed period, plus the hearing presentation statements published and are available. The Rule already addresses documentation issues. I again see that attaching all of the proposed documentation to the validation notice is not productive for the consumer or the sender. I do believe additional documentation as to chain of title be available if a consumer is being sued in Court.  	0
Because it it the consumer's phone and that is their right! Why should the consumer pay to be harassed?! Put the cost of doing this business where it belongs, which is on the companies not the consumers!

"If I were to guess (and sorry, but I don't feel like researching this from work), I would say that the relevant argument probably deals with two issues: 1. Is it possible for an animal to become traumatized in ways that are not readily apparent during the act itself? If trauma can manifest *after* the fact, then there might be no reasonable way of protecting the animal except to ban bestiality in its entirety. 2. Assuming the potential harm *is* apparent beforehand, the question becomes whether we trust the person seeking the activity to be the one to judge. If you're looking to get your jollies with your poodle Fifi, are you going to notice a subtle ""no"" clue from a small animal that could never physically resist (or is too scared to)? These two issues are a lot of why statutory rape laws exist - not because we think that all 16 year olds are incapable of a mature sexual relationship, but because a lot of them are and it's not always easy to tell beforehand which are and which aren't. To make it worse, we don't trust the ones encouraging the relationship to make a sound judgment on that issue."	0
Any FTC rule regarding verification should absolutely include an exception for frivolous and irrelevant disputes because there are way too many websites out there providing sample dispute letters and the advice to keep using them that the process is abused by enough debtors that we now have a standard letter to address this issue.  	0
How about allowing arbitrators to not be bound entirely by the law, but also by common sense when it comes credit card defaults? Common sense tells us that if a Colorado flood washes away a community, those in the community are possibly not going to be able to pay their credit card bills for a few months. Common sense tells us that a medical emergency, being the victim of a hit and run accident, destruction of a home, or becoming an unpaid CareGiver for a family member should take precedence over the monthly payment requirement.  This is not about debt forgiveness,  its about declaring a debt neutral, no more penalties, fees or interest rate charges are applied to the debt, and the debtor agrees to pay off the debt in a reasonable manner, even if it takes 10 years to do so. __URL__	0
You have to help people in those countries, you say. In Iraq, for example, there have been people who have fled the country, there has been a war, there has been Saddam Hussein.

There needs to be something in place to stop the frivilous law suits that agencies have to spend thousands of dollars to defend even though they have tried to explain to the consumers / attorneys that there was no wrong doing and no case a lot of these consumers file the suits Pro Se and continue pushing for a settlement or trial in these cases the agencies spend monies to prove there was no cause for action to begin with and to have a judge agree with the agency. Please look at putting some kind of penalty on consumers or their attorneys when they send settlement demands or file law suits when they have been shown that there is / was no case  	0
I think what we're talking about here are completely different subjects. There is on the one hand the adaptation to the customs of the country that welcomes you and on the other hand, it is to leave the things that you bring with you. And to have to adapt - in fact, in all our history, we have always been a household of cultures, there were the Chinese carthages until the beginning of the 20th century. And then from the beginning of the 20th century, we became a country of immigrants. So, we cannot compare ourselves to the French, for example, who have a much longer history of welcoming immigrants. They have to tell us about the problem; if there is a problem, in any case. And about what the majority [of them] think, namely: Should we reduce illegal immigration? Because finally I think that was a theme raised by the moderator. So I would like to know here, since everyone here has been randomly selected, French, Spanish, and then we have a Belgian too I think, what they think finally. So I would like to have some feedback.	0
I think there should be a minimum wage for everyone, what [they] can do in England and in France, they should be able to do here. If it's always pushed forward, then the Chinese come and clean our houses. I don't know, I don't take the houses to China to clean them, and if the Chinese come here to clean the house, then they also get the minimum wage. In my opinion, there should be no other way. So if I go to the hairdresser... I won't go to the hairdresser in China if he takes one mark from me. That's ridiculous, something like that.	0
So I think we don't consciously perceive the EU as of how many bills EU law has to be implemented on German law, on national law, even on law on the ground - on community law; I think we are not aware of that at all. This is going on in the background and we are not even aware of it. I think it is very important that we become aware of the fact that EU law is being implemented in many cases. If I have just followed the report, I think migration should still be a national issue, because the statement was actually: The EU creates the framework, but ultimately this is such a differentiated issue that everyone must look at their own local situation, how it can be implemented. And then I think we are actually avoiding the real debate: We are talking about the fact that the people who are there can live together, door to door, but the problem is that people in other countries who are in a very bad situation come over here illegally and we are actually discussing how to turn the illegal people into legal people. But the issue is actually, how do we prevent illegality; that is, how do we prevent these people from having to come over here illegally? Or, yes, what do we create that they have an incentive, either in their home countries - that they're doing well in their home countries - or what are the ways that they can be here legally without us ultimately giving up - giving up everything.	0
I think sexual exclusivity in the age of birth control is asinine. CMV. If my partner wants to spend his or her free time (time that wouldn't be devoted to our partnership anyway) having safe sex (no pregnancy or STIs) with someone else, why should I interfere? And if my partner discovers that being with that someone else more of the time makes them happier, I should be glad that they are happier. Otherwise I'm just being selfish and possessive. In older times, when sex could easily mean babies or disease, having it with someone else could really damage your ability to fulfill your responsibilities to your partner. Today, sex can be safe and recreational. If a man finds out that his girlfriend had a great time and got laid after going out with the girls last night, he should be happy for her. If he doesn't value her happiness, why is he in a relationship with her? If he does value her happiness, why would he limit her pursuit of it as long as that pursuit doesn't limit his own?	0

"I don't see any reason not to institute mandatory background checks (which red flags from the background check would make you ineligible is another issue) or institute some sort of gun license so long as the fee is not exorbitant and the process for applying for the license is not too difficult or restrictive. However, the mental health evaluation you suggest sounds like it would have more room for abuse and would have a tendency to be expensive for the potential gun owner (if you're thinking about an appointment with a certified psychologist). Paperwork demonstrating transfer of ownership, similar to what we do for cars, also sounds like a good idea. I don't think a gun owner should be held accountable if one of their guns is stolen and used in a crime any more than a car owner would be held accountable if their car were stolen and then used in a crime. However, as with cars, if you fail to properly transfer ownership of a gun and that gun is used in a crime, there should probably be some consequences for you, though obviously not as severe as for the person who actually perpetrated the crime. I don't think that owners of ""semiautomatic handguns, assault weapons or large magazines"" should be subject to ""frequent and intrusive recertifications."" The license/background check, if we instituted one, should be the same as for a hunting rifle. I could be convinced otherwise if research showed that semiautomatic handguns, etc. were more likely to be involved in a violent crimes, accidents, and/or suicides than hunting rifles and shotguns, but as far as I know, such data does not exist for the US--in large part because the NRA keeps shooting itself in the foot (ha!) by blocking the funding of organizations that want to do this kind of research. I seem to remember a post recently with data from another country (Australia maybe?) showing that deaths caused by assault weapons, etc. were negligible compared to deaths caused by hunting rifles and shotguns. The only gun I own is a semi-automatic .22 caliber handgun with a 10-shot magazine that I won in a raffle when I was 16 (I didn't technically own it until I turned 21--my father did). I enjoy shooting targets with my dad, but it's not my favorite thing in the world. I do not believe that my .22 ""semi-automatic"" weapon makes me a dangerous person. I also do not believe it will help me stand up against a totalitarian government (nor do I fear the US turning into such a government in my lifetime). However, I would like to keep it and would rather not pay several hundred dollars for a license or undergo rigorous psychiatric examination in order to maintain ownership of my property. If reliable research showed that my type of gun was 10 times more likely to be involved in a violent crime than a hunting rifle, then I would reluctantly deal with the new regulations or (more likely) sell my gun to someone who was willing to deal with the regulations. I wouldn't raise much of a fuss because I like reading and Reddit more than shooting. But my father would be very upset since his primary hobbies do involve guns, and it would make me sad to see him go through the type of bureaucracy that you propose, especially without a reasonable demonstration beforehand that the changes would actually result in a reduction of gun violence. Again, I think the NRA is more to blame for the lack of research we have than anyone else. Stop the NRA from continuing their shenanigans, present me with some cold, hard facts or reasonable projections, and my views could change significantly."	1
"I will be brief. The theme is always the same. We are talking about the second generation. And there is also the second in France, the third. And the second generation in France, we are talking about another type of immigration. [...] there was the Portuguese immigration in times of ""thin cow"". There are many Portuguese who left for France. And finally there are many people who have French citizenship and do not return to Portugal. But this is perhaps the most serious problem that affects Portugal. This is the problem that our colleague has placed here. And it is a very serious problem. I know about it because I have many American friends. Friends of all ages. And I know that there are a lot of parents who came to work and they really, they are forced... finally the children do not follow the parents. It's the same thing in the United States, so there's a certain ghetto that's created with very specific cultures sometimes from the United States itself but mixed with African practices. There is even a certain hatred towards Portuguese that is quite serious. So this is sometimes against the opinion of their parents. They content what the parents have sown? I have a sense there. I really feel that it is very difficult for me to say whose fault it is, finally. That's the question I don't know. This question comes from the questionnaire and I don't know how to answer. It's a serious problem, it's a problem that makes me really sad. I'm not really a racist but it's a very serious problem. I don't agree with the American solution of sending this person back to their country. Because that's what we do, that's what parents and children separate. I don't agree with that. But I honestly don't know if there's a solution to this problem. So I don't know. I don't have a solution. It's always immigration. It's second generation immigration. And this is a very serious problem that has really... we have this in the Lisbon area, for example. Around Lisbon. There is always a concentration. And then there are customs, there are really different behaviors of the Portuguese and it's really the war that still exists. And now I wanted to finish, well.   I see all this. The whites that live in this area don't end up healing, the behavior of this group. So it can really start in the school. We really need to do something to solve the situation, because it's a very, very serious situation. [16.00]"	1
CMV: Being spied upon does not take away your freedoms. What are you not free to do if you are spied on that you were free to do before? There are things that many people do that are illegal that they can't do if they are spied on, but the aren't _really_ free to do them if they aren't spied on, they just get away with it. Being spied on is obviously different if a specific person you know is doing the spying, but the government/FBI/CIA/etc. is not a specific person, its an organization. If they watch you have sex or whatever that doesn't effect your life at all except maybe for some discomfort at the fact that you might be on tape, which I think people should just get over. Note: this does not mean I condone widespread spying by the government, I just think that freedom is not a good argument to use against spying. There are plenty of other good ones to use.	0
I would like to say something about this. I think that there is less tolerance for people from other cultures. Geerd Wilders in our country, the Netherlands, is a bit of a spokesman for all this intolerance, for intolerant people. And I think that these are processes that consolidate each other. They reinforce each other. The more tolerant the native becomes, the more the non-native withdraws. But it can also be a phenomenon of the world in some ways that it is a tendency to be oneself, to find one's identity, to find one's roots. To stay with those roots. It can be something of the transient nature too. It doesn't have to be something alarming.	1
Wrong or not, here is a friend's (#1) experience with another slutty female friend (#2): * Friend #2 is slutty, so brings a different date to each event. Requiring friend #1 to constantly interact with new people at parties/events where it is supposed to be close friends only * Friend #2 is slutty, so sleeps with other male friends of female friend #1, forcing situation where friend #1 must 'Choose sides' and ruined friendship with the guy friend, who she really liked. * Friend #2 is never available to do things as a 'couple' with friend #1 who is in a committed relationship, because friend #2, is never in a relationship. * Every evening spent with friend #2 becomes about her dating life. This is normal in female friendships, when one member of a group has a new relationship. But, because friend #2, is *always* in the throes of a new relationship/partner, she manipulates the groups 'new relationship' time. and causes drama. Like the time when she had to use emergency contraceptives. OR the guy turned crazy. * Going out for a 'girls night' ends up with #2 hooking up with someone, leaving friend #1 to go home early, or be alone. * Women also often don't trust promiscuous women to be around their own partners. Its why 'slutty' girls only hang out with other 'slutty' girls. And why girls in long term, committed relationships i.e.e 'nice girls', don't enjoy spending time with 'slutty' girls. So, while I wouldn't argue that its **wrong** (because right and wrong are so vague, anyways), I would say it is socially unacceptable, and that these are some examples of why. I would also like to point out, that I think it has *nothing* to do with jealousy. I think it is about preserving social structure.	0
I would like to quickly respond, so I have a good experience, that is so a family, from Mongolia, they came back and so there is now one of the daughters who did a doctorate in German language and so another son did an exam in German, so I don't know any person where you could say here it is, he just learned by heart and then he forgot everything, to get this certificate. So I was just lucky enough to have only good experiences.	1
No, I didn't say that we should close the borders, I said that we should balance the European migration flows before we start calling on people from outside Europe. So I'm not against all the immigration that comes from people outside of Europe because maybe there are some places where there may be a shortage of people but when in Ireland they are short - I believe that in Ireland, but I don't know enough from which country, but they didn't have enough people anymore, they first took people from Europe before starting with people from elsewhere.	1
"Modern artists I met have the same basic skills as those who paint in a more classic style. They all know how to draw straight lines, how to blend colors correctly, use perspective, etc. If modern art really ""[took] no skill"", then you'd think everybody would be able to do what they do. You'd be surprised at how much probably went into making that solid blue work. Imagine how different the impact would be if it were a different shade, or the dimensions of the frame were a bit different. I'm not an artist (I'm a CS student of all people), but even just a minute amount of exposure to the practice behind art will allow you to understand how these paintings work."	1
Well, I agree with all those who had a say, but what is important for me is that also the people who are here illegally and who have very often, for example, health problems and no money to go to see a doctor - This is really nothing good - neither for them nor for their families and it is a reason for suffering.   	0

I believe that organ donation should be mandatory. CMV. Recent legislation has passed in Wales to require people who do not want their organs to be donated on their death to [opt out of the system]( rather than the current system where they have to opt in if they do. I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but that it doesn't go far enough. I believe that all people's organs should be made available for donation, if required and healthy, when they die. I believe this for a few reasons. Firstly, from a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I don't see how we can possibly justify not bringing as much good as possible from someone's death. If someone dies, and someone in the bed next to them requires their liver to be transplanted or they will also die, I don't see how anyone can justify not allowing them to have that liver transplanted into their body. If the shoe were on the other foot, I'm sure they would want that liver. I don't see how a religious objection can be brought to the table, because what religion would want one of their followers to deny life to another human being if it is in their power to do so? If a religion believes that abortion is murder, then it should also believe that refusing an organ donation is murder. I can only see positives to mandatory organ donation. CMV. *Edit: Your replies have me convinced. Thanks. Opt-out organ donation is the way to go. Opt in leaves too few organs, whereas mandatory donation upsets a metric fuckton of people for a huge number of reasons.*	0
Well, now the debate starts about what is being conducted in Holland. And to tell you the truth, it still causes problems. I have no binding response on this matter.

"A lot of excellent points made by MLegz13. My elderly parents needed help with day to day activities even if they were too proud to say anything. I stopped my award winning video business to be their CareGiver. Once the savings ran out, I had to default after 15 years of having a perfect credit card payment history. The debt collectors were constantly accusing me of being a ""refuse to pay"" even though I said I acknowledge the debt but had no income at the moment. It is this type of scenario that requires debts be frozen where they were at the time of default and in exchange the debtor agrees to pay off the debt, even if the initial monthly payments are just for a couple of dollars. What this does is free the debtor's phone lines so they can completely focus on moving forward rather than engage in pointless rat a tat with repetitive debt collection callers. It's why I started the Debt Neutrality Petition as well. If you click on the link PLEASE read the comments left by some of the 500 plus people who have signed the petition. Even a debt collector signed the petition, their comment speaks volumes of truth, as did all the others as well. <a target=""_blank"" href="""">Debt Neutrality Petition.</a>  "	1
From a collection standpoint, I can tell you that many creditors would LOVE to check with the DMV to get current address information. Unfortunately, many privacy laws make that impossible. It's also extremely common for people to fail to update their addresses either with their creditors or with the post office. Any legitimate collector wants to find the right person.  	0
I think limitation is good as not to harass. I think it has been generally defined as 3-4 days per day, though I think that is still excessive, and any collector who follows that is clearly trying to harass. Who else would someone call 3-4 times in a day? But, with the example of 1 call per day, I would think that there would also need to be another limitation such as 1 call per day or no more than 4 calls in a week. Otherwise, a collector could call 1 time a day, 7 times a week, 30 times in a month, etc. And personally, in my personal phone calls and in my business phone calls, it can take me more than a day or two to return a message. Customarily, in personal phone calls and business phone calls, if a message is left, the caller will leave a message and wait a couple of days before calling back if the person has yet to return the phone call. This is the way normal phone etiquette works--both in personal phone calls and in business calls. So, why should debt collections be different, why should they break the norms.  	1
"In the case of medical debt, the statement should inform the consumer of the date and location of the service provided, including the name of the doctor who was in charge of the case (rather than a consultant or firm that never contacted the consumer) or the commonly used name of the location (such as a hospital or clinic) where the service was performed. In my experience, cost-conscious consumers who are wary of scams have declined to pay legitimate medical debt because they did not recognize the debt and could not get an answer to the basic question, ""Why do I owe this money?"" When the debt is unexplained, it is prudent to refuse to send money, yet when the debt is in fact legitimate, the consumer may suffer severe penalties for failure to pay. A validation notice for medical debt should not simply repeat numerical codes or obscure abbreviations. It should state, ""You were billed on (DATE) when you went to (PLACE)."" If other debts related to the same visit have been paid, the letter should say so, e.g., ""You already paid for other services during this visit, but you still owe..."" Or, ""Your insurance paid for some of the costs of this visit, but you still owe...."" This issue is related to the absurd complexities of medical billing, but those complexities should not be used to conceal the origin of a debt from a consumer.  "	1
People shouldn't be given these drugs at all. If they want to use them, they should have to buy them. There is no reason the government should give people psychoactive drugs and there is no way we could afford them as is. The cost to medicate the entire US with adderall for a year, assuming a population of 313.9 million people taking one 20mg tablet given to them in packs of 60, which would be enough for two months, would cost over 103 billion dollars at the current market price of around 55 dollars per 60 20 mg tablets. Now eventually, this would wear off and the 20mg adderall would not be enough to give the same effects so we might bump the dosage to 30 mg and then bump it further to 40 mg tablets and since I'm not a doctor or somebody qualified, I couldn't tell you where that ends. The costs are utterly ridiculous and I don't think we would see a growth in tax revenue that would allow us to recoup our losses. Furthermore, there are some risks involved with adderall that could boost the cost of our healthcare across the country, and also the level of accidental death due to an adderall overdose. There are simply too many variables involved in giving people these drugs. However I would not discourage the purchase of these drugs by people willing to put their own money towards them as I support the legalization of all illegal and prescription drugs and their purchase without a prescription.	0
"As long as EVERYONE or no one is allowed the chance to take a break. I'm a non smoker and have worked for a company who only let smokers take breaks. I can get just as frustrated and angry as they can and yet I'm not allowed to go and do something to cool off for a few minutes? I've worked with smokers who don't smoke at work at all and you would never know. Some bring ""the patch"" or other means to help them get through the day. In the end it's not right to allow one to take it but not the other, no matter the reason. If someone is allowed to take a break and just don't, then that's on them."	1
I believe that some collection agencies attempt to coerce payment in order to reset the clock on debts that would otherwise be time-barred. The real issue here however is one of proper record keeping. The collection agencies may not be fully sure if the debt is time barred or not simply because it has passed hands several times. A transcript or log should be available to consumers upon request (at a minimum) showing when, where and who held the collection.  	0
I read the book more or less and there was a certain thing that I found complicated. For me a little too complicated. I can't really say what I find myself in. Because I can say that we live in Antwerp, and we have a lot of migration, especially from North Africa. And well, we have a travel agency, we have different clients who are very nice people, very good, round of very nice family etc. those who integrated with us towards, are really how to say, adapted. I mean, they speak the language, many of them work. And that I find very good that these people have done that. But there are also those who say, well, I'm a foreigner here, in Belgium, but when I arrive in Morocco, they also feel like foreigners because they have the impression of leaving there either. So there are people here who, in the end, do not want to work. I find this very serious. There are people who talk like that, or there are Moroccans who talk about other Moroccans. Well, I don't talk about Moroccans anymore, because we have a lot of Moroccan clients in our agency, so... and how can I say, for Moroccans, apparently things are very different. I don't know. I don't know where I should draw the line. Everywhere I find something that fits. Today I find myself or what. But I find it very complicated. [1 :	1
yes, so. Immigration and the corresponding. So, in the beginning, they were so prisoners. And if you go from national statistics, there you see now for example an immigration of 10-15 percent. And so increase in prison population, that's exactly equal to the number of immigration.	0
"Obama is by no means innocent in this. ""Campaign Obama"" was very critical of the Bush-era surveillance programs. Even in his 2009 inaugural address, he said ""“As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.” Fast forward to today, and not only has he done nothing to roll back these programs, but has greatly expanded them and actively defends them as necessary tools to ""protect"" us from terrorism etc. “I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience” Although you are correct however that the blame doesn't lay solely with him. - All the congress members that voted for all these controversial acts over the years that got us in this mess, they are all guilty as well IMO. - The senators like Dianne Feinstein and John McCain who were ""in the know"" and totally OK with all of this. - The Judges who should have put a stop to this, but allowed everything to continue on in secret. - The tech/communications companies that bent over backwards to help the government spy on their customers. (Although in all fairness, I don't think they have really had a chance to tell their side of the story yet. I don't think we know at this point exactly how much pressure was put on them by the government to go along with this.) This is what angers and frustrates me more than anything else, is the fact that **so many** of our representatives and public officials were in on this, and kept secret from the public how far the extent of this program is. In my opinion there are a lot of government employees that *at the very least* should be losing their jobs over this."	0
Regarding the migration of specialists: I study medicine and have a little bit of insight into the system and I don't want to sound presumptuous, I think I know very little, but the reason that many specialists migrate is simply that the working conditions are just terribly bad. And if they are better elsewhere, then they migrate and until the conditions are better there, then you don't need to talk about how to encourage people from elsewhere to stay here.	1
I would like to react to this as well, because in France we have experienced several waves of immigration, I would say, since for a fairly recent period they were brought in during the 70s and 75s for the automobile industry. And it is true that this first generation of migrants made considerable efforts to integrate, to learn the language, to give their children the opportunity to study, etc. And today what we see is that generations of children born in France, those who speak Arabic or other languages of origin and who need to rediscover their original identity, are finally, curiously, going backwards in relation to the process of integration, the efforts of their parents or grandparents to integrate. And they are reclaiming their origins by creating a community logic, since we have talked about the community question in France, which has never been valued in terms of political strategy - which has been the case in the United States but not in France. And today, well, it's the one chosen by the children of immigrants. So, it's true, it's questioning. It's questioning from a sociological point of view, I don't have an opinion on this question, but language is a way to mark one's identity, to claim it. But, at the same time, it is also a factor of self-exclusion in relation to a welcoming society. It's a question all the same. I know that I find it disturbing to hear kids talking to each other about being non-French.	1
it's good for, actually, I think it was [...] in the newspaper, that the number of illegals that the Netherlands has sent back, they say that they have to be sent back to the country of origin. They are sent back to Greece, also an EU country. But this is really a play that is being performed. Of the illegals here they have to be sent back to their countries of origin, they are sent to Greece. But they are already illegal there too. Well, well... we invest money, we have money circuits, but here it is an illegal circuit, we should try to improve this policy.	0
Maybe scorn is a bit a too strong word. This is probably caused by the world economic crisis. Also in Poland, there is at the moment less work than in other European countries, for example in Ireland. This is obvious that when Irish has no job it is better to give one to a citizen instead of give it to a foreigner.	0
Texts: No, text messaging and cell phones should be prohibited as there is not a viable means for the consumer to record the text and bring it into court as documentation if needed. All the issues raised about collectors calling the wrong individual or family members would be 100x worse with texting.  	0
Now I have a very different opinion on that: I think that especially immigration, migration should be a national issue, because different countries have very different problems. I still have the pictures from last year in my mind of Spain, where illegal immigrants came - so I think the border countries basically have a completely different issue there, like countries that don't have a border so directly. Then the individual EU countries have very different labor market situations: Some are desperately looking for workers, others have many. In other words, it can make sense for one country to allow immigration or migration, while others say we don't know how we'll manage and it will be difficult if we bring more people into the country. So from that point of view, I think it's better to leave this issue on the ground in the countries that it affects. You certainly can't impose a general status from the EU for the whole of Europe.	0
"My concern about a ""reasonable"" investigation is that it is so subjective. It opens the collector up to an entirely new avenue of prosecution. It is unlikely that a consumer and collector are ever going to agree on what is ""reasonable"". As it stands now courts have steadfastly maintained that collectors are allowed to rely on information given to them by their clients: ie: a debt for an amount stated against consumer so and so. Beyond that the consumer and the collector have the ability to ask a third party, a judge, to make a determination. By all appearances the FTC and the CFPB would place this burden directly on the collector, with predictable results: more needless litigation over the process and less resolution regarding the debt itself. One alternative might be for the rule to state a set formula for verification along with the proviso that if the collector follows it they are provided a safe harbor from litigation. However the myriad possibilities for reasonable investigation probably preclude anything so simple. In the end I think it is still a judges purvey to make the final determination.  "	0
"You raise an issue that has two distinct definitions: ""sent"" and ""received"" I don't think that any consumer wishes that they ""receive"" a notice that wasn't ""sent"" in the first place. In addition, letters and parcels get lost in the mail all the time. If there is a requirement for a credit/collector to ""send"" the notices you are referring to, the first place to send them are going to be an address that is on file. If the letters then get returned, then you would know that they are not at the address that is on file. But the letters have to be ""sent"" in the first place.  "	0
"In response to that, the problem what I see with that is that we then act as a teacher. Well, I know this from the guidelines that the IMF has given to some countries, which first of all have gone down the drain and secondly - historian, if I'm wrong, please check or correct - I keep thinking of Africa, which is closer to me than Iraq or Afghanistan or something like that, that there is such a history of colonialism, ""they're telling us again what we should do"", and that there is a tremendous resistance to it. Nothing against control, that corruption doesn't take place, but to tell them what to do with the money, I don't think that's necessarily met with opposition."	0
I agree with josephusmyer. Our son ran up small debts at several stores and banks around eight years ago. Debt-collectors (debt-buyers) have contacted him and threatened him with legal action on time-barred debts (without notifying him of the status).  	1
"Recently I received an ""offer"" from a firm indicating it would approve a new Visa or MasterCard account if I agreed to assume responsibility for a debt allegedly owed to another credit card firm. The first firm, which apparently was the original creditor, apparently sold the alleged debt to a third party. It was this third party that was making the ""offer"" to open a new credit account. Of course, there was a ""hook."" If I agreed to assume financial responsibility for the alleged debt and if the third party opened the new account, the credit limit would be for the alleged debt plus a significant ""service charge"" for the transaction. The finance charge was listed at 29%. Another questionable aspect of the matter was no guarantee a credit line would remain open as the account was paid down. Thus, if the initial ""credit line"" was $500 to cover the outstanding debt and service fee, as the balance were paid down and/or off, the credit limit could be decreased so as to prevent it from being used for new purchases. Obviously, I shredded the ""offer"" package as I did not owe the initial debt. I wonder how many people will consider this a relief of some type and agree to the ""offer.""  "	1

Just one sentence: I think the magic word is simply leveling. The magic word is simply, if everybody is doing equally well everywhere, then we don't have the problem anymore. That's it. And we simply have to work on that, at least try to get it right in Europe. And otherwise help as much as possible. Because I think that the EU and Europe are incredibly generous anyway, because if we look around a bit, and be it Australia or be it America, yes: They are building walls against Mexico; big fat ones, hundreds of kilometers long, yes? Against the immigrants. Or just what you have to bring for a deposit in Australia, yes? You have to put down a lot of money to even be allowed to stay. And I think the EU is, as far as it is possible, very very very generous and humane. But still: Level equality: Make sure that everyone is equally well off. From.	0
The allowance of amendments isn't the problem in the US political system. Amendments play a valuable role in legislation, and they can improve many laws. The problem is that the politicians involved choose to include unrelated things and their peers don't vote that shit down as stupid and unrelated. Congress doesn't need to pass bills that are hundreds of pages long that none of the reps have read before they vote. They don't need to accept amendments that aren't germane to the issue. They are making a choice to validate this behavior and to make laws in this way. It's not the fault of the process. It's the fault of the people involved in it, and it's the fault of voters for putting up with that shit for years and years.	0
"I think religious people are incapable of logical thought, CMV I am a climatologist and since I started my job at USDA about a year ago, I've run into two types of people who make my life a living hell: * There are government employees from federal and state agencies who deny climate change because ""man doesn't have that much control over god's creations"". * Even worse, there are some who say they simply don't care what happens on earth because it's only ""the first step"" of their eternal lives. They plan on being dead and in heaven, and whatever happens here on Earth is inconsequential. When I run into kinds of colleagues, I try to explain to them the science of what's happening. However, their responses ultimately lead them to some sort of anomalous thought patterns where their logic clearly breaks down, and science doesn't matter. **I believe religious people at some point in their thought processes are not capable of logic, or choose to believe things their scientific minds tell them is clearly false.** **CMV.**"	1
I'm going to speak slowly. And I'm speaking slowly, without coming up with new theses, but concrete examples of what we can do to solve the problem. Contingency. I'm sure that's been rightly said. Germany is safe in terms of legal immigration and recruitment of workers, that's one example: Before Italians, 50s. Then in the mass from 68 Turks. But now a concrete example of quota system. I gave the ridiculous example of asparagus harvesting. We have had about 200000 Korean nurses. Because in our health care system in nursing that didn't go well. Or from India. Look around, I hope they are all healthy, but of course we have well-trained nurses and geriatric nurses now, because the German society and the other societies are now getting so old that we can no longer recreate the young people at all, can produce, to be able to care for the old. So that's an example of contingency. In the construction industry, they used to have quotas before they joined the EU. The Portuguese, too, are now simply freelancers. With the Poles, a country of 38 million, it's more of a mass problem, because the labor market shows that I'm about to renovate a house. The black working Pole gets on the German market, who knows? Eight euros with us. Eight euros is a lot. He only has to pay eight sixty euros, to be concrete, he only has to pay eight sixty euros - I talked to employers who hire Poles yesterday - eight sixty euros he has to pay in taxes, he writes twenty hours officially for the German legislation and does double moonlighting, comes to his account. Yes, it is then nevertheless a giving and taking. Now nevertheless still another thesis: absolute closing would be beautiful. Folding in the castle, the drawbridge over Gibraltar, but we can't do that in Europe.	0
I would say it's impossible to create laws that are rigid enough, it's useless. So the asylum in the churches, so we also did that at some point because the law wanted it but in the end, the family, they stay here and they have passports again and so they can go back to legality. As far as the illegals are concerned, in fact nobody really dares to do anything because there are also groups behind them, so passports are bought, transport tickets are sold, so who really dares to intervene in these areas? Because there is a whole mafia behind it and the mafia is behind it, it is everywhere, so in every product that we buy we actually pay a contribution to the mafia. It's quite simple. And so these illegals, and especially these human traffics, especially with women, are obviously a very profitable business and I want to see the first one who really dares to intervene. Because officially we can't do much, so the churches are working in the shadows and maybe we can do something, but then we'll have to have more financial means and then we have half a job and then it's reduced to a quarter job and then another ten volunteers who work, but that's the reality and that's where we have to act. I don't know how we can do it. Thank you anyway.	0
"I was flat out lied to by the attorney for a credit card company who brought a small claims suit against me. I disputed the debt (and still do even after they garnished my wages but they intimidated me into a payment arrangement then lied to me and said there was no court date anymore since I ""settled"". I was skeptical and called the clerk of court's office only to find out they lied and I did need to show up. I showed up for the court date, even as I argued that this court had no jurisdiction over me because I never lived in that county but no-one even the clerk's office would listen to me and I was denied the right to go before a judge. I was only given an opportunity to talk to the attorney for the credit card company and sign papers saying we had a payment arrangement. Long story short, I made 1 of 2 payments then lost my job. I called them immediately to tell them I would make the 2nd and final payment 2-3 weeks late because I had to wait for a final check. They told me okay, but unbeknownst to me,they went back to court without me and got a default judgement for $1600 on what would have been a $709 payment. iI never got notice of the court hearing nor did I ever get a copy of the judgement. I didn't find out about it until I got a wage garnishment notice from my new employer 2 1/2 years later....VERY humiliating! My employer got the wage garnishment notice a week before I did so I couldn't even dispute it before my employer was involved. Second, I called the clerk of court's office in that county (3 hours from my home) and argued that you can't go to court without giving me a chance to defend myself and I shouldn't be forced to drive 3 hours each way to a county I never lived in. I was told by the clerk's office that they can file it wherever they want and I have to show up. I asked ""So if they wanted to file this in California to be jerks you're telling me I'd have to get on a plane and fly to California to defend a $709 lawsuit"""" She said ""Yes."" THAT HAS TO CHANGE.  "	1
Owing to the inherently non-private nature of the internet, NOTHING should be sent electronically. There is absolutely nothing wrong with continuing the use of the US Mail. However, the consumer should be free to allow the use of specific electronic communications, if they deem it proper. However, that should be specific; so that a collector cannot use Facebook, twitter, etc; only the specified means.  	0
"From what I've heard, the internet hate comes from the sole truth that they sound just like any other alternative/pop/rock group you hear on the radio. In other words, they're not particularly unique, and there is little complexity behind their music. While this itself doesn't spark hate, the overwhelming popularity of such a simple band that sounds virtually the same as many other bands in the genre just tends to anger a lot of people. Personally, I don't hate Nickelback. I can tolerate their music, it's not god-awful...but it's just irritating how they get more attention than bands in the genre that are far superior . This seems to be how it started. Of course, the trendy ""it's cool to hate Nickleback"" just fans the flames. (I posted this in another subreddit some time ago)"	1
my in-laws had the same issue with BoA. They paid their mortgate EARLY every month and still were reported as late every month. This is tragic and ruined their credit. When these things happen it takes years for the credit to br repaired even though a collector reported the information falsely, incurracately, and repeatedly. BoA should be penalized HEAVILY for these infractions otherwise they just ignore consumers.  	1
I'm listening. We learn every day. We learn from each other, that's normal. But I think the problem is much more complex, my friends. In relation to everything we've just said. Because we all try to improve our standard of living, to have better, the Portuguese since the 60s, from the 50s, have immigrated illegally too. We crossed, jumped borders, not necessarily legally, illegally for - after the Second World War. It was complicated, it was a country...	1
In that case, it doesn't make any sense at all to give someone a three-month visa, because the person earns money in Germany, spends it in Poland, then comes back and gets another tourist visa; that is, that person can never settle permanently in Germany, because they don't earn enough money to stay there, so they spend their money in Poland, and that means for Germany it doesn't do anything either.	0
I have been a frequent target of debt collectors and their phone calls for several years. The reason, clearly, is because I have a common last name. I do not have any debts. First, once a debt collector starts calling me, it is extremely difficult to get rid of them. One outfit called me a liar and kept calling. Another went after me for two different people. Second, yes, a barrage of collection calls can be harmful. Dealing with debt collectors on a daily basis has taken its toll on my physical and mental health. I'm an old lady. It has also made me paranoid about my own finances.  	1
Illegal immigrants, those who are from the former great Hungary - but those who came from the Far East for example the Chinese, their initial intention was not to stay in Hungary but they considered our country of a country to be able to continue a journey to the west. So it was not their intention to stay in Hungary. We have three stations in Hungary where they - but of course they are arrested at the border. Because they are arrested, they are in jail, so in Békéscsaba we have - it's a city in Hungary where there are a lot of Chinese, a lot of illegal immigrants are arrested, between 100 and 200 people and we examine, if they can be granted refugee status so they can stay in the country or not. In the past there were crossings through the green border, but nowadays the border can be countered so much, when it is a group, they are caught, they are - either they are turned back, in general, or they are put in jail. What I would like to say is that those who come from Africa - for example, we have very famous comedians who come from Africa, from Nigeria or from another African country, who sing - they are very appreciated. So these are people who are well liked because they are artists, we have an Indian who leads a program on television or radio. But the other such big problem in Hungary - not only in our country the big problem, is the problem of the gypsies. But this is a problem that we generally don't like to deal with. That's how if someone swims, we see the swimmer, but what is underneath this problem that concerns the gypsies, because it takes up a very large percentage in Hungary, we don't deal with a problem in depth.	1
The problem of the EU, apart from immigration, is the European constitution. It was thought from the beginning that the European constitution would be approved by everybody. By all the countries. And the no from France and the Dutch and then from Ireland was a real blow. Because all that we would get, this wonderful constitution, which was already so difficult to set up and work out, that really also cost us very dearly. And that has hindered the whole European development. And if we don't want to have, for example, the failure, then we have to give up some things and re-set the priorities. And the sovereignty, this upper, so you have to transfer some things to the EU. For example, this whole issue of immigration.	0

I think now I prefer to listen. For the moment, I prefer to listen to the opinions of others. I think that for everyone there is always a story that comes from the Bible. The one who is right, Solomon who was right. Everyone has some part of the truth. Personally I tend to agree with Pedro. I hope I didn't make a mistake in the name. Because I consider the immigrants more or less good. They are used by us and it's okay for us to be like that. I don't know if it's right. It's true that many times we forget to put packaging, because there are people who have hope for life in our country. From the moment we cut off this hope of life, I don't know if we have the right to do that or not. [1 :	0
If I understand right what Gerard said, is that he shared an opinion that one cannot impose on the other country, how to develop, chose a democracy. However, I think that when we sign a certain agreement, which is a binding offer, we can have requirements. Especially when we give a financial support for this country. We can have predispositions and support some sort of trends, tendencies. Democracy may not be the best solution, however, neither the worst one as well.   	0
While not specifically addressed in this website, the current punishment for violations of the FDCPA are practically teethless. 100 is of little consequence to most companies.

Any form of written communication should count as a notice in writing. If a debt collector receives a notice via email of contact they should be required to follow it.  	0

These people that are looking for a job and that do not find any in one of the EU countries do not depend on this country[?]. If certain person did not find a job in the EU country, he prefers to live in poverty, but in the EU because he is still better off than in the country where this person has been living before. If you have someone who has always lived in misery, even when this person has no work, it is not the slightest importance for him/her. If here is no work for this person and there, he/she did not have any as well, so here, he/she is anyway better off when he stays. I'm not saying that this person should get an apartment and have access to everything but still get a chance. Create any right for such people in the market which should be open for all and surely give such opportunities. Maybe this person will find work and employers should have the right to hire such a person if it has the appropriate qualifications.	0
Regarding illegality, I just wanted to ask is there a way in France to determine the number of illegal people and if there isn't, so if we don't know how many there are, how do we want to solve the problem if we don't know what it is concretely? So we would have to, as we just know, not at this point, so that - but obviously it's that these illegals can hardly be counted, that's also a starting problem.	0
Suspend further action to collect or re-sell.

As Director I can clearly in good faith state that as we service our potential losses and my Team make collection calls contact is generally made at work place as well. Let me also state that many of the call backs are made from Members at work as well. It all depends on the employer and the work conditions surrounding the consumer.  	1
1:16.46] Yes, for what Mr. Paul is saying, how is it that... well, we are at the ends of the continent, but in fact we are close relatives because we are all Latins, so you are quite right; each state should have its own opinion, should have its own autonomy, and I have the impression that we understand each other, because we are relatives, almost blood relatives. Because in Romanian we have a word that is (naos?), which is almost the same as in Romanian [?] So it's true, I agree, each state should regulate its immigration policy. So regulate the criteria, establish them because we are each a state in ourselves in the Union. And maybe you referred to a package of laws that exists now at that time. In Portugal, do you have a law in the Portuguese parliament that manages immigration from third countries into the European Union or not? [1 :	0

The enforcement mechanism of the FDCPA is laughable from the point of view of the debtor. For example, a debt collector said that since they are out of the country they are not required to adhere to the FDCPA. Luckily, I knew better, but most folk don't. The CFPB's voluntary reporting combined with proxy enforcement power may curb the industry's activities, and may be cheaper and faster than class action lawsuits.  	1
Possibly also the same wages.   I believe, without doubt, that it would suit our Polish friends, precisely, the same wages. The Dutch would rather lose in this solution. Well good, but I have a feeling, that if we would go this way, in the direction of that possible solution, there are certain traps how to get around this. If we have had the same language for example, the problems would be solved. However, we are all aware that it is not that simple. It definitely will not function. 	0
[43: [47] France has a great history of immigration, ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... and I think it's a little bit everywhere in Europe too, we've become more selective but the problem that we said Madame, is I think more illegal immigration because there we have trouble knowing who comes in and who doesn't, these illegals so have hidden, it's difficult to have figures, and it's this immigration that is difficult to control, that we must - I think - accentuate at the level to limit it.	0
My experience has been that people younger than I (a boomer) prefer to communicate electronically (emails, texts & chats). I know that when I was deeply in debt, I would have preferred not to have to speak to a real person. There is a legitimate concern about unencrypted email or the potential for consumers not to consider that others may have access to their email. However, in general, we should encourage communication, however that happens - especially if it is in a form preferred by a particular consumer. I believe that emails, chats & texts should all be considered writings. I don't know how you include all disclosures unless you direct someone to a place where they can read them in plain english.  	0
"[CMV] I think that life is not a journey, the only thing that matters is how much success you have in your life. The only thing I care about in life is the end result. I don't want to fail at something a million times to ""learn"" to do something, I want success now. Each one of those failures only discourages me from trying harder. I can't enjoy failing like some people can. I'm sorry, but my drawings look like garbage, not a stepping stone to a greater me. And don't get me started with my success rate with women. In short, the only thing I really enjoy in life is success. Failure is discomforting, painful, and only serves to remind me of how bad my skills are. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, CMV."	0
So, a teacher in Poland can even earn more than it is usual in Germany. He even knows that he can get more and how much more he can get in Poland; in this respect, the work is of course much more profitable for him than in Germany, because the exchange rate of the zloty to the euro alone is still very low. But in the opposite direction this could not work, because a German teacher would of course not want to work in Poland, even if the external circumstances and the working conditions would be exactly the same, so the same money probably also for lawyers or doctors - well, for lawyers, I don't know, this is perhaps not a very well chosen example. But, let's stay with doctors, it's true that it's particularly difficult to set up in Poland. We have excellently trained doctors, but a young doctor at the beginning of his career earns almost nothing, i.e. 800 zloty, which is very little, and surgeons who are excellent, for my sake, and who also work in a clinic and have had to learn for years and have invested themselves, are still paid inadequately - so this is really a very serious problem in Poland and therefore it is also very difficult to find an appropriate solution. But maybe my colleagues would like to add something, because someone who has had a vocational training and who, because of me, then leaves Poland to work in Germany, for example in the construction industry, and then stays in Germany for three or four years, then comes back to Poland - in the meantime he has become a skilled worker - and I also know an example for whom this, what I just said, applies; from the construction industry.	1
The problem of skilled workers does not only concern - I cannot say anything about doctors because I am a technician - but I know from many years of experience - at least 25 years is that technical or engineering sciences are missing at all and nothing has really changed. At that time it was said that physics and mathematics and chemistry are no longer administered in high schools; you can buy yourself free of that, no 'deselect' is what I think it's called. And that's why you can't study engineering if you don't have these really good subjects - and that's our problem, that I think it's already done wrong in school.	1
"A bunch of rental services (cars, vacation venues, etc) require the person making the reservation to be at least 25. After that, the decades are generally considered milestones. 30 is when you're ""omg so old"". 40 is when you can start being sad about being ""old"". 50 is when you stop feeling bad about being ""old"". 65 is retirement. 90 is when people start writing newspaper blurbs about your birthday and you start competing for oldest guy in the city."	0
"If you're going to follow that logic through you wind up restricting so many things that you might as well argue for universal state run orphanages. How would you even track this? Fingerprinting at the pull of every slot machine. I'd also like to point out that you don't know any families destroyed by gambling. You know families destroyed by family members. Here is a compromise play. Have some kind legal system set up where it is actually really easy to initiate proceedings to have someone declared unfit to handle their finances and a guardianship is initiated. Things like detrimental gambling habit and alcoholism would be the kind of thing that one would have to prove for a loved one. Once that is done make it so that that guardian can have that person put on a ""no play"" list on file at the casino. &gt;I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp; money. It is quite dangerous to advocate wielding the violence of the state just because activities among adults pisses you off and you think they could do better things with their time and money. Much better to devise a system where the percentage with some sort of addiction disorder can be locked out of the activity and taken care of."	0

Having a lesser punishment for attempted murder incentivizes would-be murderers in the middle of carrying out their plans from following through because they know the punishment will be greatly reduced if they restrain themselves in the very end and don't actually kill someone. Also attempted murder is a much harder crime to prove definitively than actual murder because it is difficult to definitively tell if someone was trying to kill a person or simply harm them. Both are bad but a less severe crime should have a less severe punishment and since it is less clear with attempted murder that the person wanted someone dead the punishment is less severe.	0

As one in a similar situation morally I feel similarly, though my concerns are purely hedonistic! I love me some bacon. For your economic concerns i can try to change your view! Essentially when you go to a restaurant and order a salad, the restaurant may not notice, but you have made a decision eith your money. If you do that more (or more people do it) the average amount of meat the restaurant buys will drop (probably minutely, but over time the price of meat will go up because demand is going down). The same goes for the supermarket. If you buy meat, then the supermarket will continue to buy meet in the same quantity. If you do not, then while the effect might be small, it's small in the right direction and will push the quantity of meat demanded down! So while your individual impact is small, it can be small in the right direction or the wrong direction. I've decided to simply do the better thing, not the best thing, and eat less meat :p i just have such a strong taste for it that until eating vegetarian is a more affordable and *easy* solution, I wont be giving it up altogether!	1
"Someone who lived at my address, more than 30 years ago had a debt with Household Finance. We get letters that we return ""Addressee Unknown"" and phone calls. Finally I called one number back and told them that the person they looked for wasn't there. That law firm stopped robo-calling but a few months later a new one started up. Records should convey when debts are sold from collection agency to collection agency. Why should I have to go through all that a second time? I also think debt collectors should be prohibited from using the address to get a phone number after 2 years. This debt was more than 30 years old why do they think anyone who knew here would still live there? I googled the woman's name. I found out on the first search that she lives about 10 miles from here. If I can find her that easily why can't a debt collector, who stands to gain something, be bothered to do a little research?

yes, to join what Sören said and also in relation to the information that we have read here, on page 15 I saw something and so there it says, a development of a cooperation with the countries there to also develop democracy and the economy here, and so by not encouraging too strongly with that, so to emigrate at all. So I would say that the arguments for this are the best. Therefore, I also underline what Sören said. Yes, so there is a text here that says that the heads of state and government have created a common area of justice and freedom here and that you also have border control here... but three of the countries did not agree with that, so Denmark, Ireland and England. They wanted to get out of this legislation, for example, and you can see that also in the case of Great Britain. Great Britain is one of the member countries, which has to react in a certain way, because they have a big historical debt to their former colonial territories. And what you just said, Sören, we really have to come to an agreement here. So on the basis of these three examples, that becomes quite clear. And we also have to remind them of their responsibility. So what historical responsibility they carry.	0
A problem is that use of a condom is risk management, it doesn't remove risk. All the risks that are present without condoms are still present with them, just to a lesser extent. So, promiscuity is a potential health hazard, even with safe sex. Additionally, it's easy to wind up with different goals with sex partners, people who initially wanted no strings attached can wind up unintentionally attached. These things have a nasty tendency to explode socially, which makes them rather disruptive. It might work out just fine the vast majority of the time, but it only requires a couple of situations to end in shouting matches, broken friendships, feuds, or cases of stalking for the community to have a serious problem. A strong selection process can carefully manage these issues to the point where I would argue that someone could successfully do so an not be socially disruptive or a vector for disease. The problem is this is at loggerheads with the goal of having lots of sex, either one limits sex in one a variety of ways and reaches a balance with society at large or one does not limit sex and does provoke social pressure to do so. Guys who do likewise are also looked down upon, largely for the same reason. It's just not as pronounced because of a biased cultural inheritance. So it's not something all that gender specific.	0

You are not living in the real world if you think it is just so easy, RBell. No, most consumers are not lawyers. The people using these debt collection practices are deliberately abusing the law because they know most who are harassed and in debt and working people who probably can't afford a lawyer.

This question is most interesting with respect to student loans. Unlike most other debts, student loans have the potential to be greater than $75k, which means a consumer can be sued in Federal Court under supplemental jurisdiction provisions.

I will refer to the idea of equalizing the level of the economies of the countries outside the EU. Of course, the idea is very good. However, I think that the European community is not yet ready for this. Considering the financial terms, the community is gradually joined by countries, where an enormous difference of economic levels exists in comparison to the old members of EU. That is why, I think, that one should consider newly accepted countries, like for example Hungary or Romania, and I am not mentioning Poland, right? Thank you.	0
"Although I don't think that it is necessary for the CFPB to have undercover agents, I do think that the CFPB should create a new class of examiners. Currently the CFPB examiners only do examinations of the financial lenders and nonbank lenders. But since the CFPB is now taking on the collection industry, the CFPB should create a new classification of examiners to do onsite examinations of the debt collection companies. This would not create any harm to the CFPB nor would it impact the CFPB""s budget or operations. The CFPB""s budget is not allocated through congressional legislation "" it is allocated through monetary transfers from the Federal Reserve. All the CFPB would need to do is ask for additional transfers from the Federal Reserve to create this new classification of examiners. These new examiners would help the CFPB monitor the debt collection industry and would help stimulate the economy by adding more jobs. This is a win-win solution.  "	0
Creditors should be entitled to require consumers to provide them with a contact address and phone number and to provide updates while debts are outstanding. If consumers do not do so, it should be fair for creditors (and collectors) to skip-trace or to reach them at other numbers. Collectors should not be allowed to make calls to work until they have made multiple attempts to contact a consumer at home.  	0
"[Qualia]( Qualia are the highlights of conscious experience. The *experience* of the color red. The *pain* of a cut. The *sound* of a crash. I know that I *experience* these things. When I pinch my arm, my nervous system carries a signal to my brain that notifies it of the stimulus. But there is something additional: an actual experience of the pain. This experience is a quale. The philosopher David Chalmers has a thought-experiment that really highlights this, involving what he calls [philosophical zombies]( In short, imagine a world just like our own, down to every last quark and gluon. When you pinch me, I say ""Ow!"". I can sit and watch a sunset, and remark that the sky is purple. But unlike our world, in this new world I never actually *experience* anything. This seems totally possible. After all, reacting to a pinch only requires the transmission of the stimulus to the brain, not a conscious experience. So his argument is this: Let's suppose that the physical description of our world accounts for everything. This view is called *physicalism*, and though you didn't explicitly endorse it in your post, it is quite likely similar to the opinion you seem to hold. [Wikipedia]( has a more thorough form of the argument, if you are interested. So now we have two worlds that are physically identical, down to every last detail. But in one world, we have conscious experience, and in the other we don't. So it cannot possibly be that the physical description of the world accounts for everything in it: for one, it doesn't account for consciousness. Thus physicalism must be false. This argument is logically valid, but some people take issue with some of the premises. For one, it is possible that a complete physical description of the world *would* account for consciousness, therefore it would be logically impossible for an exact physical clone of our universe to be missing conscious experience. Much has been written about this specific argument, both in favor and in opposition. I'd like to return, though, to qualia. Any worldview has to account for qualia. For entirely physical worldviews, this means that qualia ultimately are physical. There are some famous arguments, however, that try and show that this cannot be so. One such is the [knowledge argument]( Here is one form by Frank Jackson: &gt; Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like ‘red’, ‘blue’, and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ‘The sky is blue’. [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not? One might say that she *does* learn something: what the actual experience of the color blue is. Therefore, since she had a complete physical knowledge of the color blue, but still learned something about blue: she learned something non-physical. So, back to souls. Does any of this offer any support for the classicial notion of a soul, where after one dies he goes to heaven to spend eternity with Grandma and Grandpa, swimming in rivers of milk and honey? Of course not. It doesn't even say much about personal identity. These arguments only support the notion that our conscious experience cannot be fully explained by a physicalist worldview. I've quoted Schrodinger in another reply, because he was such a colorful guy, and I'll conclude with another quote of his: &gt; The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so. Personally, as a philosophical lay-person, I'm swayed by these arguments. I have read many counters to them, but none of them have particularly resonated with me. On the other hand, I can imagine someone coming to the opposite conclusion: that all of the talk about qualia and philsophical zombies amounts to sweeping what we don't quite understand under a rug and calling it magic. I hope, however, that I've shown that there is something of a debate to be had about consciousness. This debate has very little to say about what we would normally call a ""soul"", but if we water-down the definition to basically mean ""something apart from our physical brain"", then one might be able to make a case."	1
I think that first of all, employers are aware which professions are needed, nonetheless, still, it should be accepted by the government of a given country. Thank you.	0
It seems that just about anyone can create a debt collection company and if the owners and/or employees have unscrupulous desires, then it seems that privacy is a big concern. Plus, if anyone can create/own debt collection companies, then it doesn't seem to surprise me why so many debt collecting companies break the laws. There should be tighter laws on the formation of debt collection companies and the employees that they can hire.  	0
That's a good question, but I think that's something that should be discussed, for example, how to prevent piracy of ships that have been grounded because these countries have been bled dry. Yes? The developed countries have taken all the raw materials, taken their livelihoods and ...they're shaking their heads?	0
I would just like to throw out an element, which is that we had this situation of the walls et cetera, the barbed wire et cetera and so thankfully it's gone. It's gone and so it would not be right for Europe to start using walls and barbed wire again. So we absolutely have to find another solution.	1
I would like to add one thing about aid to countries that I share, that this aid must be developed. I think that today it is one percent of the gross product of the richest countries, but the problem with this aid that has been poured out for 20 years is that it is astronomical and that money has disappeared somewhere. Those who are a little bit interested, they can find personalities so rich that they can't believe it and this aid doesn't change anything. It must be done, even if the money is not [...]. Second aspect of this story: students who come to study in countries like Germany, like France, like England, especially in African countries, 99 percent of these students never return to their countries of origin, never. They stay. So how can these countries develop? By developing corruption, and that I add, is that you said Sir, that the multinationals corrupt, yes. But there are incredible corruptors. A corrupter is a president in a country. So we can say that they corrupt, but there is a guy, who asks for a few billion, he takes it. So, the situation is extremely difficult because this money is never controlled, this money enters the African countries, you can check it, it is difficult to find, but the problem is that this money disappeared somewhere. The last example I can add is Algeria: Algeria is a country that should be the richest in the world. It is a country that has the cleanest gas, the cleanest oil of humanity - but it is a country that is poorer. I'll let you answer the question why.	1
When we did it, it was agreed that any 3rd party communication outside SOL at any point was a potential violation of the FDCPA. Since 3rd party debt collectors are required to be truthful at all times, they cannot say 'we are attempting to collect a debt' if they are time-barred from collecting the debt. We were the meanest, nastiest, most aggressive in the multi-state area at that time, and this was the stance. Suggestion is clarify that time-barred debts are time-barred for the 3rd party as well, and cannot be collected, attempted to be collected, or bought/sold.  	1
Interesting. Well legally the penalty for anything that does actual harm is much more severe, for example DUI vs impaired driving causing death. But you present an interesting case. If I were a judge, I would justify the position by saying it's impossible to tell just how dead set a person was on killing another. It's entirely possible that something within you made the conscious decision at the last second to tilt your gun a little too high, and miss him. I believe that the Law would like to assume that nobody is inherently evil and that the difference between a failed murder and a successful one is one of character and restraint. Of course this isn't always the case, but you can see that when sentencing, a justice would prefer to have mercy on someone who went into that house intending to kill a man, but decided not to when push came to shove.	0
I agree with this idea. Who is against this idea? Why? Because otherwise people will go en masse to another country. All of a sudden, in the Netherlands we have stricter immigration rules, well, at that moment, people will go to another country and we will have a very illegal distribution. I think we need a European agreement about what we want, what we consider desirable in terms of immigration. And the member countries must submit to this policy.	0
Yes, so I think it's not that simple. I think it has to be a mix of all systems. Because you can't just take away the bright minds and the academics from other countries, can you? They're needed there, too, aren't they? Then I would lower the standard in those countries again. It's very pleasant to pick out the goodies from a country and say that only they are allowed in, right? The next question is the Lisbon Treaty. Not all EU countries have signed it yet, right? And the big question is, if we sign the Treaty of Lisbon, then a majority of the EU countries can decide on such a question; if we don't sign it, then it will always have to be unanimous. So unanimous, 27 countries, as we know anyway, is incredibly difficult, yes? And the big question is still Turkey. Because there is an overlap between legal and illegal immigration, yes? Turkey wants to join the EU. Is that still Europe? What comes next? Does Israel also want to join the EU? Where do we make the borders? Where does it end, where does it start, yes? Big question. If you take Turkey in now, do the Turks prefer to stay at home if you help Turkey economically, EU-wise. Or do we get even more Turks in Europe, who are an insane burden on us. Because finally Berlin Kreuzberg - I thought it was the third largest Turkish city, but I heard just now that it was already the second largest Turkish city. And that's in Berlin then, right? And not in Turkey. Brings enormous problems with it. And I don't think you can lump the different needs of the countries together under one EU umbrella. Lithuania will need other immigrants like Spaniards, yes? This also has to do with the corresponding national economy there. I only know that Austria is very strict at the moment and that a friend of mine has fallen in love with a Tunisian whom she also wants to marry. And Austria does not even give a visit visa for 14 days for a Tunisian: third country. Not even a visit visa, because they are afraid that he will stay there, illegally. They have become very strict. It shocked me, I have to say honestly. Because; how does that work? I can't even travel freely from Tunisia to Austria, can I? That's really bad, yes. And even if she would marry him, he doesn't automatically get the Austrian citizenship and he is not allowed to stay longer than one year and after one year he has to prove that he knows German and that he can support himself here. I can only say this in a non-judgmental way: these are Austrian laws at the moment. How the EU looks like, I do not know how it is in other countries - I can only assume my own. Ok, thank you.	1
I had a debt collector tell me they told me that if I'd make a payment right then they'd make a payment plan. This was an Amercian Express collector. Once I made the payment they said they're supervisor would have to approve it and they weren't there. But that she would call back at 7pm MST to make the arrangement. Needless to say no one called back and American Express would not make arrangements with me because they said I was able to pay that amount so I shouldn't need arrangements. I was so dumbfounded by the collection practices of American Express. It was from their internal collections department.  	1
So in Spain, it is considered that he has more facilities, that he naturally has more possibilities to go from the (...), a family of immigrants who come from Senegal or Nigeria. And so we consider that these people need more help but indeed, we do not understand this situation.	0
Yes, I totally agree with the compatriots in the sense that - because I see that you always come back to what can Europe do and what can Europe do. Me I think that to come back - .	1
I believe that the band Nickelback gets far too much unwarranted hate. CMV. I'm not a huge Nickelback fan in anyway, but I do listen to a few of their singles (Rock Star, Lullaby) regularly. They are a solid group; they have won several Junos and have held up as a band for almost 2 decades - people are listening to their music and enjoying it. But as soon as I go on the internet, I am overcome by tons of people making fun of them, disliking their content on Youtube, and posting cancerous memes of various band members on sites like this and 9gag. Unless I'm missing something crucial in the band's history, like hate mongering or a history of white supremacy advocation, I see no reason for people to jump on a bandwagon and hate this band. Not only that but people make extremely untasteful remarks about Chad Kroeger's recent marriage to Avril Lavigne. Avril in no way deserves any of the criticism associated with Nickelback - it has only come to light because of their marriage.	1
Thank you. I don't want to push myself forward, but I also think that the EU is very important and challenged and the richer countries of the EU simply have to help those who have now joined us very quickly, such as Bulgaria and Romania, for example, yes? We have an increase in crime in Vienna, yes? It is so high, in the last month, I think, 30 percent more cars were stolen. Only in the last month, yes? And I understand the people. I mean, I wouldn't be happy if my car was gone either, but they come and see that there's so much of it here, right? And with them there is nothing left. And after communism, everything collapsed in these two countries, for example. And anyone who has been there will also see that agriculture no longer exists there. That used to be the granary of the Austrian monarchy, yes? And nothing exists anymore. The fields are lying fallow, they are becoming desolate. And at most, private households do a little bit for themselves in a tiny little garden, yes? But this is where the EU is really needed with programs, because we can use the things that are produced down there 100 percent. I don't need anything from South America, or I don't need fruit from South Africa, when I can have Bulgaria and Romania, yes? And I think Germany has been so efficient with the colonization, let's just say it, of the new federal states, yes? They have built up so much in no time at all. And they were also doing very badly, yes, when they opened up. And now 20 years later, it's exactly 20 years ago, it's a flourishing country, yes? And I think the entire EU should do the same with the other countries in the East. Takes time, also takes time, but [grins]. So, that's it again, sorry.	1
I would like to say something that completes what Jorge said. About the problem of the selectivity of immigrants, which I did not agree with earlier. You said that the people who want to immigrate to the EU are mainly those who already have an education. You asked why they would want to do that. Why would they want to immigrate if they already had an education? So, if they were already qualified. As long as they have higher education or not really higher education, but an education. They choose to come to an EU state they add value to that state. Why shouldn't they? My answer would be: in the case of Armenia for example, sometimes education or years of study or diplomas are not recognized at their true value. Or you can't find a job where you feel appreciated. And then you want to move to a better place. You can be an immigrant with a good education.	0
I have had several doctor/laboratory debts placed on my credit report. These are debts that I never rec'd a bill for or even a phone call from the hospital or facility. I have very good health insurance that paid over $14k when I had my baby... 3 months go by and I start getting notified by my credit monitoring agency that my credit score is going down. things such as a (pediatric audiology test $83) when my baby was 1 day old. apparently the audiologist doesnt bill through the hospital.... subsequently, they also dont bill the patients.. they outsource their billing to a 3rd party collection agency who immediately reports it to all 3 credit bureaus. Maybe i missed that forumn on this sight, A company can send a $100 bill to Transunion and say I owe it, and BAM...my credit score takes a 10 point dive. Agencies should not be able to put something on your credit report without first having not only validated the debt and provided any and all documents that prove you owe the debt, but they must be required to have attempted to collect the debt. I have had businesses tell em that its cheaper to put the bill directly on your credit report than it is to hire a 3rd party to collect the debt. This is a horrible injustice to the people who pay their bills, maintain health iunsurance and who will pay their outstanding debts. The system is set up to force the consumer to prove their innocence (if you will) verus the creditor proving they are owed a debt.  	1
Yes, first of all, I would like to answer Angel. To the construction sector, as I said. I said that immigration should not be regulated by employers. Well immigration should be controlled by the rules, but then they are not set by the employers, of course. What I meant I also read out of the document. I was talking about job offers and so, but I also said that [there] should be very strict control at the entry and exit. In the sense that workers arriving at a certain time, because there was a certain construction project or something. An interesting possibility also just was, but now in the crisis, they are unemployed. Also in the construction sector. And when they are unemployed and no longer have a job, they already want to be granted the next work permit. It will not be renewed now unless you can present a document certifying that you have a job as well. As I said, control at the beginning and at the end as well. Control also in the area of too low wages.	0
My opinion is also that each state would have to go their own way, of course. They also have the help and assistance of Europe but it is themselves, it is the country itself that should make a decision what to allow, what not to allow. Basically, the countries should help themselves and not rely only on the help of foreign countries.	1
I agree with MER. I have experience as a debtor, pro-bono attorney and debt collector. You can't expect collectors to be judge or jury. The cease communication right is meant to to force the collector to sue or go away.  	1
"Disclaimer: I generally agree with OP but am playing devil's advocate. The problem with this is that there is an (mostly Western) expectation of education and an underlying tone of progressionism. While there are some people who instinctively follow a ""scientific model"" throughout their life - hypothesis, testing, learning from experience - I would argue that the rate of people who do this is much higher among educated and Westernized people than, say, a farmer in Africa who did not have a chance at an education. Additionally, this idea promotes the concept that you are moving forward by gathering information. However, what about knowledge that cannot be gathered through empiricism? We shouldn't all have to become meth addicts, or know/observe meth addicts to how bad the drug can be to us. Can we not learn through parable? What if this information/experiment is more damaging to you than beneficial? What about your own subjective view that coats the whole experience? I'm going to go all Buddhist on you here and argue that the best way to know reality is to know yourself - through meditation, knowing your body, and self-analysis of any kind. By knowing yourself, you can remove yourself as much as possible from the equation of life (view your experiences with the knowledge that you feel X way because you are Y or feel Z) and have a more genuine, truthful view - that's reality: no self."	0
If a bank or loan company makes the installment loan and does collections itself, and the debt is not sold or turned over to a collection agency, then there is no reason for a notice to the consumers to recognize the debt. They have been making payments to the debt collector for months and already know about the debt. Besides, the lender has already sent several past due statements and a certified letter about the debt.  	0
"I would like to support my charming neighbor Ana with a historical example if I may. Before Poland was in the EU, the Polish migrant workers, in historical times in the Ruhr area, hundreds of thousands have settled there, the Konietkis and Schimanskis and so on. Then we need in Bavaria, for example, to bring in the asparagus harvest, not only in recent years Polish, that is, Eastern European migrant workers, who are now allowed as EU members legally - they come over, six weeks or on the construction, legally in the meantime as small craftsmen. Until 2004, they were needed as contingent workers, because the German - I'll put it crudely - welfare recipients can't spend ten hours a day pricking asparagus. In Spain, the problem is certainly much bigger, because it is not to be expected that the Maghreb or Morocco will belong to the EU at some point. I have [nothing against it] I am in favor of it. I want to say something about the core problem from my point of view. In Germany, that is not like before the Portuguese or the many Greeks. I would also like to say something personal there, something geographical, but it is of course the mass of Turks with the very special family post-migration laws. Turkey is not at the gates of the EU, the U.S. wants it mainly for strategic NATO reasons. Turkey will not join the EU anytime soon, but we have millions of Turkish citizens, most of whom are in the lower class. And if we have an economic crisis, then they are unemployed and then they cause us problems. And today I have already heard at the lunch table, the emotions went off so that I went a little bit aside in the park to relax, because there is of course scolded: ""In the big cities we have then 20 Turkish children in school who can not speak German and six Germans. Right? There we have the emotions, there we have the colossal problems and there of course the federal government must steer, that it also tries, before anything definite will be able to move on this complex, complicated EU level, we can't wait for it, we need, to say it abstractly positive, I am convinced, and there we have an identity, we need qualified workers, because we are declining in the population and do not use our resources fully at school, we need again and again qualified (..., ...), green card[? ], Indian programmers and so on. We need qualified immigration because the shrinking process of our highly developed civilization has to be intercepted a little bit and finally also brutally said again in the small circle, we need the Malora[?] who namely do the dirty work, dispose of the garbage and at BMW, largest plant in Landshut, there are the Turks. And the Turks also drive their BMW, a status symbol, but they hide their wives and often don't teach their children German properly. That's a problem, so we have to deal with it on a national level, I'm sticking to my thesis, we have to react nationally and I also have the hope that certain standards, namely humane standards, will be introduced. So what is not working? We can't sink the boat people between Africa and Malta, that's not possible, and I can't imagine a barrier in Gibraltar either. Ana maybe you can help me?"	1
Again, that we're kind of going in circles. We can discuss this for two hours, everyone comes back with more or less the same elements, so we have such laws, the laws eventually have to be changed and so for example if a policeman has to go and arrest a woman for example, does the policeman have to decide if he can or if he can't? If she is beautiful enough, if she has children, it doesn't work like that. So you have to create a base, you have to have clear criteria to have a platform, to have a base, to be able to act or it doesn't help.	0
So I also have a question: what does it mean that we should not employ foreigners? All of our specialists are going abroad so if we do not employ foreigners; who is going to work for us in our country?	0
If the consumer claims identity theft then the Debt collectors should be required to prove otherwise. The CRAs should be forbidden to report any debt that has been disputed as Identity theft unless they can provide court admissible proof that it is a valid debt. The CRAs should be held more accountable and heavily fined for reporting erroneous information. Their fines should be paid directly to the consumer for the countless hours they spend trying to fix their credit reports. The CRAs should be required to send a letter to the consumer's insurance companies, mortgage companies, and anyone else that charged the consumer a higher rate based on their erroneous credit score and find out how much their error costs the consumer. The sum of those added costs should be paid by the CRAs directly to the consumer in addition to the fines. The burden of proof should fall on the CRAs and the debt collectors, not the consumer.  	0
If that were true, we would expect similar levels of vitriol aimed at other media aimed at girls and women wouldn't we? And yet we don't see that level of criticism aimed at things like My Little Pony, which has a very vocal 'brony' community that watches it. And Legend of Korra, which stars a teenage girl and is set in a world that builds upon the one created in TLA, which was also filled with well written and developed female characters. Same with Orange is the New Black, which is almost entirely about women. If it was chiefly misogyny that was causing the hate for twilight, we would naturally assume that the misogyny fueling criticism of twilight would result in criticism of those other fictions. And it's because the examples I listed are all well written. Twilight is hated because it's poorly written and has had far too much success given how poorly written it is. The article you linked mentions movies that, in her opinion, are similarly bad with the target genders reversed like Cowboys and Aliens, but I don't think those are comparable. CnA for example, didn't do that well in theaters and was not the huge phenomenon that Twilight was, and while the premise was silly, the execution of the premise wasn't *that* bad. Meanwhile, Twilight started with a premise that could have worked, but it had terrible writing. It's not misogyny, it's that the more successful something is, the more intense the criticism of it will be if it's generally perceived to be stupid. Look at Cars and Car 2 by Pixar. Most people agree that they're some of Pixar's worst movies. (They're not terrible - they're just not as good) They get a disproportional amount of criticism though, because despite being some viewed as the worse in Pixar's selection, they are some of the most profitable, and people hate that. So they gets more criticism than they might deserve. Misogyny doesn't even factor in.	1
I do not agree completely with the friend from my country that this is profitability. About which profitability can we talk here about? This is simply exploitation not profitability. When immigrants come and work for much lower salaries than Polish people and can work much better. Finally, Polish people are leaving the country and are going abroad where they are working for much better money but of course this caused the system we have in Poland. We all know in which regime we had to live before, what we did and how it does look like at the moment. I do not know if this is profitability, I think it is just harming people which are coming and also want to work just like we in other EU-countries. Thank you.	0
"A dialer does none of the things to which you refer. A human takes a lists of calls that are deemed restricted to any of the criteria that you listed, and loads that list into the computer software that also holds a lists of all calls to be made. Then the list of restricted calls are ""scrubbed"" out of the automated dialer. This scrubbing process is akin to a human scratching out a phone number with a pen on a paper list. There are no measurable gains in consumer protection to which you refer. Calls are not recorded through the dialer. Dialers work in unison with the recording software. This recording software records manual phone calls just the same.  "	0
The open-source development environment is called ***Linux***. You have: - gcc: One of the best optimizing compilers in the world for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go, - Others: Industry-standard interpreters for Perl, Python, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang, and craptons of other stuff - vim, emacs: Extremely powerful, syntax-highlighted, macro-driven, customizable text editors with tens of thousands of modules, plugins, and guides and support for code tags, call trees, regular expressions, etc. etc. - gdb: A powerful debugger with deep support for analysis - grpof: A comprehensive general profiler with dozens of utilities to analyze the results - valgrind: A leading memory analysis framework with tools for categorizing memory issues, race conditions, stack corruption, and lots more - make: scriptable build system with completely open support for user commands, variables, conditionals, pattern substution, and so forth - autotools: utilities for automatically generating inputs for make AND for tailoring it to the system in question - grep: search through directories of text files and get results with line number and context - svn, git, mercurial, etc.: support for any reasonable version control That's just from the *command line*, and most of that stuff doesn't require installing anything. And this is *before you pay for anything*. I've been using vim for a few years (not that long by guru standards) and I'm easily 3-4x more productive in it than in a more traditional IDE-style editor. With ctags and similar tools I can use it to jump to a definition of any variable, function, or class, view a call tree or an object browser, or fold in sections of code that are in my way. If you've only used the relatively dumb editors in (even the latest versions of) Visual Studio, you have *absolutely no idea* how much more powerful a strong editor is. Yes, there's a learning curve, but for something that you're going to be doing every day for the rest of your life, it's not prohibitive. For other tasks, the standard (GNU) Linux command line has evolved over the course of twenty years to be one of the best text-processing tools in the world, due largely to the piping paradigm, the wide variety of text processing tools standard in the shell, and the ease and integration of things like Perl scripts. I manage a large C systems code base and it would be much, much harder without the tools Linux affords (and I have a lot of development experience in both MS and Linux environments). We'd be *years* behind.	1
"Disgusted by their antics, I will never vote Republican. CMV Aside from maybe dogcatcher, Republicans' political antics and many of their policy stances have disgusted me to the point where I can scarcely consider voting for them even a hypothetical option. * I consider the Shutdown and earlier budgetary show-downs to be exceedingly irresponsible of the Republicans, a party that likes to claim the mantle of responsibility. * I find it callous that the GOP claims the debt and reducing the size of government are the highest priority when their efforts directly hurt people already suffering in a period of slow job recovery. * The GOP's strong ties to the Religious Right are anathema to me. I am an atheist, and I support a scientifically informed view on public policy. Pushing things like prayer in schools, ""intelligent design,"" denying climate change, restrictive sexual mores, and the notion that the United States is a ""Christian nation"" turn me off. * I am not a fan of gun violence (okay, well, who could disagree with that?). I believe we can find reasonable safeguards to reduce the rate of gun violence and number of guns while preserving 2nd Amendment rights. I understand gun culture and hunting are a major part of the rural lifestyle in America, but in urban areas, we associate guns more with crime and murder. * The Republicans like to talk the talk about civil liberties, but I don't think John McCain or Mitt Romney would have done things much differently from Obama in regard to NSA surveillance and other aspects of security theater. * I think we spend too much on the military and rather that money be spent on a social welfare: infrastructure, education, research."	1
I think the cost of education needs to be reduced to a more reasonable amount or repayment plans need to be income based. As far as consumer protection, legal aid needs to be made available, affordable and effective, and consumers need to take time to really know their rights and stop complaining about harassment because that's a completely different cause of action than restitution.  	0
Actually, what we have just said more often - I can't see your name - Julian; Julian has already said that correctly: language, vocational training, income - and only in this way can you properly reintegrate these illegal people who come to us, because otherwise they remain social cases that only cost the respective state money, bring trouble and just yes - do not belong in the cycle. So the states have to take care of this and this is not a matter for the EU - possibly via a large directive. The states themselves have to make sure that the people who come in are integrated, among the things that Julian has already said. Otherwise it won't work. But what's interesting is that we all know that, but the politicians don't.	0
"As we all know, military jobs often require no physical activity at all. If a particular military job involves a great deal of physical activity, the standards will be much higher. In general though, they want healthy, disciplined, physically fit people to be in the military, and the requirements are meant to exclude people who are not those things. Generally speaking, a man requires a much lower level of health, discipline, and fitness in order to reach the womens' standards than a woman does. The standards are just a proxy for ""in shape,"" and are in no way intended as a test of functional ability other than in the absolute broadest sense."	0
It's a good question, but unfortunately the answer is (of course) complicated. Manually dialing phones slows down businesses and raises costs; Automated dialing has preventive measures built in that manually dialing does not. To expand on the first point, debt collectors are cost centers, meaning their primary goal is to minimize costs (i.e., delinquent monies). An automated dialing system allows for a much more efficient manner of calling delinquent account-holders. Representatives are able to review the account history and status while the system connects the call, so the rep can quickly engage the customer. If a customer has given their cell phone or home number to the lender knowing it may be used for future contact attempts, there is no difference to the customer if the call is executed through a computer or dialer on the keypad. To expand on the second point, automated dialing systems have a lot of built in controls that actually protect the consumer. People make mistakes, and so do collectors: Automated dialers can have filters in place that restrict calls to customers based on location, time of day, or even how many attempts have already been made. In addition, calls made through the dialer can all be recorded so if there is a problem with the representative, the customer can refer back to the recording and the truth will come out.  	0
Yeah, I mean, the problem of language integration is not just a problem of migrants outside the EU, it exists inside the EU as well. In Andalusia, on the coast, we have people who come from the EU and they also have a [...], a different kind of ghetto. You go to a bar there and you see a sailor, they all speak German or English or whatever. I'm not saying they can't but that's really a closed society. And that's exactly the same in other countries I mean. It's very hermetic, just as hermetic as the Muslims are when they're among themselves. So I think it's a question of time, eventually they will integrate, I guess, but we also have to invest something, I guess.	1
In relation to assimilation, in my opinion it is a problem which is dealt on a short term basis. In Holland and Belgium, when we talk about this issue, we look at those who came earlier: Austrians, Germans, Spanish people. There were many waves of immigration. Finally the assimilation had been completed, and there are no differences between us, thanks to, I don’t know, the course of history. I think that the current wave of immigration will also end with assimilation, after some time. I have no doubts about it, but not on short  term basis as Frauke suggests.	0
"I have a hard time believing that a debt collection company ""treat[s] EVERY dispute the same"" when debt collectors seem to blatantly disregard a dispute that has the appearance of being ""copied directly from the internet."" Consumer advocates are trying to educate consumers, debtors, and alleged debtors with information on how to handle debt collectors or how to handle their particular situation. We are try to give them relevant links to FDCPA, FCRA, HIPPA, and various form letters that can help them communicate with debt collectors. There is nothing wrong with form letters. But there is everything wrong with debt collectors disregaring certain letters just because they don't like that it came from a consumer advocate source. Debt collectors operating legally and with nothing to hide should never treat form letters as something to throw in the trash. You seem to be saying that debt collectors will only want to communicate with consumers who are misinformed and don't know what their rights are, rather than communicate with a consumer who knows the laws and the appropriate ways to address a letter of dispute.

If I could react right away. Because it was also the fact, you'll say that I [...], but. The fact that I'm Breton, that must play a role, because with regard to our regional language, France has some tales to sell, perhaps. And I know that the French, when they went to Africa in the 19th century, didn't pay much attention to the language of the countries where they lived. They never made much effort to learn Arabic or Berber. So we [...] what we want. So today we ask Algerians to speak French. They are mostly Arabs, but I would like to be a little mouse and go back 150 years to see how many pieds noirs in Algeria tried to speak Arabic to make themselves understood by the population. And who was at home the priori, in addition that. one would have almost approached to speak Arabic at home. Ah, I go that always remains sometimes ? I have the impression that France has some problems with languages. Well, that's my personal opinion.	1
"Sorry, but you *do* believe in a soul, and here's why. Imagine the world after your death. What do you see? You might imagine people at your funeral, or other people in the world going about their business after you've passed away. But here's the thing: you still imagined *yourself seeing it*. You imagined your consciousness, existing in a metaphysical state after your body had gone. Now, you could argue, ""But I imagined my *present* consciousness looking at *future* events!"" It doesn't matter. For a true materialist, imagining an overlap between your own perception and the absence of your body should be impossible, like asking a person to imagine being blind and seeing the color red. Your mind can't wrap itself around that concept. But your mind can easily wrap itself around the concept of your consciousness existing without your body. That's because deep down, you really believe that your consciousness is a *thing* in and of itself, not a process or a function of your physical form. And if you believe your consciousness is a separate thing, then you believe that your perception of the world comes from a metaphysical entity which could, in theory, survive the destruction of your physical body. In other words, a soul. Now, what you *don't* believe is that *other people* have souls. It's easy to imagine a world without other people. But you believe that you have one, because everything you imagine has to pass through the filter of your own perception, even the imagining of your own death."	0
"I don't think each individual has to shoulder the whole world, has to lift the whole world - we have a system. I think the system as such - although I always say individual cases can go differently - but the system as such, I'm convinced of that, and I think all of us sitting here, we're all fine; we have food, we have drink, we're warm, and we don't need to be afraid. We don't need to be afraid that somebody is going to attack us at night; we don't need to be afraid that our children are going to be killed; we are in a very safe country and I think those are values that we are starting to not appreciate here and that we should appreciate. And these are things where I just think, if we look outside the box, there are a lot of people who are much worse off than we are, so we can't come here and say, ""We'll make our own soup, we're doing fine, and we'll let the rest go."	0
For over 3 years I have been contacted by debt collectors for an alleged debt. I diligently send proof of payment and am ignored, and several months later a new firm sends the same letter re the same debt. The collector never responds, investigates or verifies the dispute. They should be forced to do so.  	1
I would subscribe to that exactly. It also shouldn't mean we don't have crime here, but I'm someone who always looks a little bit, in proportion; where do we live - and we're doing quite well there. We have the crime, but I don't think that the crime would change significantly - at least in the area where I come from; I come from quite a rural area, from quite a manageable area, you know each other, you know your neighbors and nationality is a secondary issue. From that point of view, I don't think that immigration would increase a crime rate, for example, or would change the situation here significantly at all.	1
"Animals don't have sex because they want to pass on their genes - they have sex because they want orgasms and the satisfaction of their instincts. Evolution has created these rewards as a mechanism to compel animals to reproduce in order to create a reason to pass on their genes. When I say animals, I can even include humans in that. After all, many people are ""accidents"" - children born only because their parents wanted to have sex, not because they felt a need to pass on their genes. Also, many children are born because their parents had an instinctual desire to have a child. These children were not born because their parents wanted to ensure that their genes were passed on, but because of inbuilt instinct developed by natural selection."	0
In Germany, I don't know how much unemployment benefit there is; so with us, 60% of the last wage is paid out as unemployment benefit. And at the end of the day, per year of contribution, you only get four months of unemployment benefits. So you have to have worked for two years to be entitled to unemployment benefits for 8 months. The average unemployment benefit at the moment is 500/600 Euros, which is hardly enough to keep a family alive. And then there is the so-called family assistance, which is probably a kind of social assistance for families, which is 400 euros, with which you can also not feed a family. So I don't see what incentive migrants should have to come to us. Sure, they are hungry, they are hungry mouths that come to us, that is clear. I have also had experiences with immigrants, with migrants. I have noticed that Africans are often much more solidary, much better people than we are. They are also much more grateful for help than many Europeans. And that's why we are not in a position to regulate or solve this whole situation. Of course, there are also clear economic advantages to working, namely if migrants also pay taxes and social security contributions, then they would also contribute to our society. Then they would also be recognized as equal citizens. Then they would not be in this position if they were allowed to work. They just have to be put in the same position, have to have the same conditions as all other employees. Of course, this is my personal experience, I'm not going to repeat here what I've been told, what I've learned through hearsay. I have experienced it myself, witnessed it myself. I have also seen how, for example, entrepreneurs who had committed abuse were dealt with, and, as I said, they were treated very well and, of course, also had the opportunity to seek legal support and so on. Of course, we have to try to really integrate the migrants, so that a ghetto of foreigners doesn't develop in every capital city, in every province, in every small town, yes? They must be really integrated, of course also with their customs and traditions, but of course not only with their customs and traditions, otherwise they will close themselves off, shut themselves in their community, in their ghetto. Because well, they immigrate out of need with all their misery and are of course also the first to suffer from this misery or new misery, what arises there and ghettoization.	1
You say that there is no way to know anything. But how can you know that, really? Couldn't you stumble across a way to know things some day? You can say that you know nothing at the moment, but to say that you never knew anything, or that you will never know anything, seems awfully overconfident. So, if there is no need for the situation to remain as it is, then searching for a way to change the situation may be valid. Also, we regularly make actions based on knowledge and logic (I need to eat, you need to eat), so even if you don't believe in logic, you had better act as if you do. A minor quibble: The logic of an argument is independent of the people speaking it. If an argument just popped out of the ether, that wouldn't make it any less valid than if it came out of a person.	0
Who would like to start? My name is Rainer, so in the field of immigration I think we should first ask ourselves what the group's point of view would be and then maybe we should also work in stages, that's a possibility in my opinion because it's a rather complex subject and so if I look at the totality of the documents and I've already made notes and so on, but it's still a rather complex subject and so in my opinion we should try to get closer. So I don't have a plan or a program yet but so in my opinion we'll have to try to look at the different aspects, I don't know if anyone could react; so what could be a procedure?	0

"By the time a file reaches litigation, the debtor has already received at least one prior opportunity to resolve the debt with the collector (the initial demand letter, which by law must inform the debtor of his/her right to challenge the veracity of the debt being pursued). By making default judgment more difficult, the CFPB would only be rewarding the debtors who choose to take no action to resolve their complaints. Furthermore, the CFPB arguably has no authority to impose new, more burdensome requirements upon litigants in state court fora. Doing so would constitute an admission that state court rules of civil procedure deny due process in other types of proceedings that are not granted the ""benefit"" of Federal oversight.  "	0
"Because of the people at the grassroots level, I would like to note that in Germany, for example, the ""Bild"" newspaper - I have nothing against the ""Bild"" newspaper personally - but I think it contributes a lot to the fact that perhaps a xenophobic image is created. For us Austrians, it's the Kronenzeitung that does that. But I think that these newspapers contribute significantly to the fact that it is difficult for foreigners to integrate, precisely because then resentment is quickly built up, which, if you read it every day, does not go away."	1
A collector's toll-free number is the ideal number to display on Caller ID, since it allows the call to be returned from anywhere without incurring long-distance charges. It also lets the recipient know right away that it is not a personal call and is probably not from a local company. I'd much rather see an 800 number than a spoofed local number for a company that is really 1000 miles away (or in India). This spoofing is clearly a false and deceptive practice that is barred by the FDCPA, but still it occasionally happens.  	0

Cyprien brought up a point. if the immigrants... I don't know if he started the intervention if we were talking about legal or illegal immigrants. So, what's really the difference between those two? The one that we work. So, if you are an illegal immigrant you don't have a work contract. But when you have a contract, do you see yourself at the end of your contract, there is the question of starving. In fact, there are people who come from countries where they used to go hungry. So they go from countries where they lose work. But the question is: here we go back to the social aspects. Would be that they are better here than in their countries of origin. I continue to touch in this point. So I want to emphasize this point because here we are talking about deficit figures, percentages etc., but we are forgetting people, forgetting people. And I find that we always forget the people. People are really the names, the numbers of the pieces of the gear. They are nothing.	0
I would like to add to this topic that in Wroclaw we can not see an extremely increased amount of immigrants. It is not like, for example in England or Germany, where you can easily noticed people with different national clothes on the streets or that we have plenty of multicultural shops. However, I noticed from my observations that not only seasonal workers are coming to Poland but also we are having a lot of different kind of programs for example family reunification program, which is in my opinion a such a great idea to reunification families which during the II World War had to leave the country and go to Kazakhstan or to other post Soviet Republics. Now they have a chance to come back to Poland. Usually it is the whole family, grandparents, parents, grandchildren, and children. I noticed that these people are working much better than Polish because of their life they had to handle before in the Republics was much more difficult and in Poland they can earn money for better future. Also, I haven’t noticed increased criminality because of the immigrants.  	0
I absolutely hate robocalls, especially those that repeat constantly and relentlessly. There are some people who shirk their responsibilities, but there are also those who simply do not have money to pay out a debt. People lose their jobs, get laid off, get sick and can't work, retire and try to make it from one month to the next on miniscule retirement benefits. There should be a regulation against robocalls, period. They should not be allowed. They are not necessary and only serve to harass people. It's a bullying tactic, in my opinion.  	0
I think that this must be some universal language, universally understood, because we are very much divided into so many countries that it would be necessary to choose the language. So I think when employers will have to decide about the languages I do not know if this is a good solution. Because when they will not need these employees anymore, then what? Send them back? Surely, these people live, receive benefits and when the employer would just one day release them and the government would have to pay benefits for them, so it would be a kind of cooperation. This selection must be conducted with the joint employers and governments. If you would put on the freedom of the markets, then employers who do not need them (immigrants=workers) will fire them someday. Who will have to deal with this problem? Society, we all, our governments?	0
I would like to ask you a question. When you are talking about the Muslim immigrants, are you scared of them? I would like to know what kind of reactions you have on them. What kind of feelings they raise inside of you? Muslims’ world it is a world which we do not know well. We do not know their habits, traditions. We all remember 11 of September, (ok I do not know to what it can lead) so what do you feel when you see somebody from the Islam religion, somebody who is dressed differently. What do you think about it? In my opinion, this is actually not a problem. Religion in the EU should not be a problem. However, when we are talking about the immigration, religion should not play an important role here. As far as I know, Muslims are people which can adapt themselves very well in the society and accept the conditions.	0
I believe that selective immigration is needed, as there are some countries where certain professions are necessary. I know for example, that Polish IT people are appreciated a lot and they are paid better in the wealthier countries of the old EU, as well as other professions. I would be in favour of selective immigration. Thank you.  	1

"You may find this site to be interesting: Also, from 17 year old to 17 year old, do not get your information on politics from your parents or TV stations. As great a guy as my dad is, he spouts complete rubbish when talking about politics and in particular, Obama. Since I've been following politics pretty closely for a while now, I've usually heard about the news he is talking about and usually from his end there's some sort of important misconstrued detail that makes Obama look evil. The worst of it all, my younger brothers get the impression that Obama is bad because they hear my dad complain about him. And the same shit goes on in my school with other kids. Last year, we had a school vote just to see what way our school would swing in the election (it was Republican, by the way) and when talking to many of my friends, they often said ""I'm voting for Romney... because my parents don't like Obama."" When I say why I like Obama, people often don't put up much argument. I feel like people just sort of support what their family wants them to support. It's like they agree with one side but vote for the other because they don't know what they're doing. I hear people say how abortion is so bad because it's ""killing a person,"" when they don't realize at all how simplified and nonsensical it is to use that as your argument. Or hear people who aren't even that religious make fun of gays because they know they should. Or hear people shout about how teachers should be paid as much as pro athletes without realizing how economics work in the slightest. Or hear people shout how all guns need to be banned because guns kill people, blah blah. Us highschool kids are great at making BS pseudo-logical arguments all the time. If your highschool friends agree with you, I doubt it hardly means much. Now I'm not saying Obama is some sort of god who is not allowed to be critiqued, he has most certainly fucked up (in particular, this second term), and I'm not saying Romney is some sort of shitbag that only politically uneducated support. I'm just saying that, especially in highschool, you tend to start listening to and understanding what your parents are saying about politics. And when you hear it from your parents, people whom you tend to trust greatly, you might just assume that it's true rather than looking into it and forming your own opinion... because they're your parents and they must know what's right, right? I'm also not saying you're one of those impressionable people, maybe you're just more republican, I don't know. But I know for a fact highschool kids tend to be notorious for taking sides in politics and not knowing why - other than the fact that their parents or someone said so. Sorry, kinda got off on a tangent. Sometimes I just need to make it clear because I often don't trust people my age with holding a well-thought-out political conversation. Anyways, yeah, look at that site and it lists a bunch of good shit Obama has done. He's no saint, but he sure as hell ain't as bad as you might perceive."	1
I would just like to say that if you look at the whole thing in Germany, that's all well and good with the language, but these parallel societies with the Muslims, that bothers me enormously in Germany. And if it goes on like this, I'm afraid that my grandchildren will get a headscarf. Yes! I see it that way! because they are so fanatical. All over the world! Just look at them! These fundamentalists. What are they doing for... so suicide bombers and everything... it really upsets me! That's right! Look at the German cities! Yes. Real parallel societies. There are whole districts that are dominated only by Turks.	1
"Consumers who ask for validation should receive just that: a validation that the agency has verified the balance due has some basis as alleged. Too often consumers categorize this process as requiring ""proof"" as taxguy does. This is not the function of the validation process. ""Proof"" is something that will occur in court (or not). No document will be enough ""proof"" for many consumers. That is why the court system exists.  "	0
The migrants, they come to Germany for economic reasons, and I think it would be better if they were supported in their country, because there is very little work here, right? We have a lot of unemployed. Perhaps we could take the example of Switzerland, where someone can immigrate if he has a job and then bring his family and relatives. Politically persecuted persons, on the other hand, would have to be verifiable. And there you can probably - you have to accept them if it is verifiable that they have been persecuted. Thank you.	1
I think we are talking about Europe, in general we cannot stop at the borders of Europe. We live on a planet in a globalized world and we cannot limit ourselves to welcoming those we need and leaving the others outside our borders. We cannot steal the fundamental basis, the basis of life of these people. So we cannot allow these people to come to us, knock on the door, we tell them: no.	0
I'm referring to the concern that was expressed to us. And there is a point that frightens me and that worries me. It is the fact that European citizens or world citizens are seen as numbers, as a number. We often talk about quotas, percentages, numbers, but let's not forget that we are referring to people, to human beings. And Florin said something that I understand, but I don't agree. When he talked about a selection of immigration. So, to accept a certain immigration on the basis of a level of education, of qualifications, it is a contradiction, that is to say. We accept a certain person, in the EU. Those who have better qualifications can already have a good life in their countries. To give an opportunity to this person who already has qualifications in their country to be able to travel to another country of destination to improve their life. Elsewhere, it is to improve the qualifications and especially to give a plus value to the country of destination. And a minus value in the country of departure. And this is bad because the country that abandons the person, obviously, loses a qualified person. [1 :	0

*Devil's Advicate* [Here]( is a link to Paul Feyerabend's *Against Method* in which he argues against the current model of the scientific method. I suggest starting on page 9 as it is most pertinent to what you're talking about. To summarize for the lazy/don't have time: Feyerabend argues that the scientific methodology is too constrictive to the pursuit of knowledge. Many great discoveries have been by accident or have ignored the scientific method to reach a goal. Additionally, you fail to realize that science is not merely a tool, but instead is influenced by human biases and expectations. Science education, for example, is taught outside the context of history (mostly, some teachers will throw in the context) and philosophy (i.e. metaphysics). Epistemology isn't taught when pursuing a science degree in the university unless the student branches out. And as [u/pezz29]( points out, how can you really know what you know if you don't understand what knowledge is? The scientific method is the best way of attaining knowledge we've got right now. But the same can be said about religion in the past, and look how ~~reddit~~ ~~scientists~~ some people view religion. TLDR: The scientific method is constrictive and doesn't account for many factors in its pursuit of knowledge or in how we educate, as well as other stuff i didn't go into.	0
First about the zero option, zero immigration, of course it's a dream, it's impossible. it doesn't exist and a person who is going to say that he is going to introduce zero immigration, it's impossible. On the other hand, it is possible to establish strict rules that can eventually make these migratory flows follow, and that can be done. As far as France is concerned, what is official - because in France there is no official accounting - so what we know is that every year between 250,000 and 300,000 people enter France - official.	0
In my opinion, we should differentiate between assimilation on the one hand, because everyone has his or hers roots. Something that is assigned. One can integrate in another society, but has it to be a complete assimilation? I think that within the EU, there are countries which have their own languages, traditions, cultures and I think that it should be maintained. However, it would be worth to cooperate within the EU and in order to do this, some issues need to be regulated on the European level. 	0
"So, we asked different questions. Patricia [PA] said, ""mutual respect is very very important. ""I think so. But at the end of the day, what do we want? Do we want these immigrants who went to France to become 100 percent French or the other way around? 54 percent of the Turkish people still have to learn more about language and I would like to know, for all the supporters, how it worked from the beginning of these waves of immigration. It is also said that the native population has a certain culture, which could be disturbed by this immigration or even foreign invasion. I find this a bit strong. And culture, language, history - it would be nice to be able to talk about all these things. So, if we already speak the same language to begin with, I am already very happy when I hear our national songs sung, whether in Norwegian or in French. And all this is destroyed. It's completely destroyed when you have made a good bouillabaisse and a pot of mix. Thank you."	1
I also think, free market economy I don't think is good. We have the social market economy here and it's been very successful. The problem is really when the borders - I'm a little bit afraid of that - when the borders are open, that we really get conditions like in America - supply and demand regulate the price - and that a family man has to have two jobs to be able to feed his family at all. We have a system here that works well and it's very very difficult; I think every person who comes here to Europe and is looking for a better life here, and when I look that in the eye, I can't say to anyone: Who am I to say that I'm fine because I was born here by chance and you're not allowed to be here. But I believe that if unrestricted immigration were possible, then the welfare state that we have here or that Europe also has will no longer be able to function. We have to find a solution where we can simply cover the social area, which also goes in the direction of what was asked earlier: Health insurance? Should everyone have health insurance? I have a clear 'yes' to that. The question is, how is something like that affordable and how can it be implemented. And I think it's just as difficult to say we're sorting: Who is good enough for us? Who is allowed to immigrate to a country? I don't like to presume to say this one may and that one may not. Everyone has the same rights. But we have again exactly the difficulty when people - people are commodities; labor capital, human capital; these are quite terrible words, but when there are too many people, then the individual becomes nothing and only the prices are pushed down and in the end there is nothing left for anybody.	0
I think that Obama has very little to do with the NSA/PRISM Scandal and should not be blamed. CMV Most people directly turn against Obama when it comes to PRISM. I feel like other people were much more involved. Everyone just blames everything on him when he barely has anything to do with anything. What about congress? There is a lot more people involved in politics than just the president; everyone always seems to forget that. Compared to congress, Obama doesn't have many options. Prism was signed during the Bush Administration and we never went against what they were doing. I apologize for my poor grammar. English is definitely not my first language.	0
I would like to add a little something to what we are saying. In any case, Europe already has different speeds. Those who are in the Schengen area, those who are not, those who are in the Euro zone, those who are not. We are convinced Europeans, maybe all of us around the table, so we want it to be something global. It's logical to think about it. But I don't think we can think in any other way than trying to make it global, or what?	1
In fact what is an illegal immigrant because for me there are as many immigrants, as many different situations as the individual and that's why between the three options that are proposed, like a selective regularization would be more interesting with defined criteria. I'll take a simple example: In France, someone who comes to work in France legally is given a residence permit, that's it for ten years, during these ten years he builds a job, he builds a family, he has children who are French, because he was born in France and at the end of the ten years, for [... ...] because the rules have sometimes changed during these ten years, they find themselves with an expired residence permit and he finds himself completely illegal and clandestine. What do we do with these people? Should we throw them out? I don't think so. So that's what's difficult, to find a solution that will solve the problem for everyone. And here is also something I wanted to add: we have the case of illegal work, especially people who exploit and mistreat men and women, who exploit these workers, who make money and I think that our states, our governments must focus on - I don't know - tracking down these people for these employers who are dangerous. And in this case, often these are jobs that are refused by people who are legal, so again, here's an opportunity for selective regularization.	1
Most people hate the public school system, but are very happy with their own local schools. It turns out that if you omit schools with high poverty rates, our schools are actually doing pretty well. That said, if you are ideologically opposed to the public school system, you are free to opt out. Every state in the U.S. allows homeschooling, although the requirements vary for each. People are beginning to predict that the higher education bubble will burst due to the skyrocketing college tuition rates and the explosion of free open courseware available, and that it's very possible that by the time your children are college-aged, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a college education may be largely obsolete. Progress is slow in our society, but it is getting better. The high school that my parents went to was not desegregated until their senior year. Now, any children that you ever have will never know what it's like to live in a world where only straight white men can be president of the U.S. I've watched many people in my parents' generation change their views on interracial marriage as their children and their friends' children married those of other races. The tide is turning the other way toward acceptance of homosexuality as well. Look at the worldwide outrage directed at Russia recently.	1
Indeed it would be necessary to counteract this immigration of the way Sasha spoke here. For example in Africa where a lot of money (milliards) has been donated and nothing came out because the money went to thieves. They got richer as individuals and it did not help the poorer. I think that we should not give those fish but rods for catching the fish. That is, means of production in order to learn to produce work and lift the level of his country. In Africa was given fish but had not been given a fish rod. Even in this crisis situation it is quite sad because, unfortunately, the matter is getting worse and nobody knows how it will be. Thank you.	1
Alternative one is the easiest to communicate and probably the easiest to understand. Accouting systems will vary from creditor to creditor and requirements beyond this would only become more cumbersome and costly for a creditor and more confusing for a consumer. I would not have the breakdown be different for different types of credit extended. Computers and brains all across America will start smoking.  	0
I think the problem of immigration, illegal immigration is really a very big one, in general. And I think you can only do something about it by changing something in the countries of origin, through appropriate development aid. I know that this will certainly only happen very slowly. But if I imagine that drinking water will become very scarce at some point due to drought catastrophes and so on, then illegal immigration will increase more and more towards the north, towards Europe.

...the other solution - I'll make it shorter - the other solution [is] extremely naive. Like some were multicultural, very many young years ago were very naive in Germany, have seen the enrichments, new cultures, have become more skeptical, so laisser-faire principle. Opening the borders, legalizing the illegals in spurts; that will not make sense in my opinion. To make it simple, in the well-prepared materials, there are two points that might be partially agreed upon already here in this small circle. We needed a considered immigration, a qualified immigration. For very well also selfish, economic reasons. We have to admit that, because pure altruism leads to one's own downfall possibly. That is possible. A selected [choice] of people we need, who are also capable of integration. To make it quite sweeping, we in the small Europe although 470 million rich, cannot possibly the poverty potential, the over potential of the third world, topic overpopulation, topic births - also with the climatic change. Nowhere a keyword, it besides the globalization of the problem a topic. After all, we have population growth in these countries, fourth world, they have a birth rate up to 25 percent to 25 if we hang at 1.4. Yes.	0
In the question that was asked in the file, in fact, we can realize that the European Community... I am heard there... in fact it asks itself the question on how to protect itself from immigration. Rarely it asks itself the question that it provokes directly the immigration by its own policy that is carried out for example in the African countries. For example by the arms world, by sponsoring certain political regimes which then cause immigration to us. What does the European Community do in order to avoid this immigration from those countries? How does it help those governments, for example, so that people who are often forced, not by choice, to leave their country? What does Europe do to prevent this phenomenon on the spot? Is the country taking relations with local governments in order to help on the spot or I don't know if I am right, if I expressed myself well, but what is Europe doing not just in the sense of protecting itself, but what is it doing there, on the spot, to avoid that immigration decreases for example. I don't know, if I was understood.	0
I believe reasonable will depend on the circumstance of the dispute and the type of debt. A formal checklist should be created for various scenarios and the analyst reviewing the dispute should be able to enter comments against the checklist which would be part of the eoscar transcript.  	0
"I have an opinion on this. Because I have [experienced] this in my work. The supply of legal and illegal people, was stimulated by the people of the country of origin. They are in fact real slave traders, who come to offer people who have false papers for example and sometimes these papers are so well imitated, and counterfeited, that as an employer, who doesn't know much, you can't even see the difference. You don't even notice. We have fines in the Netherlands. Huge fines, like 25,000 Euro for each person who is put to work illegally. And the authorities themselves still come to you through the ticket of one or another social plan, you have to go around the cars: ""Do you still need people? ""And for example, these people have the necessary papers, so in the social plan, do you put them to work? Then, finally, we [find] that it is not the case. So we have the programs with different names that organize this, but regularly there is a control too. We look, if the documents and these papers have been checked so that we are less certain that these people are illegal in the country. But this is something that often reminds you of the bet. What I mean is, as an employer we don't get away with it anymore."	1
The FDCPA needs to be brought into current times. It is more efficient and effective for collectors for sure. It is the preferred method of communication for consumers without a doubt. Most would certainly rather get an email or text, rather than a phone call. Regular mail is inefficient and becoming more expensive every year and often ignored. It benefits everyone to update to allow using modern technology to communicate with each other. Social networking is can should be used for locating only. I don't believe that communications through social networking is in the best interest for any of the parties involved.  	0
I have already asked the question: Why do these people come to us? Europe is rich, we are very rich. However, we deprive these people of their existence. What we don't want to eat, I think for example of chicken wings, so it produces the bankruptcy of many productions, because, of course, it is more expensive.	0
I think we have enough controls, so in particular on all the construction sites we still have the presence of the police, not regularly, and so I would like to avoid situations where we make certificates. So a lot of controls, so we have enough controls in my opinion, we should not buy back controls.	0
Well yeah, I don't completely agree with what you're saying, but I did want to support what we mentioned before, what Juergen said there. I don't see the name, but you are. And we just said that it sounds bad when we say that depending on what the situation is with the immigrants, we are misbehaving. We have to welcome the immigrant, but it should also be clear to him that as a guest he should adapt to different factors and also to the language. And I think that it is not up to us to adapt to them. And that's just, depending on how you want to address it, if we make a remark now, then sometimes it comes across as stupid, then you're not allowed to say anything, then maybe we're not social enough, or then we leave the dirty work to them. That's all true, but it has to be said that many people work in different households. It is also a job and an honorable one at that. So I don't see; these are jobs that we could also do. The improvements that they know compared to their country of origin in our country, such as education, health and such; that is also a plus compared to their country of origin. And I think that it would be something acceptable - we are allowed to ask people to adapt to our language, to our culture, that should be okay.	1
A debt that is paid in full doesn't improve a credit score at all. A debt that is settled for less or paid in full is the exact same. Once the damage is done to a credit score, the damage will remain. The only slight (very small) improvement on a credit score is when a bad debt was a credit card account and had over 100% utilization. Once the utilization goes down below 100% (and that occurs when the credit card debt was either settled for less or paid in full) does the credit score improve only very slightly. But the damage is still done and will take years to recover from. __URL__	0
This is an issue - as far as I know - we are even exactly in the illegal area: That namely no employment relationship subject to social insurance is entered into here, but that a person is taken as a vacationer from one country to another - in this case now classically what concerns us, which now perhaps also fits here; Poland-Germany - who are then around the clock in this household and are really here for a small obolus; there comes exactly this scope that the money that is paid here, that this has a high value for someone who can achieve much more for it in Poland than here in Germany, but we are right here, at the illegal area, because it is not a social security employment relationship.	0
Yes, it's true that these problems of migration are very interesting because to know and understand how Hungarians have the conception of immigrants. Later on we will talk about the country I come from, the continent I come from, but just to complete what concerns China: as Pierre said earlier, it's important even in Africa, the Chinese - because it's still interesting and that's why I came to understand the perception of each person towards the foreigner, the immigrant. The Chinese in Africa, the country where I come from, it's Zaire, it's Congo-Belgium, and there was, I don't know, it was almost the richest country in Africa but it's the poorest now. Besides, there are many images that come from the base, it is terrible. And then, as Madam spoke to us earlier, the Chinese there, they have occupied all the economic lands, that is to say, they sell even peanuts on the sidewalks, while there are poor blacks, who do not even have the [clothes] to clothe themselves or even eat during the day does not do that. It's a pretty serious problem and I don't know, it's also because they're working. Because me, I live in France for more than 30 years, I came all young to study and then I stayed but when I go on vacation there and I see that, I ask myself the question, I say: Do I go to the Chinese or do I go to the leader [?], I do not know exactly.	1
One more time I would like to say that immigrants are not only cheap labour. Immigrants are also people with a high education which can give a big potential to the country and bring kind of a new values. For example, I know some cases where people from Belarus assume law companies in Poland, which tightened relations between Poland and Belarus. They are creating many indicatives, for example construction enterprises. What I mean is that they are not coming only for strawberries harvest or construction works but they are also tightening international cooperation.	1
Just a detail about the effectiveness of walls or very strict border controls - we don't have the strong borders, let's take the example of the United States actually, they have established a very guarded border, the high walls between the United States and Mexico - despite it's a very strong way, there are still a lot of illegal Mexican immigrants coming through to find work, so I think that actually, this notion of strong borders - talking [about] walls - is not viable.	0
[...] what my Romanian colleague said is applicable to certain categories of immigrants who already have the necessary education and who come from civilized countries that have not yet joined the EU, such as Croatia. I know that this country is even more civilized than Romania where I come from. And I believe that the Croatian adapts very well as an immigrant in an EU state provided that he accepts the norm of that state. So he has to be aware when he is going to immigrate to a country like Romania or Portugal. First of all, he has to respect the constitution of that state before he has to respect the constitution of the European community. First of all, he has to respect the laws of the state that adopts you, that receives you, that welcomes you. And I believe that the majority of the people must put themselves in a gear that comes from the community. And not the state itself, but I think I'm going to discuss all these aspects in Romania because my colleague promised me to come to Romania to visit me. And as far as my Romanian colleague is concerned, there are people who can adapt and others who find that they cannot adapt. I have known cases of people from (Bessarabia), a place in Romania, who came and had studies but they did not want to adapt. On the other hand, there were others who had no education and they adapted better than those who had education and they came at a stage where they spoke the foreign language of the adopted country better than their mother tongue. That's what I wanted to add.	1
That might work if each state had reasonable, intelligent and realistic collection rules. But just the fact that the cost of getting a report varies wildly shows such disparities from state to state. My opinion is that there desperately needs to be some uniformity. This would help people to know what is expected of them, and what to expect.  	0
In my region, the number of immigrants increased. Especially the number of immigrants which are coming for a seasonal work, construction, and also these immigrants which are coming to the western countries to the EU.	1
In my opinion, the EU wants to establish some limits at the borders of the EU. The whole business economy of the EU is a motor, an engine, whole forces. I believe that this exchange is very important, that there is no need to choose only the economy of conducting the exchanges within the EU. As we know, free movement of markets may introduce some problems. It is also known that there are goods sold with low process[profit], like for example with Africa. There is a need here, to for e.g. to introduce some additional regulations. But in my opinion, we should not only protect those borders, but also expand them on all countries.  	0

So, we're talking about the problems caused by immigration. It is clear that there are problems. So, what are they? There is no money for everyone, everything is linked to the economy, which is ultimately the cement of the world, of Europe. Here, everything is finally posed in economic terms. And when the economic aspect is no longer relevant, and this is where we start talking about immigration in other terms than this that is not good, that is not interesting. But as long as the economic budget balance is good, finally nobody asks the question about immigration. On demand; but yes, let them come, let them come and let them come, if you need to build a church, fine, a synagogue, fine, if you need a mosque, too. But as soon as things go wrong, then finally the immigrants become a lot of misery. That's how it is in Spain. There is the cultural aspect of the church that has never been solved, well Franco solved it in his time, but not Spain. So, this cultural aspect of the church, when we talk about separating things, well, we will see the question of immigration with other eyes, as France does. But in Spain we have started to welcome immigrants, only a few years ago, with the obvious exception of South Americans. Obviously, it is the same language, so they were more easily welcomed. Now, Spain, it brings from Africa, they bring for Latin America, so, and everybody goes where they can go. Europe has always had open doors, when other countries elsewhere have not always been open like those of Europe and Spain is located in a place, obviously, that makes it receive many people who pass through, because afterwards they go to France, Belgium, Germany and this is a problem that we face. So even if it's a transit immigration, for a year or two or sometimes for a lifetime or sometimes it's not just a few days. So ultimately it's an economic issue. We don't talk about benefits today because things are bad. And if things were better, we could try to get into the debate. So we need to ask the economic question and better link it to this immigration question.	0
I believe that the NoFap movement is harmful to men's health, as well as their relationships with women. CMV. The health benefits of masturbation are myriad, [from reducing cancer risks to improving mental health]. The external benefits, including better sexual performance and a healthier attitude towards sex, are also myriad. I believe that the NoFap movement is destructive in the same way that any abstinence movement is: it enshrines the thing it's banning in such a way as to empower it beyond what's realistic. I believe that NoFap is no different than waiting for marriage, which is a whole different CMV, in the way it denies human beings their desire to find physical communication with others, explore their own sexualities, and understand the other sex. I believe that self-denial is dangerous, unhealthy, and unrealistic. I believe that NoFap is destructive to the way men see women as they are placing desires that would otherwise be explored through pornography in other human beings, thus elevating them to standards that they will never meet, damaging the way men interact with women. Yes, I understand that the same argument can be flipped by saying that pornography reduces women to dangerous archetypes, too, but I don't buy that argument: Vin Diesel is always a bad ass every time I see him on a screen, but I don't really think he could fuck anyone up, because I can differentiate between performance and reality. And finally, I believe that NoFap is an excuse for insecure men to blame their own sexual desires and personal inadequacies for the fact that they can't speak to women. I believe that it's creating a fake solution for a real problem, and creates much worse problems as a result. **TL;DR: The NoFap movement is destructive and counterproductive to a man trying to be confident and trying to have healthy relationships with women. CMV.** **	0

Konstans, what you're saying that - it's just this: Who bothers to come over here on foot, and if possible barefoot, over the Turkish mountains? Who is going to do that? Who risks their life doing that? Who? That will probably not be so many. At the moment I am thinking a bit more about the organized smuggling gangs. That is, if any ships set sail in Africa, overstaffed, then there are people who have organized this and who have taken the last penny out of the pockets of these poor people who come over here - there is no denying that they are poor. Also there would be nevertheless possibly a starting point, not from the EC directly, but with support of the EC the request directly in the appropriate countries for the fact to provide that such nonsense does not happen any longer. Control of Morocco, of Tunisia, of whoever is sitting up there on the north coast of Africa, there would have to be controls working before we start stuffing money into them again.	1
If a consumer is notified that their debt has been sold, there should be a way to contact the original creditor to verify. e. there should be a paper trail I see an opportunity for scam artists to claim that (as they are now) the consumer owes money to them and to pay off their debt immediately to the scam artist. With a clear paper/electronic trail, the path a debt takes from creditor to collector to collector can be verified and authenticated for the consumer's peace of mind, and so the right party gets paid.  	0
News is bad for you. CMV The points made in [this]( Guardian article: * News misleads - A car drives over a bridge, and the bridge collapses. What does the news media focus on? The car. The person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he experienced the crash (if he survived). But that is all irrelevant. What's relevant? The structural stability of the bridge. * News is irrelevant to your life - Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that – because you consumed it – allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career or your business. * News has no explanatory power - Will accumulating facts help you understand the world? Sadly, no. * News is toxic to your body - It constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. * News increases cognitive errors - News feeds the mother of all cognitive errors: confirmation bias. * News inhibits thinking - Thinking requires concentration. Concentration requires uninterrupted time. News pieces are specifically engineered to interrupt you. * News works like a drug - As stories develop, we want to know how they continue. With hundreds of arbitrary storylines in our heads, this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore. * News wastes time * News makes us passive - News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence * News kills creativity Edit: formatting	0
"Obama is the best we could do 2008-2013 and complaining about his presidency is pointless, CMV. I know a lot of people complain about Obama and hate on him, even the fairly ""liberal"" people. However, in the US, realistically, Democrats and Republicans are the only ones that are capable of taking the seat in the Oval Office due our (seemingly) two party system. If Romney or McCain was elected into the office, we would (more than likely) still have the PRISM, NDA, etc. But not only would we have that, we would have strict abortion laws, no progress for gay rights, women's rights, etc. So I'd much rather have a PRISM supporting president that supports equality than one who is a social conservative. Whenever I hear people complain on Reddit about Obama (and the majority Reddit is pro-equality), I always point that out, but get downvoted into oblivion. Please tell me why that is? EDIT: To clarify, I don't mean complain about his actions. complaining about his actions is okay, I mean to complain about him becoming president overall is pointless. UPDATE: A lot of you guys raised a lot of good points. [This post in particular]( changed my view."	1
I believe the original consumer applicant on an account has the right to know if an authorized user is delinquent on her or his payments as it affects the original applicant's credit standing. As for telling authorized card holders about the original account holder's default, I would say this is not a good idea. Many parents provide their kids with a credit card, but would not want the credit card company contacting their kids about the parents' debt.  	0
Consumers are typically notified numerous times before the account is sent to a collection agency. It is in the best interests of the credit union to try and resolve the delinquency before it is sent to a collection agency due to the added cost.  	0
"I would like to react to what Marleen said. It's true that there is the political dimension that we have been talking about up to now. And then there is the human dimension, because we all know people of immigrant background, we can have professional relationships, we can have friends. So there is always a look that makes a difference in the way we look at things. And then in France, for example, what is quite the non-plus-ultra for families [...] is to have a kid who studied in the United States or England and who started working in the United States. And strangely enough that person doesn't have that look of immigration, of their children in another country. If you tell them that their children are immigrants, they will say... ""no, they're not"". It's always difficult to reason in relation to a close environment. And then to reason in a more global way or there the things we can have complete contradictions in relation to what if lives in the daily life. I find that this is what is difficult in these questions of immigration and the policies that are implemented. [1 :"	0
"If you have a standing complaint with a company's mishandling of your account and/or complaints with any federally recognized oversight bureau, like CFPB, a company should be required to resolve the dispute before prosecuting what they define as a breach of debt. Banks and companies should not be allowed to try to prosecute over ""missed"" payments that were erroneously processed by them. Especially when evidence has been provided to the contrary and disputes are on file. Continuing to place the burden of proof on the consumer is onerous and prohibitive for many consumers. I personally had a problem with a mortgage company and the amount of my time it took to get the problem resolved was worth 20% of the original principal amount. If a consumer complaint is on file, the company should be burdened with disproving the consumer complaint before prosecuting. They have both the financial and personnel resources to do so, whereas a consumer usually does not. Otherwise, why wouldn't they continue to bully and defraud consumers to boost bottom line profits?

I can only fully agree with my colleague from Lithuania Aivaras, yes, illegal migration needs to be controlled more strictly. But I also have some thoughts about legal migration. I think this is only desirable if the people are also well educated. For example, doctors or other medical or paramedical personnel or scientists. If they are well educated, good professionals in their field. Of course, they will also find a place in our countries, because of course they can contribute their competences, their qualifications well here. We also have to make restrictions there and perhaps also set quotas. I would be in favor of a quota system. One could even think about tenders, that one assigns such places, practically such immigration after a tendering procedure.	0

"Remember that marriages are not necessarily monogamous. There are many shades of non monogamy. There is outright going against one partners wishes, there is one partner looking the other way but not wanting to know about it, there is a one way open marriage. Then there are couples where one of them is bi-sexual, whom might engage in non-monogamy with the same person, or they may just simply have an open relationship. Some marriages have nothing to do with sex. Or you get arrangements like these: Keeping what I said in mind, and not letting a lifetime of monogamy stop you, why is a lifelong commitment to another person troubling to you? Having someone to always have your back, to take care of you when you are sick, to enjoy good times together, to possibly raise offspring with... I agree that nobody should ""expect"" you to get married. But a lifelong commitment to another person can be incredibly positive if you choose the right person."	0
It's not... I think it's not one or more member states can find a solution there. Turkey, for example, wants to be in the European Union. If it succeeds, then we have to tell the Turks, they have to take measures. So there must be agreements, for example, to send the immigrants back. Greece alone cannot cope with this. All European countries, all countries of the European Union, must play their part. The European Union must protect the European borders. We are talking about hundreds of kilometers of coastline. For example, we have islands with 80 inhabitants and there are more than 500 illegal immigrants living there. It is up to the European Union to take the necessary measures and countries like Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and so on. If these people don't respect their agreements, then you just have to take sanctions. The whole Mediterranean area is affected by this.	1
This brochure is very good, but the solutions that it presents are presented separately. I think that we cannot solve the phenomenon by taking each of these solutions well to limit by white lines, because it is rather by combining different aspects of each of these solutions that we would manage to try to solve the problem.	0
"I don't believe that debt tolling should be legal. For instance, I had a medical crisis while living in Illinois for college. Despite having insurance, I still ended up deeply in debt. I attempted to work with the debt collectors, but I just couldn't keep up due to the massive amounts. I moved back to Wisconsin where I'm from. The debt has since become time-barred in Wisconsin due to the statute of limitations. It's not on my credit report and I can't be sued for it here. However, should I ever wish to return to Illinois again, it's like I never left and I can be raked over the coals by debt collectors all over again, including being sued. This doesn't make any sense. Either I get sued or I don't. It's been over 10 years, and it's not like I skipped the country and ""hid"" from them. I'd like to return to Illinois, but doing so would kill my credit. They had 10 years to sue me. Isn't that enough? This is unfair and I believe the issue of debt tolling should be explored. It's just not right.  "	1
I believe that all schools in all stages of education should be free. CMV Just to be clear, I believe that no one should be **able** to pay for school (except for extra curricular things like excursions). I believe that the money which goes into schools and universities should come from our taxes and that schools should receive an amount of money depending on the amount of students attending it. The problem I have with the current system is that wealthier families send their kids to private schools and many poorer families are forced to send their kids to public schools. Whilst public schools can still be good, I don't see why any child should receive a better education than any other child, no matter how much money they have. If all schools were free to attend then eventually, I predict all schools would become much more equal, meaning that everyone would receive a much more equal education, which could eventually close the gap between rich and poor rather than widen it the way it does now. I assume this would be incredibly difficult to implement, but could it still work in theory?	0

I don't know if I'm going to answer this question, because of course I'm all for helping these people to stay at home, because for them it's certainly not a pleasure to come here. I don't know if we would be able to do it already. I don't know if we would be able to do it. It's a question of courage, too. I preferred that we try to do everything we could to help them on the spot. But now we have to ask ourselves how to help them. For example, I don't know why, but I want to focus on Africa because it is a continent that suffers the most. Which was exploited by, besides, maybe not by me, who is Polish, you, you are all former countries in worse colonization - Dutch, Belgian and the French. At the moment, excuse me, but I'm starting to get a little confused, it [end of the magician] but I'm trying to calm down, finally you are undergoing something in fact, that you have made undergo, or certain people during the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th century. You must not forget that. Now, it is a big problem for you, because there are immigrants. They have a different culture, they are Muslims or not, but we must not forget that for example the Dutch in Indonesia when they led the colonial war against the people who were trying to liberate themselves, they did not have the moral and everything that follows. We must not forget that. What we have now is a lot of rotos from third world countries. And now here we are, so that we can help them, not only by sending funds or sending food perhaps, first we must review our political ties. With countries down there that have certain regimes in place in Africa, maybe we should start with that. Because we don't talk about CAB anymore, we support the political regimes in place. That's it.	0
"The current validation notice is already too long--bordering on ""boilerplate"". To add more language to this would confuse or intimidate the least sophisticated debtor and/or lead them to immediately ask that the creditor cease communication. The problem with that strategy is that it forces the creditor to file suit, thereby incurring court costs that will be added to the debt. Instead, debtors should be encouraged to communicate their questions & concerns to the collector who can then (after right-party verification) openly discuss the account & quite possibly answer the debtor's question(s).

While I do not advocate daily robo-calling, I have to wonder why a consumer finds themselves on the receiving end of these calls? Receiving the daily call would indicate the consumer is also continually ignoring this debt. Sadly, there is a demographic that thinks this way. If the consumer has found themselves in a tough spot I would think they would choose to take the call or contact the debt collecting entity to try to remedy the situation. As far as regulations I do believe that one call a week is sufficient. The idea of the robo-call is to keep the debt on the consumers mind in an effort that when they get the money they will remember to call and pay the debt. Any other purpose I think would be considered an attempt to annoy the consumer into paying. The demographic that allows this is never going to pay anyway so why play the game. Even a robo-call costs money so why continually throw good money after bad. In 30 years of this business I realize there are two types of people, the one's who want to pay their bill and the ones who never intended to pay in the first place.  	0
"There should be a monetary ""floor"" required before debt collectors can pursue uncollected debts in court. The idea that corporations that already charge puninshing interest rates and fees can clog the court systems trying to collect a few hundred bucks from someone who is unemployed, ill, or otherwise unable to pay is counter-productive. There should be a minimum amount of consumer debt owed before creditors can sue debtors. Another issue with using state and local courts to settle debt collection suits is that it burdens jurisdictions already heavily burdened with cases and strapped for cash.  "	0
I'm not sure I understand, but what I think you are saying is quite offensive... Maybe I am misunderstanding something... GATE has nothing to do with struggling students, it's for the kids who are able to learn faster or at a higher level than the average kids around them. What does that have to do with kids who are having trouble learning the normal material? Are you saying we should stop encouraging kids to learn as much as possible and just treat the smart kids like normal kids and hinder their development purely so we don't hurt someones feelings? I'm sorry if your kid has less potential than mine, but why does that mean my child who is above average should not be able to learn at his rate? Special-Ed classes help the kids below average. Gate classes help the kids above average. Obviously we can't teach every kid individually, but why not at least have some sort of distinction so that each kid is more likely to reach his potential. By your reasoning we should put all kids in the special-ed classes just so we don't hurt anyones feelings. That's how absurd your post sounds to me. I am sorry if my post feels a little hostile, I just feel offended that someone actually think we should actively and directly hinder a kids potential just for the sake of someone potentially feeling bad about not being above average.	0
I recommend that the option to bring a suit in the jurisdiction where the consumer signed the contract should be removed. In many situations, consumers may not actually sign a contract (e.g. credit cards), they may sign an agreement in a distant location (for medical payment at a hospital on vacation), or they may have moved in the years since opening the account. I believe the most consumer-friendly option is to file suit where the consumer resides at time of commencement (unless it concerns real property and then it should be where the property is located). With respect to geographic size concerns, it is important to note that many states are facing budget crises that affect the civil divisions of state courts. In one of our largest districts, our options for filing suit was reduced from 32 courts down to 2. If there is a concern for protecting consumers in this particular area, I recommend a section of the rule that prohibits collections from choosing a court venue with the intention of interfering with the consumer's ability to participate in the action. To prove a violation, the consumer (or regulatory agency) would need to demonstrate that the collector had no reason to file suit in that court other than burdening the consumer (thus demonstrating intent).  	0
I agree. Most creditors already have this information in contracts and other correspondence to the debtor. This additional notice is unnecessary would be cumbersome and costly.  	0
We have only one option with regard to illegal or irregular immigrants: It is to give them the possibility to legalize, to settle legally in our country. It is a horrible scenario, so the vision that we would close the European borders. Even if we build a 10-meter wall around Europe, there will still be opportunities to come to Europe and the attraction or the desire to overcome this wall will only grow. That's it.	0
JÜ:  We in Berlin, of course, have the problems of the stragglers with our Turkish workers, whom we have had for over 40 years now. We have schools where only Turkish is spoken, and the parents don't want their children to learn German properly. And we already have problems with that. We have Yugoslavian immigrants with us, where it is the same. And the worst thing for us in the big city of Berlin is that these population strata are settling again in certain neighborhoods, which was not really what was wanted. It was said that in order to make it easier for people to immigrate to Germany, we want to relocate them, we want to place them among the Germans, so that they can grow up with the language, with the culture, so that we can adopt their culture. That is an enrichment for us in Germany, we have seen that in the past, where the emperor let the Huguenots come to Berlin, how our culture has grown and we should keep that. But I say, all immigrants who come legally or illegally, who come illegally, they don't come for nothing. That was already said by Ana correctly, somewhere it is missing in the countries and they do not come in illegally to us for nothing. So these all, how they want to come in the individual countries, should first be ready to learn language in the text and in the expression. Then they are certainly welcome in many countries. But as it is with us at present still in Berlin that they are not ready to learn the language, then they are also not welcome. Welcome are those who want to do something for the gross national product, who want to bring the country forward. And those who only want to rest on their bones, that's probably how everyone feels, namely only accept the social aspects and gratefully accept them, want to profit economically from them, probably every country doesn't need them like that. And that is already once a problem, which actually the politicians in completely Europe - and if we want to grow together still more closely and should, which would be naturally fantastically, there one must address these things also times with the politicians. This year we have the big party elections again where you could go up to your individual politicians and say, I don't like what you are doing. You would have to actually listen to the people again, listen. Where is it stuck with us in the people, why are we not ready to accept every legal or illegal immigrant? Why? And they don't. They are a small circle here in Brussels, have their employment more and less, nothing more. Thank you.	1
I once had a debt collector send collection letters to my work address. They had my home address. I think this should also be prohibited. Who gets personal mail sent to them at work?  	1
I believe 9/11 was an inside job. CMV Around my senior year of high school (2009-ish) I became quite interested in public events and foreign relations and wanted to become more knowledgeable about how the United States compared to the other nations without the star-spangled bias you get from public school and fox news. Not too long after that I was exposed to 9/11: In Plane Site as well as others, and the copious amounts of conspiracy videos of YouTube. As someone of above average intelligence and a skeptic by nature I have never taken conspiracy theories too seriously, as many rely on sparse circumstantial evidence but for whatever reason this feels different. My main reasons for suspecting foul play in order of importance: 1. BUILDING 7!?!? 2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns. 3. Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns. 4. Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene. Im honestly not sure what to make of all this evidence, but something just strikes me as unsettling, and I see a lot of skeptics to whom I look up to (Micheal Shermer, Bill Maher to a lesser degree, etc.) dismissing the notion and Im not sure what Im overlooking that they arent. Im swearing into the Navy on Wednesday and this is the my biggest cause of apprehension about joining the war machine so hopefully one or more of you fine people can CMV! disclaimer: First Post so I apologize in advance if I am in violation of any rules or protocol EDIT: That didn't take long. Thanks to those who responded, now I'll rejoin the ranks of the lurkers. EDIT #2: So a SHIT TON of new comments over night, and sorry to say I cant address them individually, not that yall are craving my opinion, but I read them all and its good to note that other seemingly intelligent people shared my concerns and skepticism and I really enjoyed the healthy discourse below. Both sides have produced compelling arguments but after reassessing probability figures and relinquishing my right to observe evidence and draw my own conclusions due to my egregious lack of knowledge on the subject, the reality is that it would be insurmountably difficult to orchestrate something of this magnitude. I still think its a little fishy, but my common sense tells me thats probably due to authorities lack of a clear picture, not direct involvement and subsequent cover up. Thanks again for playing, hope to see you all again. EDIT #3: here is a [link]( to a post in /r/conspiracy detailing the arguments that cast doubt on the official story in much better detail than I had previously. Another redditor brought that to my attention and thought you guys may have a go at it.	1
So, with regard to these things, with this uniform law, that we want to do everything through one thing with the immigrants, I see the problems that each individual Member State has set up its individual national rights, and that will be very difficult, if we have just heard the example from Austria, that they are still fair to the individual national laws. And if we do it all through one thing, again European law, then, yes, then I see the problem that the discussions will be big and in the end there will be a big softening of the individual national laws and there I think the individual Member States have gained nothing at all. And I have to say that this is very problematic. From a European point of view, I welcome the fact that we want to adopt this under European law, but I think we are already failing in other areas, such as when we want to prosecute tax evaders, that the recovery directives are being implemented, and we already have our problems there. I don't know how we want to manage that, because I think 27 member states are far too many opinions to create a super law that everyone is satisfied with. And that's why I can see that there will be more softening than would do justice to all the individual member states. I would think it would be great if we could do it, but I don't think it will be really successful.	0
What I find very difficult is that the quality of our prices is dropping at the expense of many people who come to our countries out of necessity. So because they are willing to work cheaper, for example, a lot of our wages are destroyed and they are exploited, that's the difficult part.	0
Assignments without notice could lead to consumers paying the wrong person. The CFPB should encourage proper notice by ruling that a payment made to either of the assignee or the assignor reduces the debt.  	0
"&gt;Psychology is not a valid science because it cannot observe or test empirical data. I disagree. Good psychology only observes and tests empirical data. I think what you may have a problem with are the theorized mechanisms behind those observations and data. Every scientific discipline that studies things about which little is known must rely on some degree of theoretical speculation. But those speculations are always based on the best data available and are amenable to change as new data is obtained. There are plenty of phenomena in physics, astronomy, biology, chemistry, etc that have not been directly observed but have been inferred because the rest of the evidence we have collected points very strongly toward a certain conclusion. Psychology is no different. The object of study of psychology might be complex in a unique way but by no means is it impossible to study. By repeatedly observing human behavior under very specific and constrained conditions, psychologists can narrow down the potential factors underlying a given behavior, often with great precision. Granted, at the end of the day, we call these theoretical psychological constructs things like motivation, self-esteem, depression, personality, and so on and it seems like you might have a problem with that. There is no ""thing"" in the human body or brain that corresponds directly to one's self-esteem and I can see how some people might be skeptical of trusting such a concept. But in a laboratory, and often in real life, experimenters can manipulate this thing we call self-esteem and predict the results with surprising accuracy based on the body of knowledge that psychological scientists have collected. You can take issue with the identification of psychological constructs and theoretical speculation in the field of psychology, many psychologists certainly do as well. But I really don't think you can say that psychology is not a valid science because it can't observe or test empirical data. Good psychologists do nothing but empirical observation. As with all science, it's the interpretation of the results or empirical observation that gets tricky. And especially so when studying something as complex as human cognition and behavior."	0
"Point 1. I think that one of the biggest reasons they have bathroom segregation is because of the potential social awkwardness between genders. Imagine this guys...You're completely destroying this bathroom. Maybe you had some re-fried beans for lunch, or maybe that sushi from last night just isn't sitting right, regardless, you're totally annihilating this toilet. Suddenly, you hear a knock at the door. ""Someone's in here!"" you murmur. You wrap things up as quickly as you can. You get yourself cleaned up and open the door, only to see the most drop-dead gorgeous woman you've ever laid eyes on, and she actually kinda smiles at you. Then the mustard gas cloud you had trapped in the unisex restroom wafts out and hits her. You watch as that smile turns to confusion, then to horror, and even tears. By the way, that situation is even more uncomfortable the other way around for women. We're more uncomfortable about our shit smell than anybody. I know some of you guys are reading this thinking, ""I don't give a fuck, bask in my ambiance, bitch!"" but for some people, it really is an uncomfortable situation. Also, point 2, I do think that unisex bathrooms increases some likelihood of rape/molestation. In segregated bathrooms, a man is somewhat deterred from going into the women's room for fear of being seen entering(not that this stops it from happening but it is at least a deterrent). However, a man going into a unisex bathroom to prey on a woman or child is much less noticeable. Point 3 is just the differences in genders. Do you guys really want to see tampon dispensers on the walls and bloody period pads in the trashcans? Women don't care to see urinals or condom dispensers, or whatever else you guys have in there. Point 4. Not that this is always a bad thing, but unisex bathrooms greatly increase the chance of hetero sex happening in the bathroom. A man can enter and a female shortly behind, and no one bats an eye. This may be great for the amorous couple, but what about the rest of us? What about the line that's forming because these two love birds are having an all night fuck fest? What about the poor soul who is next to enter to find bodily fluids covering the walls? What about the janitor who has to scrub that shit at the end of the night? Finally, I personally don't like sharing a bathroom with anyone, but if I must, I'd rather it be a woman. We may be disgusting creatures, but at least I know what to expect, and the judgement will be limited."	0
I think that diamond engagement rings are a sham. CMV First off, a bit about me. I'm a young male, I don't want to get married yet, but would like to some day. I also don't want a big wedding, or to have children, so I guess you could say that i'm not very traditional. I have no problem buying a plain ring or a ring with an alternative to diamonds, as long as it's under a couple of hundred euros. The main reason I don't want to buy an engagement ring is money. They are ridiculusly overpriced. I'm not willing to pay a couple of grand for a shiny rock. I think the money could be much better spent on a a great holiday, or to help start your married life together. Also, I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren't rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market. I think that people are brainwashed into thinking that this is a symbol of love. That your prospective life partner doesn't think you're worth it, if they don't buy you a shiny rock. This materialistic urge that is drilled into people fom a young age, by people who stand to profit from it, is something I don't buy into, and don't want to comply with or encourage. I want my view changed because all the women in my family disagree with me, and i'm worried about it leading to relationship problems down the line. Edit: My view has been partially changed in some ways. I can now see some merit in certain people buying diamonds. Alas my core beliefs on the subject stil hold firm. Thank you to everyone who commented. I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it had and i've thuroughly enjoyed this discussion.	1
I have a charged off debt I want to pay off. I cannot afford a lump sum and asked the debt collector and original lender in writing mutiple times to work with me on a settlement. They refuse to answer my letters and I keep writing every month. I think they should be made to at least respond to a customer requests for repayment. They keep asking for my employer name and bank account number because I know they want to use it to garnish my wages and bank account. Of course I do not have $32k to settle. It was a 2nd mtg, I lost home due to loss of job, they refused to modify because they said investor wanted to foreclose instead.  	1
I see another problem. The children don't have the opportunity to learn the German language from early childhood. Then they have difficulties with their environment, they have difficulties in school and therefore they don't learn a trade. They don't have a training, so there, it would also be necessary [...] in the countries.	0
It is true that I come from the region where a lot of gypsies live. They really did not integrate well in the society. The European policies are not determinate. There is not enough decisiveness. We do not really know what is going on around us.	0

I have one debt in the court. Here is my issue, I never received any paperwork saying there was a court date. I did receive a letter from my bank a month after the court hearing saying they received a garnishment notice. They could've saved the court costs since I already had told them I was unemployed. Secondly, after I received the bank letter, I then received three (that's right three) garnishment hearing notices from three different companies for the same debt. Since I was unemployed I could not afford to get an attorney. It would've been nice if I could have provided the court (telephonically or by pre-trial documents) with documentation to explain why I was unable to pay the debt, but the paperwork said to only respond if you did not owe the debt. I believe court documents and debt companies should have easier and clearer paperwork for the lay person to understand their rights. And yes, debt collectors should have to provide documentation that the debt is owed and they have the right to collect.  	1
"I believe that the new ""score hiding"" system is poorly done and only makes viewing comment threads more annoying. CMV The intention is to allow people to not upvote other posts simply because they already have upvotes, but it didn't address the reason that upvoted posts gather more upvotes. No one looks at a comment and thinks, ""Wow, 2140 other people liked this, certainly it's worth another!"" Rather, the reason that upvoted posts accumulate upvotes is simply because they get seen more. People stop scrolling down at some point. And even with votes hidden, *reddit doesn't change the sort order*. Upvoted posts still gather upvotes like a torrent."	0
There are a few states that have the barbaric practice of actually arresting people for their debts by using a legal loophole. Some of the most egregious examples are in Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri. The creditor sues the debtor in court. If the person fails to show, a warrant can be issued for their arrest. The police can actually arrest and jail the debtor until a court hearing, or until they pay the bond (which is usually the amount of the debt). This is a downright abuse of the legal system. These loopholes need to be closed in all states.  	0
Yes but if a worker is unemployed and gets unemployment benefits, as a legal worker yes. But if you're unemployed and you get unemployment benefits, you still pay taxes. That's still... the laws have to be respected, I mean by that. There are already situations of immigrants who maybe committed a crime, are in prison. Well, then they should be expelled from the country. They have committed a crime and that's what I mean when I say control entering and leaving the country.	0
When alleged debtors are served with state court summonses, they are not always comprehensible to laypersons.

That the debtor may wish to consider bankruptcy if they cannot pay their debts.  	0
"I am not a lawyer, but I have noticed that credit card agreements often contain statements advising consumers that if suit is brought, it will occur in a specified jurisdiction or ""as provided for by law."" At the point where collectors start suing consumers is where many consumers say enough and hire a bankruptcy attorney. The only winner in that situation is the bankruptcy attorney.  "	1
"I knew a man who was sued by a debt collector and he was not served. ""Someone"" was served, but not at his address and he was denied due process. He learned of the suit when it was a judgment on his credit report. He attempted to have the judgment overturned for lack of due process and the judge would not grant it. Unfortunate, but yes they are allowed to deny due process and get away with it.  "	1
During the break, I thought about what we were saying earlier and I think that already, between men and women, we don't have the same sense of sensitivity regarding immigration. If I look around this table, I have the impression that women in general, I am sorry for the gentlemen, are more tolerant and more open to a certain form of cultural mix and integration and men are more recalcitrant, we will say, to this opening. Having said that, I listened to what was said just now, and I asked myself two questions, which are fundamental questions; when we are dealing with the problem of immigration, first of all, what do the immigrants expect from us and what do we expect from them? So, there were some answers already, we expect them to be hard-working, to be courageous, to be honest, to be respectful, okay? And so that's what we expect from them. And what do they expect from us? Well, they can expect certain things. We're talking about legal immigration. They can wait to have a good job, they can wait to find themselves with that good job in a peaceful country, they can also wait, if they already have family, in the ten countries, to be able to find, join their family. Okay, they have all the right reasons to want to come here. But there are always counterparts and it is true that we cannot tolerate all of them and I think that we must put a B on this and say that immigration works well if it is controlled. If we don't do anything, because by wanting to integrate all these people, by wanting to get all the misery in the world, we create frustrated people in our countries, we create people who may be unemployed, they may think - rightly or wrongly - that it is the immigrant who has taken a potential job. As a result, there is a risk of tension, rivalry and animosity. Is immigration at all costs good, even for us? We really have to think about this. I say that welcoming people is very good, I am in favor of diversity, I am in favor of all these mixtures and integrations, but we must not let it be too much, because too much is necessarily to the detriment of one or the other party. It can be really even downright damaging, you have to be extremely careful.	0
I don't think the consumer should have the options as to when and how they are called. Most collection agency's today would remove a consumers phone number hen asked.  	0
I believe that the media has a liberal bias CMV Everyone is biased one way or another. I don't believe that either the left or right side of politics is completely right - I'm not claiming that they are equal - just that when you are in a bubble it is easy to not understand the other side's point of view. Now, I believe that journalists, despite their best efforts, will exhibit some degree of bias too. This will lead to the majority of the media having a liberal bias, since most journalists are [liberal]( Of course, some outlets (Fox news) have a heavy conservative bias. I'm not claiming that the liberal bias is anywhere near as large as many conservatives would have you believe, just that it exists	0
so at this point I would like to contradict my two previous speakers in a way. Just because the language is the same, even if it's helpful, that's not a guarantee that there will be integration. There are other countries that have much more practice. Look at the United States, they've had two populations for 200 years, one colored, one white, and if you look closely, one Hispanic. And they are far from being a homogeneous people. And we are not going to become a homogeneous Europe, whether we have an EU parliament or not. And it's not bad at all that there are Greek rites and customs in Greece and German customs in Germany. But it becomes difficult when you expect people to live there who don't share that. Then it becomes more and more complicated. There are certainly people who accept this and want to have rights and duties, the right to live here, and therefore also the duty to integrate. But just - it is not the normal case. You can't see that. We have only 2.4 percent Turks in Germany and yet the Turks are, so to speak, the dominant group of foreigners.	1
well, as I said. Now that would be my question. So if my information is correct, then I think we Germans would get big problems with the illegal immigration in Spain, if that would be abolished, because our tomatoes and strawberries, which we like to eat at Christmas, would become tremendously expensive. Because then we wouldn't have access to the cheap labor there. What I want to point out is that we always pretend that it's just a problem, but when we're talking about the economy, we don't really have in mind the aspects that we're taking advantage of.	1
"Many others have said something similar to this, but I think it's good to restate: AIDS is way more a socioeconomical problem than a health issue. Condoms are inexpensive and very efficient to prevent infection and people being treated has almost zero chance of transmitting it. The world right now have technology and money to get rid of AIDS before finding it's cure, but we lack of information and distribution of this money. The said ""risk"" population are almost always in this situation because they don't know they should prevent themselves (like old people, who's been the most affected by the disease in developed countries) or people that suffers from bad governments, by the lack of condoms and treatment to infected. Plus, the people that uses injectable drugs, which is itself a social issue and people that gets infected in hospitals by blood tranfers and instruments, which is also related to investment in health. The simple bureacratic action of registering the infected has no effect at all above the real causes of AIDS spread."	0
"I don't hate nickleback, as I think it's sort of silly to hate something that you can pretty easily ignore if you choose to. I *hate* genocide, gang violence, school shootings, and neo-nazis. I *don't care for* Nickleback. That said, I think Nickelback represents a change in the music industry, and while they were neither solely responsible or even the worst example, they were one of the first, most successful, and (perhaps most importantly) longest-living bands to come out of the late 90s / early 2000s mainstream music industry. Up until and somewhat through the 90s, there was a balance between artistic integrity and selling records. Obviously some people only cared about art, and some people only cared about money, but there was a balance struck between both of these things that was kept for most of the 'big acts' you heard on the radio. In many cases bands would put out one or two records under strict label control with ""hitmaker"" producers, and then once they proved themselves, they would be free to explore their artistic whims and put out really great records. But even the early, ""reigned in"" records were often times still produced with a balance in mind. Look at Nirvana: Their major label debut, ""Nevermind"", was terribly overproduced by the standards at the time, but it still had a bit of artistic legitimacy to it. And then they put out ""Incesticide"" which didn't win them any friends at their label, followed by ""In Utero"", which was a really good balance of art and business sense. At some point, though, the major labels stopped caring about maintaining a balance and started only caring about efficiency in moving units. The ""rock music"" they were pushing was replaced with manufactured pop music produced over blandly written, contrived guitars designed to sound harder than traditionally pop but still be universally accessible. That's where Nickelback came from. That's where Creed came from. That's where basically every ""new"" band to emerge onto mainstream rock radio after the year 1996 or so came from. But like I said before, Nickelback was one of the first, most successful, and longest lived of the ""new school"" of mainstream radio rock. Because of this, their name has sort of become synonymous with all of these manufactured pop bands masquerading as rock and designed solely to move records as of late. I think it's inappropriate to hate them or make personal remarks about them, I mean, they're just some dudes doing a job, but I can understand why people would have a strong distaste for their band as an artistic entity."	0
Yes, one of the biggest scams that consumers get put through is the collection agency saying discussions about the debt have to be made with the parent company, and the parent company saying they cannot talk about the debt because it has been assigned to a debt collection agency, Please FIX THIS.  	0
But how to determine what is the quota or immigrants quotas? How to determine the needs of the country's labour sector for high qualified workers and not? For the low professional recording workforce it is much more difficult. Of course every country has such people that can be hired for simple work and therefore can give them a work permit. Some of the immigrants have a very difficult social and material situation so they could get some kind of training from the state to learn something more useful.	0
1007 I can only confirm that the situation for example in our country, Belgium is similar. As a matter of fact, from what I have heard, it is the same as in Holland. We have the administration of law, which is slow and needs time. This is really inordinateness and takes too much time. If one needs to wait years for any asylum decision, the person already integrates works and has children who attend school. And after six, seven or eight years, there is a decision that those people need to leave the country because they do not meet some asylum criteria. I think that it is an unfair situation. It should not be this way. 	1
In my experience, simply contacting a person to collect a debt, time-barred or otherwise, implies litigation is possible and/or impending. It shoud be clearly stated in any communication if the debt is time-barred and these types of debts should not be discussed by a phone call initiated by the collector.  	0
Look, its 2013! Ignoring phone calls is annoying and constantly seeing missed calls is aggrivating. Why are bill collectors stuck in ancient times? Text me!! Email me!! Those phone calls are not going to be answered because I work and have kids. Communicati g with them would be so much easier if I could text and email these people. Seriously this is not 1950 we live in!!  	1
"Current debt substantiation requirements all suffer from the same significant shortcoming in that they fail to address the often symbiotic relationship between first-line creditors, collectors, reporting agencies, consumer data clearinghouses, buyers of bad debt, and others industry players. Each has a vested profit motive in the ""validation"" of debt. Without appropriate disincentive--i.e., enforcement of rules and stiff penalties for non-compliance--corners are cut and quid pro quo-type behaviors begin to surface. Consumers hold few cards and have to play against a stacked deck. The validation process should involve more than merely inquiring with the creditor about the validity of the debt or the identity of the debtor, and failure to observe all the necessary steps--in the sunshine, no less--should have severe consequences. The best deterrent would be putting the power back in the hands of the (truly-wronged) consumer through the inclusion of ""private attorney general"" style enforcement mechanism. Awarding attorneys' fees and damages, with the ability to elect either actual or meaningful statutory damages (similar to the scheme introduced by Congress into the copyright statutes), would create serious disincentives for anyone involved in unscrupulous validation practices.

I think that Obama hasn't made any good decisions since he took office. CMV I think that the president hasn't made any good decisions since he took office. I think he is the scum of America, downright Yelawolf style crook. If you can give me examples of some good things that he has done, that would suffice, I mean it's good to have an open mind and I don't want to seem purposefully ignorant.

I live in New Jersey and I am 17 years old, I wish to gain an unbiased and factual answer for this. Thank you.	1
Maybe you also have to take into consideration the immigration structure. Let's talk about legal immigration, so especially family reunion. So we're talking about children, wives, the family being reunited, I think that's a human right. So I would say that this was uncontested. As far as the qualification of training is concerned, every country can offer training to its citizens, to its potential citizens, but there has to be a will; it has to be known whether this will exists or not and whether integration is lived or not. It can work well, it can't work. There are some examples in Austria where it works very well, but there are other examples that completely fail [...]. So, highly qualified people can immigrate without any problem, there is a system that exists but it is also very, very difficult and there are quite important obstacles. We have to ask ourselves in general: Where are we going? Do we need immigrants, do we treat them respectfully, regardless of their background, or is it a political calculation, do we want to form an opinion against immigration in general? The media make me think that it is more like that; they really try to form an opinion against immigrants, even highly qualified ones, especially against human beings who simply need our help, so asylum seekers. And in Austria, the climate is such that we try to deny help to these people, which I find serious. And here I plead for an active intervention of the European Union in this field.	1
I do not agree, when it come to company call or text all day and night. New federal rule should not do this at all. It sound like somebody is getting pay to put this new federal laws. It all about money as always  	0
I have never applied for credit in any way other by paper application, and everyone I have ever owed money to has tons of paperwork. I don't know how it works when you apply electronically, but what's to prevent someone from saying they are owed money? The burden of proof is going to have to be on the creditor, and if they aren't getting paper signatures, they'd better have some pretty good proof otherwise. Meanwhile, if you say they wouldn't lie about it, I would love to sell you my ocean front property in Nebraska.  	1
Telephonic pretrial-hearings can be scheduled in support of a consumer having to work; times set and or scheduled with a court representative could passify this issue.  	0
I have been falsely subserved twice. Both times resulted in verdicts against me. Thank you for taking the time to express your viewpoint, which should carry a LOT OF WEIGHT since you are in it at the ground level. If I had not been falsely subserved, it is possible that the debt collector would have been more humbled and more amenable to my extremely generous offer of agreeing to the pay the debt in full based on what it was at the time of the default, as long as I could start with a very low monthly payment and build it up over time. And as along as I was honoring my word, the debt would no longer be reported negatively on my credit report. But I never got that far because the debt collection companies simply hired someone who would deliver a service, no questions asked as to its legality.  	1
I also don't think that they should be able to call on Sundays. I understand that weekends are probably a good time to call people, but I think that weekend calling should be restricted to less hours (like maybe noon - 5pm) and only on Saturdays. No Sunday phone calls.  	0
Is there any possibility or obligation on the part of the EU, which certainly spends considerable funds on development aid, to provide these countries with proof of use? That's the first thing. And the second is: Why can't the EU attach certain conditions to development aid? In the direction of immigration. You could, for example, if people come here and you can send them back again, and that is solved intergovernmentally, then the whole thing would look somewhat different.	0
"Collectors are responsible for re-establishing contact with delinquent customers and providing services that facilitate repayment of the loans, regardless of the technology utilized. In Collections, automated dialing systems effectively increase the ability for the collector to reach delinquent customers unwilling to proactively reach out to the creditors. Automated dialing systems are used in many other ways not related to debt collection: telemarketers use them to reach potential customers, schools use them to notify parents of closings due to inclement weather. The technology is the same but the intent is different based on the user. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) prohibits creditors from using automated dialing systems to call cell phone numbers without consent from the customer. The TCPA""s original purpose, protecting consumers from costly charges as a result of automated calls, has been subsumed by the new goal of preventing overly numerous call attempts to a number that (generally) is directly connected to the customer. It does not change the purpose of collection calls, it merely makes the process less efficient. Regulating which numbers can be called using an automated dialing system is also counter to the growing reality of wireless-only households. According to the Center for Disease Control's 'Wireless Substitution' latest report (Early release data, July-December 2012), over one third (36%) of adults in the United States live in a household with only wireless telephone service. That figure is even higher (45%) when you look at children living in the US. With an average annualized growth rate of 34%, it is conceivable that sometime before 2020 only a minority of the country's adults will be living in households with a landline telephone that can be autodialed. The CFPB should allow for the autodialing of all telephone numbers provided by the customer without byzantine consent requirements. Regardless of whether it is at application or during the course of normal business, once the number is provided by the customer to the creditor, that number should be considered another viable option for collection.

I had someone in my family, someone who went to the United States before Romania joined the EU. In the meantime, he no longer has legal documents. His passport has expired. I asked if he wanted to return to Romania because now Romania is recognized as a European country. And so the European community should protect its citizens who left for study reasons. But in fact he can't go back to Romania anymore because he doesn't have official documents. And I imagine that there are many Romanian citizens in the same case. In the case of hand separator. Who left to study and now do not have permission to return. I imagine that in the United States there are other laws. But I wonder, what the EU or the state does for its citizens who are in the only possibility to return home because in the meantime they had not yet renounced their nationality. But their official documents are no longer valid.	1
The Permissible hours of 9am - 8 pm is good. I actually would like to see it moved to the other proposed time of 9am - 7pm, but i think 8pm is a fair compromise. Because the current 8am - 9pm really is just way to early/late. I (and many families) are in bed after 8pm and phone afer 8pm really is way too late. I support the 9am - 8pm hours. I further support weekend calling lessened to noon-5pm because people like to sleep in on the weekends and spend time with family. Having a phone call after 5pm really is not necessary as most people will be out and/or entertaining guests at their homes and will not take calls in the afternoon. I further support adherence to blue laws that prohibit consumer contact on Sundays. Sundays really are when most people are spending whatever little time they have left before the workweek with friends and family. I do not conduct business on Sundays. The work week really should be when debt collectors are working on trying to contact consumers.  	1
thank you very much, I haven't said a word yet about all these issues that were on the table. It's gone back and forth a little bit between illegal immigration and legal immigration. It's been mixed up a little bit. But all right now. My question, to the EU specialists would be this: the problem of illegal immigration is big everywhere. Certainly in the southern countries somewhat larger than with us in Germany. Nevertheless, are there efforts? That is my question. Are there efforts in the EU to close the borders for illegal immigration with all the consequences?	0
"I think cyberbullying is BS, CMV Like a lot of people, I was bullied all through school. I understand that all of us are raised differently and not all of us are given the tools to deal with situations like these. I just don't think babying the kids is fixing it. It allows them to be a ""victim"". I know they are victim's but I mean in the sense of that's the tools we are giving them to respond. Aside from that, cyberbullying is even more BS. Maybe I'm just stuck comparing my experience to the fact that the internet is not a ""nice"" place. It just seems silly to think that when you add anonymity people won't be more cruel. At that point, it is literally JUST WORDS on a screen. You can delete posts, block phone numbers, delete accounts...so many more ways to just ""walk away"". Which is exactly what I and many others did when bullied in person. Edit: Great discussion everyone! Thanks for all your input!"	1
I'm going to do a little Tae Quan [SE] with Serge-Henry, in fact you say they are pulled by their rich countries and all its issues. In fact, we were talking about both things at the same time, immigration and climate change becoming ... ... blue. And a little bit of immigration because they're not interested in coming to us anymore. Well - I'm a bit of an attacker, maybe a bit too much, because we know more than we're going to [say?]. But to come to all this. We must not forget that at this moment, people are doing something terrible. Every election that is approaching, we have the example in France at the moment; Sarkozy was the champion of the question, it is a few weeks before the elections, every time, Sarkozy came to us with monstrous security plans and there, it came out at a few days. Although it must have porticos in the entrances of the schools, body searches, we have become a total demagogy. And as long as the policy becomes such a demagogy, it plays on any illegal immigration, legal; as soon as there is a problem, as soon as a decision comes. The media, which are in France or I imagine in Germany, in England, owned by friends of the political power. In France for example the TF1, the site 8 [Direct 8?], the group [...], the group [...] is all owned by friends of the men who are in power now. So everybody does each other favors and the media is chaining mediocrity, that is, that the people should cry and be afraid. And I think that in Europe this makes sense at the moment. There is a governance, not by the European culture? but by the policies of each country that turns miserabilism into fear, into cretinism. And I think that there is a need for the citizens to wake up. We absolutely have to become aware that the world is a very small place anyway. This is the first time that we go from one end to the other in less than 24 hours. And that we are all destined to live together. So I think that the question of migration does not even arise anymore. We should already be beyond this question. Because we are destined for a world without flags [.........]. Everyone tells themselves that, but the nation state is the world, it is no longer the borders of each country, I think.	1
I think that we should not give up the principle of immigration, but maybe make a little stricter selection. I have already said that if someone comes to a country that is not his, then he should adapt to the culture and customs of that country, because it is not easy. Of course, you can immigrate simply to ask for money, but you need an education, a profession, and you need to work.	0
"Yes, but I think, especially with these Turks, the workers were brought because they were needed, and nobody wanted them in their neighborhood, yes? They were housed in containers. And no one wanted them as neighbors. And that's how this skepticism, whatever you call it, developed in the first place, otherwise it probably wouldn't have come to this if they hadn't been ostracized for years. ""Oh, you'd better go [home]!"" That's what people would have liked best, isn't it? And really crammed together. And then of course they hold on to each other, I think. And if you had done it a little differently from the beginning, if you had seen them as people and not crammed them into containers somewhere...."	1
So I think, now, as far as violence or lack of tolerance - I think that has to do, of course, with child rearing, that is, how parents teach their children tolerance.	0
They have done so. I've gotten calls from the same collector who will use a toll free, then a number with an area code, then that number will be changed by a digit. Google the number. That is so helpful. It will tell you the company that is calling. It was always the same on. I agree this is wrong, misleading, a fraudulent way to deal with people. But the totality of all I am reading here is that collectors are harassing and do it by phone. The thing to do is put some teeth into the laws that prevent this. Now, the only thing consumers can do is sue. And for $1000 -- and you'd be hard pressed to find a lawyer who will sue for such a small amount. It has become a situation that slams the consumer, it has evolved into that.  	1
Well, we are talking about immigration - maybe I may give the example of Poland: Today, for example, there is a lot of construction going on in Poland with a view to the Football World Cup in 2012. So football pitches and freeways and much more are being built and the construction workers who come here to Poland for this purpose, i.e. immigrate - I'm sure of that - of course they work black. And the immigrant construction workers, who are brought into the country for very low wages, you can't compare with skilled workers, whom you would - I think, if you would offer them something appropriate, that is not a contract for a few years at a certain wage and that he also lets his family come, if possible, then there is a good chance that he will also stay; and that applies just as much to the Poles, who go abroad to work for this purpose. So it's a question of whether they really want to work and have their family come and stay, or whether it's just temporary, because I wouldn't leave Poland, for example, if I wasn't offered a decent wage; at most, you can take that on temporarily, but otherwise you want to go back home.	1
I would like to say, Portuguese - I am French. In France, we have received many Portuguese, Spanish and Polish immigrants, but it was not a problem and it is still not a problem. Because they are really European races. But nowadays, the problem, you will see more and more, is the problem of Africans. They arrive in whole boats that are made by mafias in the mothers. They arrive on our coasts and for some time now we have not been able to prevent this problem. The EU has to take tough measures for this. It's terrible.	1
I say that indeed, if we legalize all undocumented immigrants as we said, in France, it would create a call for ? and in the countries of origin, people say: They've all been regularized; we all go. And this is not the right solution in my opinion. Legalizing at [?] according to employment criteria for example or other criteria, but massive legalization is not the solution. Besides, apparently now the countries of the European Union are abandoning it. And I wanted to point out another problem. In my opinion, the European Union must get involved in this problem of immigration because with the Schengen area, there are no more borders between some countries of the European Union; for example between France and Germany. So, if a country starts to legalize massive numbers of immigrants, as Spain did a few years ago, these immigrants can then move throughout the Schengen area. So, it is now the concern of all the countries of the Schengen area, so I think that immigration must - at least the countries of the Schengen area must agree on the immigration policy. But the nation states, which are the closest actors on the ground, must also have their say: So there must be a harmonization of national policies, but we must not impose enough on the countries to make choices. Thank you.	0
It's currently the case that we can't really solve the immigration problem, but if that's not the case, then we just have to make the border controls to third countries stricter. And I think we have to be quite strict there, at the European Union level, and once that's the case, then you can see what can be done.	0
"As a former bill collector for over 17 years there are alot of ways the industry needs to be cleaned up. I do believe that a debtor should be informed of when a debt is transfered from original creditor to a collector and whether or not that collection agency purchased the debt or if the agency is contracted by the original creditor to collect the debt. There is a big misconception that I see being made in most of these comments that everything is ""purchased"" which is far from the truth! I personally have not and would not work for an agency that purchased debt, because I know and have heard the horror stories of not only how they treat the debtor but also how the business as a whole treats the collector.

Your imgur link doesn't seem to work. When you talk about things you do mattering, exactly how do you mean it? How big of a contribution do you have to make before you decide that it matters? Is there some number of people you need to help before you matter? Does it count if you matter to a small number of people (friends, family, loved ones) in an intense way? If not, why not?	0
I agree completely with everything you said. I agree but on the other hand every country should take care of its own citizens. For example in Slovenia are many poor Slovenians, so Slovenia should first take care about their own citizens. You can not disregard your own children, own citizens for the good of other people who are not your country’s citizens.	0
Speaking of EU regulations: The famous tractor seat regulation from the EU, that was a pure Bavarian production; the company Fendt in Bavaria had to be led to the world market by the then Minister President, because it was his dozy friend and that's why they passed the funny saddle law at that time in the EU, so, in that case, I even have to help the EU for once.	1
They could set transparent, limited rate increases which debt collectors could charge for each mode of communication that is eliminated. A rule setting that kind of rate increase would add some necessary transparency to the question of whether these kinds of communications are even worthwhile for the agency.  	0

I just want to add that I am not advocating getting out of the debt because of a life changing event. I am advocating that the debt be frozen at the amount it was at the time of the involuntary default and then paid back even if it takes ten years.  	0
Yes, I think it's quite a complex issue because well, we have companies that need workers with very specific skills of course and those workers can work, others don't have those skills and are not allowed to come. They then come in illegally. We've seen that in Spain and Italy, where immigrants are arriving en masse with the ships. What do we do then? Send them back to the country? We can't just say, yes you can and you can't, yes and no. So I think that there really has to be a solution that has to be found by all European countries together. Because this is a problem that is getting worse every day. But it is also a very complex issue, as I have already said. If we have a quota, what do we do? Then do we close our borders and no one is allowed in anymore? I don't know, but this is a very complicated issue. It's very difficult to say, yes, the companies need so and so many workers, on that basis we set our quotas and then if there are too many, then we send them back into the sea. So that's very difficult. I think that's where we have to be very careful not to let xenophobia arise as well.	0
Let's remember that most debtors have had the original creditor from 2 to 4 collection agencies and the creditors attorneys office before a suit is ever filed. That process usually takes as much a 2 years or more. So it is difficult to think that the courts should make special accommodations for these individuals. Every person called into court has had many opportunities to have the debt validated or payment arrangements made prior to a default judgment. I do believe basic evidence should be supplied. This would be a statement or bill copy with a matching name of the consumer and proof of address at the time the debt was incurred. This proof of address could be provided by other confirming data available through skip tracing companies. There were significant problems with how debt buyers were allowed to file suit and receive default judgments with virtually no evidence. So improvements and consistency is needed in evidence but it should also not be expected to show every single bill copy.  	0
I think that those people who immigrate illegally just don't have a visa or can't get a visa and then are trapped here in Germany and then don't come back at all, right? If I understood that about right.	0
"I think it is a worthwhile goal, but not a very practical one. Changing public lexicon is quite a stretch. But there's a very simple reason why it *shouldn't* be used. It's offensive to people who do have intellectual disabilities. I work with students like this, and they've been called the ""r-word"" their entire lives, and it brings up terrible memories of bullying and unequal treatment since as far back as they can remember. While it may seem silly or unnecessary to us, it's the equivalent of walking into a gay bar and calling someone a faggot. It's all about being decent to one another."	1
My student loan company is giving me a ton of grief about allowing my husband to contact them regarding my student loan debt. I've filled out the same form about four times that is supposed to allow him to talk to them on my behalf but any time they decide that they don't like dealing with him, they pull his authorization (sometimes mid-call) and refuse to talk to him about it. He is never rude with them, he just doesn't put up with the run around my loan company gives me. We never hear the same thing twice from them. Issues that are supposed to be taken care of rarely are and we are constantly told one thing by one rep and something completely different by the next.  	1
I think that there is always another side of every problem. Of course we would like to help people who do not have a place to come back, but if we let them all come to our countries without any restrictions it would have been very difficult to handle for us. So we should find a good consensus. We should find some general criteria of who we can send back home and who can stay in our country. It could depend on the country for example: Which country can accept more immigrants and which not? For example, when a country is rich, it can accept a bigger amount of immigrants. It just must be established. I think that first, we should look at a single example, if this case is urgent or if it is an offender who is coming just for criminal matters, or the case when somebody is coming just for economic matters and not political.	0
There needs to be a universal Statute of Limitations. The current system is an absolute mess. 17 states maintain a SOL of three to four years, while 19 others have the six years SOL time limit. The rest all have diverse SOL limits with some extending for even up to 10 years. Tolling provisions make it even more confusing. Simplify it. Have a single NATIONAL Statute of Limitations. Make it fair for everyone (debt collectors and debtors 5 years seems reasonable. Having a universal Statute of Limitations will eliminate confusion and ambiguity as to when and where a debtor can be sued.  	0
"Yes, the word has just come up actually about selection. You have to select who is allowed, who is not allowed. I have a little difficulty with the word ""select"" for historical reasons. According to what criteria do you want to let people into the EC or reject them? Yes? That is one side. Then I have something to say about that, I mean, because it's always been said that way, ""A doctor who is sick can't cure a patient."" If we go on like this, we will be the sick doctor, and at the moment we have economic problems everywhere you look, and we certainly can't solve them by letting illegal immigrants into the European Union. That is not possible, we are sick. So we have to be a bit more consistent on this point of immigration, not ""well maybe"" and ""let's see"" and so on. But I am not necessarily talking about those who come to us because they are politically persecuted or who come from countries that are at war. So I would like to make a small distinction there. Only those who come over because they have heard that they are coming over - coming into the EU - because they have heard that this is the country where milk and honey flow, and they don't know what they are getting into, we can't accept that."	0
People can already voluntarily disclose their status; it's the ones that don't know or are lying you need to watch out for. And you already have a legal obligation to notify any any past and future partners if you have a positive HIV test. Failing to do so is a serious offense. If you mean medical reccords, obviously that already exists. But if you mean public database like rapists? That is a very dangerous implication. As I posted earlier, people will already hold your criminal history hostage for money. Victimizing people further for doing nothing but having an incurable disease is a terrible idea, as it will lead them to lying about it. By implementing these measures, you will terrify any involved, and actively discourage them from seeking treatment (as they will land on the AIDSWATCH.GOV). People will be more likely to lie about being healthy.	0
Our geographical situation in our islands is obviously different from that of the peninsula, we have not experienced problems with legal immigrants, who have been established for many years and the foreigners in our country have accepted and respected our customs in a way in the religious schools, even if they do not follow religious activities, but in no way have they wanted or asked that we remove our religious symbols. People have their own celebrations apart. But the question that arises now is not the legal immigration, but obviously the clandestine. Those who arrive without being asked, without being necessary. I don't know what happened; there was a month and a half or two months without any makeshift boats arriving here, although the method is favourable. So I am very surprised. But now we are in a situation - I don't know if we don't want to, but I speak for them - where they arrive in such a lamentable state. We can't even help them, they go straight to the internment center. Why did they leave   their country of origin. Why are they poor there? Well, they left because they can't live. So, it's a difficult situation to find a solution there. In the Canary Islands, the question of immigration is really serious because there is illegal immigration; the immigrants manage to flow the controls and then, above, obviously, there is delinquency and all the consequences of delinquency. And if they were welcomed, if they had any opportunity it would be better. And, again, we come to the question of work and there is no work for these people. Yes, they have priority in the nurseries, in the schools, for social housing and there are young people who are on the list for an apartment to start a family and they don't succeed. But a foreigner, an immigrant, can't do anything easily. And therefore it will create ill-being. The solution which is right, I do not know. But that's why we're here, to find a solution.	0
I don't know if you know... the World Cup '98... and then the French team won. For two times. I don't know if you understand well. To this French team... so all the French people obviously celebrated, because France was the best team. In '98, the best team. And in 2000 put aside Portugal because it was better than Portugal. And won the final, because it was the best team. They were all French. All of them. Zinedine Zidane and company, they are all French. I think he was born in North Africa, right? Algeria? Algeria. But he's French, they're all French, by the way. And everybody else is French. So the talk of the past is a little disturbing. It is [...] French. Now the French team is mixed, well it is Portuguese, but more and more it is of descendants. Our champion of triple jump, in languor, he was born... his parents are Cape Verdean. He was born in the Ivory Coast, I think. But he is Portuguese, finally. Our long jump champion, she was born in Angola, she is Portuguese. But they defend the Portuguese flag. But that they work. So they earn millions so they kick the ball, and that's it, that's it. They earn their lives. But then we have to know who are the best, who are not the good ones. Those who deserve, those who don't. We have to be tolerant of other people's culture. Islam, for example. We must tolerate them, of course. But then when it comes to women's rights, in particular, it scares me. It frightens me about women's rights. In Islam, it scares me. But in some aspects we have to be tolerant. Because there are things that would never change. Western culture can in some aspects help Muslim women to be more respected by her fathers. But there are some cultural traits that will never change. And religious that will never change. But we will have to respect the culture of others. If we want to be respected, we must respect others as well. We should not think that the western civilization is better than other civilizations. Of all orders. We must not think that way. Because otherwise, it is on the wrong basis. If we want to change what we have done for centuries and in a bad way sometimes the others, we cannot think that we are better than the others. Because civilization, the word civilization was not born in the West. Civilization, there are several, there is not only one civilization. Neither the Western one nor another. So that frightens me, this small speech, sincerely. A comment in off, there is a universal declaration of human right. Which must be respected by all the peoples of the world and despite that, despite the fact that European countries do not respect the declaration. There are some who... If the European countries do not respect it, there are many others who respect it much less. So, we must all together, in a universal way, respect this charter. Because we get used to it, we don't manage to overcome certain difficulties. And then there are some who put their head under the sand, who hide, or who look to the side, with the problem on the right, they look to the left. That way, we won't solve any problems. And finally... I promise you that in the next ten minutes I won't take the floor again. So the demographic question was divided into two - the population of Europe and the increase of non-white population in France and Germany. There are studies that tell us that in a few decades, the Muslim population may even exceed the Western population. Especially in France. Because Muslims in general have more children than other French people. They are all French, but there are Muslims, Muslims have more children than the white French. So I would like to solve the problem, because the subsidies, the compensations that are given to the Muslims in France are the same that are given to the whites who are in France. There is no difference. Everyone receives subsidies, allowances. So what we must have, more children. Yes, us, more children. That's the cultural difference. That's what we don't understand. Because we have a lifestyle. We want to preserve it. That it's compatible with one, two children. And even with two children, it's already complicated. It's complicated. We want to preserve this lifestyle. And these people, in a way these people don't have this concern. They have another lifestyle. And then we said here off the record that living in a gallery... no, we can't give gas to others. We are not better than others. We must help other people to evolve and develop. Because we have committed many crimes, many mistakes during all the centuries. We cannot forget the past. We have committed mistakes and crimes, certainly.	1
"Agreed. And it should be their real phone number. So that when you miss their phone call and try to call them back, it should go to the real company. And not say something like ""the call can not be completed as dialed."" I mean, what is the point in that. Some debtors can't get to their phone before it goes to the answering machine and if the collectors don't leave a message, the debtor will try to call back. But then the call can't be completed when you try to call back. So, really what was the point of the call. Many debtors would just assume it was a scam call. Increasing Right Party Contacts should be the goal. And that goal can only be reached if the real phone number is showing up on calller id.  "	0
I wanted to remind myself, first of all. But also to you. The topic of discussion is immigration. I have heard all kinds of topics. It's true that the applications, the effects of immigration can be seen in various situations. But I am afraid that we have strayed from the topic of immigration. And as we are doing to solve this problem, which concerns us, immigration? I notice that we are focusing a lot on problems that immigrants cause and we are expressing them in all kinds of topics. We told stories. It's the first time I've heard this. The Portuguese immigrants who are sent back after having been used as workers. It's true that there, I will have a question. Rather than saying whose fault it is, I would say, how can we solve their problem so that it is good for the immigrants and for the Portuguese. I consider a way of approach that is not quite efficient in my opinion. I also heard some comments. I don't think it's right to adopt the problems of immigration from a racial point of view. In fact, we are each one as we are with our own color at the bottom. But I would like to ask a question. What do we want to do? Do we want to get rid of this immigration, or do we want to control it in a certain way, or do we want to send it back to the immigrants so that they can solve it themselves? One can tell here, many things many situations that apply in which the negative or positive effects of the immigration can apply. For the European contract all know, but how are we going to solve this problem?	0
We are all people, so for me it does not matter if someone is gypsy, Croatian, or something else. It does not matter from where do we come from, what kind of skin colour we have; I am not interested in that. When somebody lives next to the gypsies, he can not understand their behaviour. In my region, 71% of gypsies live on the social benefit. Sometimes we have the impression that we are blaming them for something bad and then finally, it is not true.	1
"As a debt collector, I noticed a problem with the protection of landlords/property owners who are requesting internal DNC's with the company I have employment with. As they will be Do not call flagged ""DNC"" with one account, they will not be DNC'ed with another account for the purposes of skip tracing, the chance of repeat calls in urban centers harassing certain members of the public is plausible as the only numbers that are held consistently in the database afaik ""By Law"" are verified and confirmed numbers.

So, I'd like to go back to the original question. Yes, education is something very important, it is education that is at the heart of everything to change things. I have not thought about the level of aid money, I don't think, I'm not so naive to gavage - we can give aids and subsidies, but well, yes, it's very good if we have subsidies to be able to buy our bread, that's already that. But I think we need to give people net and not fish, so there you go, there should be job opportunities - how can we create job opportunities in our own countries?	0

"Exercise a control on immigration, on entering the territory. Or now not coming by boat or small boats. No, those who come by plane. There you can do a stretched control with the airplanes. A control like it is done in the U.S.: ""How long will you be here? Where are you going to live? For how long do you intend to be here? Fourteen days? A month, two months?"" And then checking where the person is when that period of time is up. That is strictly controlled there. I wouldn't say building barriers, but I would say a little bit more control, from the integration point of view. I would give them a test. They have to take an exam two years after they came to us to see whether they are integrated or not. They have to integrate themselves into the new culture. Languages, behaviors, habits, traditions. We need qualified immigrants, but qualified for what? What do we mean by a qualification here? Someone with a university degree, or with a certain diploma. A teacher would be useful, a doctor, but then again there are differences in legislation. In Germany, Spain, Denmark."	1
"Too many collectors call and never report the ""mini-Miranda warning"". They call all times of the day and night, and multiple times of the day. If they don't get you because your have called ID, they will change their ID and try again. It is simply harrassment. Many will challenge the the consumer, threaten, and even harrass them to the point that I saw someone actually contemplate suicide. Also, when a debt is sold, the information for the orginal details need to go with it. many times these collectors will call, and they have no details on debts that are 5 and 6 years old, and the consumer doesn't rememer it.

"The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) was passed by the United States Congress in 1991 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush as Public Law 102-243.

A word about political refugees, because none of them were saying that there is a difference, I'm detaching that. Political refugee is something special, as the name says it's someone who is fleeing a country where his life is in danger. Personally, I never mix these people with economic immigrants - they are voluntary people who leave their country voluntarily. On the other hand, a political refugee must be treated politically. So, in my opinion, here in Europe we are still treated differently. I agree that this is a problem that needs to be dealt with in a very clear way. - I would like to add one thing: Concerning immigration in general, we always talk about immigration but we do not know in Europe how many immigrants there are, we do not know anything. So we start the immigration policy with an evaluation of the number of immigrants: where they come from, who they are, what is their level. And from there, we can establish something coherent. Because we are talking about, we know, that they exist in our country, in France there are many of them, we don't know how many because it is forbidden to say it and from that moment on it is the words that won't say anything. I repeat, I have already said several times: First we need to do a general census in Europe, so by country, we have two million, three million, four million from such and such a country, from such and such a level and from that moment we can say something concrete, thank you.	0
Yes I think there is a problem and it is this, because we have to outline in any case how many immigrants we want for certain occupational groups and then you could try to translate that into numbers per country and look for such people who are actually needed.	0
When a debt collection company (Bayview) took over servicing of my mortgage, I began receiving phone calls at work and on my cell phone about my mortgage payments even thought they were not late. This included robo-calls. I was told this was 'standard' and to ignore these phone calls, but I really got angry and filed a BBB complaint in the state of one office. I was never late with one payment, and our mortgage was not in debt collection. Bayview may be a debt collector, but they need to keep those services separate from their mortgage services. Calling people at work, robo-calls, and harassing them when they do not have delinquent debts should be against the law.  	1
Compliance 2013 demonstrates the type of arrogance that I have been addressing in my prior comments. The belief that a default is a default by courts along with the practice of REWARDING Strategic Defaulters while sentencing INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS to never ending escalating debt because of the ongoing interest rate charges needs to be addressed. I have been researching consumer debt for the past few years  and Consumer Debt is ON THE RISE GLOBALLY, and that is not a good thing. Canadian finance expert warns about rising consumer debt. __URL__ I can replace Canada in the title with England, Australia, South Africa, China, Russia, Ireland and on and on and on. The consumer debt escalation is being caused by a ridiculously low 2% monthly minimum payment, the gateway drug to higher and higher debt, and because consumers who have legitimate life Changing events that cause them to default cannot plead INVOLUNTARY DEFAULT in court. We let criminals plead involuntary to many crimes, but not law abiding citizens when it comes to their credit cards and student loans!	1
I am not saying to give priority to such persons, but to give them a chance and do not discriminate when they are looking for a job. I think that such persons that cannot make it in a country will leave anyway and others will stay. It means that for them we need to create chances. Without preferring, but giving an equal chance. For equality of opportunity I mean. 	0
I believe people should be given psychoactive drugs that increases their productivity, like stimulants (Adderall, etc). CMV Apparently my original account got shadowbanned or something, so asking again: I remember seeing some posts in askreddit about ADHD medications, and I was amazed when people mentioned how they were able to get motivated and focus on many activities for hours they would otherwise find boring and soon quit, like studying or just trying to learn certain topics. I think one person read about how mechanical clocks worked and designed one for himself while on the drugs. Based on these evidences I think they can be used to make people learn more, like in schools and many other possible environments. And if people know more and are motivated to something productive this will likely lead to better society in general. I do realize potential side effects these drugs can bring, and how they can fuck people up both mentally physically if abused. Governmental regulation on usage of these drugs and help to people will help decrease these disastrous outcomes.	1
Verify needs to be thoroughly defined. It should be no less than documented court admissible evidence that the consumer is responsible for the debt. If the debt collector cannot produce this evidence, he should be barred from reselling the debt or reporting it to the CRAs.  	0
"With increased and onerous liability for making calls and sending letters to debtors, creditors and debt buyers have had little option but to file suit rather than repeatedly attempt to contact an uncooperative or uncommunicative debtor. Most complaints provide adequate and identifying information about the debt. In my experience, most debtors don't feel taken advantage of by lawsuits, they simply understand they owe the debt so there is little point in filing an answer or taking time to appear in court. In fact, the vast majority never respond to a Federal Law letter inviting them to dispute the debt. Filing suits and appearing in court is expensive and time consuming for creditors and debt buyer, but there is little alternative, nor should there be as these matters have always been governed appropriately by State law and State judges. and the US is a credit ecomony over 70% of our economy is based on consumer spending which comes mainly from credit extensions and not consumers pay increases), there are simply more defaults, particularly in a Great Recession. Any heavy handed Federal regulation will hamper and restrict credit granting and debt buying, both of which are needed by the economy and the credit industry. While credit grantors should should make their documentation retention systems more accessible and share more documents upon a sale of accounts, a lack of documentation should not hamper State court lawsuits when a debtor offers no dispute so long as the account is adequately identified in a complaint. In Michigan, efforts to ""make it more likely that consumers would defend themselves"" have fell very flat for the reasons mentioned above. As it has always been, the protections are in place and are used by those debtors that wish to avail themselves of them. Judges are there to listen. However, most debtors (bless them) understand they simply owe the debt.  "	0
I think, according to the last question, that when Polish people have a chance to go abroad they are taking this chance and going. They are having the same jobs which they could have in Poland but for better money. Then, of course somebody has to take these jobs in their country. That’s the reason why the immigrants are coming. They are taking the jobs which nobody else in Poland wants to take. Thank you.	0
I support Manuel's opinion because I think it's important for us as Europeans, we are already used to it anyway through the European association, that we also mix among ourselves. We are a very strong economic alliance and also a very strong cultural alliance that can withstand a lot and has withstood a lot in the past. I myself come from a socially deprived area in Hamburg, where I grew up, which means that I had the experience of growing up with Turks as a child. It is certainly a very personal experience, and I think that those who now realize that the third generation of Turks is now with us in Germany will only then realize that an adjustment, a cultural adjustment is only just beginning to happen here. That means that on the political level we have to create much more intelligent migration systems than what is currently being handled. This ghettoization must be stopped, because no immigration happens at all. We have had popular cases in Germany at schools, where not least because of missing migration systems [integration systems] always a lot of violence, a lot of aggressiveness is built up and above all the quality of school education suffers quite considerably. Therefore, we can actually only create a framework within the EU, where we also allow a distribution on all shoulders to take place on the one hand, but also on the other hand, we must all agree as Europeans on how we want to protect the overall borders of Europe against, on the one hand, against illegal immigration certainly also to some extent, but where we want to allow it. Because we have a lot of countries within the EU, which have very strong declines in birth rates, that is Germany, that is Italy, and I have now heard, in Spain I think also. That is, this balance must also take place for our benefit, that we maintain our population density as it is at the moment.	1
"The national database and licensing would be a good idea if it were used effectively to weed out the bad collectors and put them (and their corporate officers) out of business permanently. Not those who get caught up in technical violations over mini-Mirandas, but the ones who knowingly commit serious violations of the FDCPA, FCRA, and TCPA. As Tfleeman noted in his very insightful comment above, the ""private policing"" we have now has not been effective in stopping the worst abuses. As for the main topic of this page, I think it's far better for a collector to leave a voicemail (with clear identification of the caller and callee) than to call the same number 50 times without leaving a message. The rules should encourage this rather than frustrate it. So, I would favor option #1, with the mini-Miranda deferred until the collector is sure he is talking to the right person.  "	0
"Your point is understandable; however the statement you referred to is known as the mini-Miranda. This statement is a requirement in a debt collector's initial communication and in some states every communication). Typically, the validation verbiage is included in a sheet of it's own with several other disclosures a debt collector is required to provide. As far as law being slanted against the consumer, I would disagree. The laws surrounding contacting consumers and the information required to be given is quite stringent, the problem is the channels which are directly regulated by the law are outdated. The primary law that regulates a debt collector was written in the 70's and did not directly define that is thrown around all too often, harassment (among others). Because of this, if a debt collector sends a letter and makes a phone call, he may very well be held accountable in a court of law for ""harassment"". Most collectors settle out of court as defending a suit as frivolous as the one described above would cost much more than settling with a consumer.  "	0
"The Chinese is something that interests me a lot, because I was born in Asia. I was born in Asia, I am also an immigrant. Because when I came to France I was six years old. But the Chinese are one of the most important elements of immigration in the world, and in your country it may be very visible, but in Africa, we could also talk about Chinese immigration because it is an immigration that - I have the impression - we will not be able to control in the coming years. It is one of the two most populated countries in the world and they need to go elsewhere, but there is a very positive element of Chinese immigration that we have seen in France: When I was working in Paris, I was working next to the so-called ""China Town"" of Paris, the 3rd arrondissement, and I can tell you that in five years people went to restaurants much more than before and the restaurant habits have changed too much, because before the Chinese opened restaurants and well go to restaurants at lunchtime when we went out of work, It cost us twice as much as it does now and all the restaurants have transformed themselves to offer meals that are worth - that's what we call meal tickets that are distributed by the companies, so there's been something very positive in that but it represents, I completely agree, a global risk."	1
I also find the assertion that INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS don't put up a legal defense because they are afraid or have a lack of knowledge about the legal system to be outrageous. Strategic Defaulters save part of the money that could have gone to pay down their debts so they can give it to an attorney who may be able to get them a sweet pay off deal. INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS keep trying to make their monthly payments until the monthly accrual of interest rate charges and/or a life changing event forces then into an INVOLUNTARY DEFAULT. INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTS are not recognized by the courts. I had a SPOTLESS payment record for 15 years prior to a life changing event that caused me to become an unpaid CareGiver. If I could have been allowed to start with very small monthly payments to all of my creditors in exchange for having my phone lines left alone, I probably could have started making some income again. Instead, the constant debt collection phone calls forced me to convert my land lines to 20 cent a minute cell phones that I could not even afford to answer. I LOST work and contacts because debt collectors would not accept small monthly payments as a beginning pathway towards paying off my alleged debt. Probably the ongoing interest rate charges on default debt makes it unrealistic for debt collectors to accept small payments. Until alleged defaults are truly frozen so that those who want to pay them off have the best chance to do so, more and more debt will accrue.  	1
Creditors generally do not send accounts to collection until after they have sent multiple notices. Requiring a specific notice will expose small creditors to liability beyond any benefit to consumers.  	0

The main problem with this reasoning is that you're looking at the Beatles from our current perspective as opposed to looking at what they did from the perspective of someone who was around at the time. Other posters have discussed the technical advancements they ushered in, so instead I will try to explain the cultural impact they've had. When the Beatles entered the scene (I wasn't around at the time, so this is taken from anecdotal evidence), much of the popular music was akin to what the Beatles released on Please Please Me, their first release. It was practically unheard of (at the time) for artists to progress the way that the Beatles did. Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time, while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs. There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both [I Wanna Hold Your Hand]( and [Tomorrow Never Knows]( very different songs, I admit, and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large) in a way that is...natural. They progressed as opposed to mutated. Along with that comes the fact that bands like Radiohead would not have existed at the time (that is to say, experimental bands that still achieved large mainstream appeal) and would arguably never had achieved mainstream success or even existed were it not for the Beatles. They are widely considered trailblazers in this regard exactly because they did go there and by doing so paved the way for other bands to do what they did, only more so. Finally, there has never been a band that has had as big a cultural impact before and since. People would maybe argue Elvis in America, but I would personally put the Beatles above that. The simple fact that female fans would have genuine [manic episodes]( just from seeing the Beatles (something that did not happen before) says a lot. I also did some research on the cultural impact the Beatles had on Liverpool and London, and it is remarkable. // Along with that comes that, if you look purely at the quality of music that the Beatles produced you should be able to see that they have produced an enormous amount of arguably high quality music in a short time. And the other bands know it too. The Who stated they were highly influenced by the Beatles (and the Beatles by them in return, just listen to [Helter Skelter]( and I would argue that you can definitely hear some Beatles influences in both Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, albeit more subtle. They were way before their time in a way that no other band has been able to emulate, be it in musical quality, diversity of material, evolution, quality and volume of music produced in a short timespan, and mass appeal. There has simply not been a band that has been able to deliver this complete package in the way that the Beatles did.	1
On this story of - well, I don't (...) on everything that Gloria said, I think that if you say it, it's because truly, it's something that you felt this violence there, it's true that as Jean-Paul was saying, this type of discourse, comes to us in France as if we heard it thirty or forty years ago. We can still hear it, but in a certain way, there is, I don't say a demonization, but I think that there is a bit of caricature in it, but at the same time, there is surely also some feeling that I don't question, so - but to say that here, the immigrants come not to work, to abuse the social welfare, to go before the native Spaniards, not the native Frenchmen, go in a very very very... I think that the problems are perhaps more complicated than that. Now, what I also want to understand is that we have an immigration from the colonies, so, already, we have an immigration that spoke French. Whereas you, in fact, are on a passage and therefore...	0
"I respectfully disagree with your assessment. If anything, I believe that a national statute of limitations would actually stop the process of zombie debt. We live in a transient society. Assume that a national SOL were to be adapted"" Also, you did not address the issue of tolling. Again, we live in a transient society. People move from place to place. For example, I had a medical crisis in Illinois. I was not able to keep up with the debt. I moved back to my home state of Wisconsin in a town 25 miles away from the Illinois border. Now, because I live in Wisconsin, the SOL has passed and I can no longer be sued here. However, should I ever choose to move back to Illinois (which I can't unless I want my credit destroyed and want to get sued) it""s as though the debt never went away due to their tolling laws and longer SOL. It seems that the rationale behind your argument is to solely protect those people who live in states with short SOLs (3-4 years). That""s not even 50 %. A reasonable universal statute of limitations would make things more clear. At the very least, tolling provisions should be eliminated should states have their own statute of limitations.  "	1
"Well, you might want to try explaining why you think alcohol is bad in a little more detail, as I don't really have much to go off of here. Basically, alcohol in moderation is a tool for making certain experiences more enjoyable. There are different levels of intoxication. It's not like there's a threshold you cross where you go from coherent and coordinated to stumbling baboon. You can drink slowly and in moderation over the course of a night and just get enough alcohol in your system to have a ""Buzz"" going. It lowers your inhibitions enough to make you more talkative, so social situations are either more fun, or easier to stomach depending on your point of view. It produces a unique feeling which is enjoyable, so even if you're just watching Breaking Bad or reading a book by yourself it's still a fun activity. You're 16, so I'm not going to recommend you start drinking, that's against the law, but alcohol isn't really something to be fearful of. When you understand the effects of alcohol, if you're **responsible** about when you drink and how much you have, it is simply a tool to help you have a good time."	0
A debt collector did not litigate a credit card debt, but summarily garnished our joint checking account. It was two weeks later that notification was received from the debt collector.

It took several weeks including an Order from the Judge to release the funds, only after the Debt Collector took all of a tax refund.  	1
Yes I would like to contribute as well. We're talking here about the EU, about legislation, about controlling illegal immigration, etc. One moment [short pause] Yeah yeah yeah... Maybe you can start again? Yes.  So, illegal immigration. I see that the European Union is putting a lot on its own shoulders. When I see that there is so much unemployment in Andalusia and then there are also illegal immigrants coming, then of course the situation is deplorable. If I understand correctly, many immigrants also come from Muslim countries. But why don't the rich Muslims help, e.g. Arabia, they have money. Why don't they help them? Because we cannot solve everything in the EU alone. That's why I ask myself, why don't the rich Arab countries help? Because the EU takes over everything itself, carries everything on its own shoulder. And I would definitely advocate stricter border controls, so that it really becomes more and more difficult for illegal immigrants to come to Europe.	0
I don't think it's wrong for a girl to be slutty and promiscuous provided that she practises safe sex and birth control. CMV I don't see why women that have lots of sex (usually not with the same person) are looked down upon. Sex is something that all enjoy and that can be simply practiced for pleasure. As long as she or her partner use a condom,and she isn't cheating / sleeping with a person already in a relationship, I really don't see the problem.	0
. Obviously building businesses there is difficult, the intention is good but I think that in practice it is not very feasible. I think what we need to do is to talk to the people in charge of politics in Europe so that this - in a first phase try to establish order in these African countries, because what we are doing at the moment is not at all that and so what we really need to do is to give these people the possibility to feel comfortable in their own country, in their own continent and there I think that the European Union must absolutely do something.	0
"Karate student here. We have a few types of learning, and we learn the canned moves. We learn how to perfectly execute a shuto sakotsu uchi, a downward knife hand strike. We learn how to do a perfectly formed inside middle block. We even hold separate courses on ""street self-defense"", teaching how to get out of holds and what to do in what situation. However, when it comes to Kumite, fighting, all of that goes away. No one pays attention to proper form, they just block, strike, and dodge. But does this mean that all the technical learning didn't help? Not even close. I can't touch the black belts in Kumite, even the ones that are 5 years younger than me and have far shorter arms. No one is expected to perfectly execute what they're taught, but in being taught the canned moves, they learn what the moves should look like, how they work, and what they're supposed to do, and in that they can use them more effectively, in their own way, in real combat. While I may not bring my hand all the way up and strike exactly at the collarbone with a shuto sakotsu uchi, I'll certainly instinctively form my hand into the right position, bring my hand as high as time constraints allow me to do, and then strike more effectively at the area I know my strike will be most effective. None of that will be exactly proper form, just as you'll most likely never use the exact same moves that you see in those videos. But the things you do learn do allow you to know the general move, and utilize it for your purpose when you can. Watching a couple videos will obviously not be enough to give you an adequate measure of self-defense ability. But canned techniques, when adequately practiced, can definitely help in a real life situation."	1
"I had a 19 year old debt come back to haunt me I went to three attorney's to attempt to pay them to ""talk"" to the company, as the information I was given, would not call me back after leaving several messages, along with an offer to settle it for slightly more than one-half of what they claimed I owed. This debt went from around $1200 up to $9,300 in those 19 years. This type of behavior must be regulated it is only out and out a scam.  "	1

Yes I completely agree with what this gentleman just said because I think we have created ghettos, we have - at the moment - people who live very very badly, immigrants who live very very badly, who are already unemployed, who have enormous problems of integration and I think we should already make an effort to integrate these people who are well in our countries and then we see what we can do to bring in others, we must already take care of the people who are on our territory and who are living very badly and who are unemployed, who are poorly cared for, who have problems with their children, school problems, problems with papers and I think that we must already arrive once we have properly resolved these problems and that we will have sooner than bring people in and make them unhappy - I think that it is perhaps worse than doing something more moderate.	1
Personal experience maybe less, but wouldn't it be possible for the EU as a whole to sit down with those countries from which most refugees are currently coming to us, or are coming to the EU, in some kind of partnership discussion, and to see how problems can be solved?

And the EU could really go there and look to get in contact with such countries and see that this can be solved in some form of partnership.	0
As far as the discussion is concerned; we have been saying that within the EU, there are countries where the economic development is far lower than in other countries. That is why the EU funds could be invested in those less developed countries, in order to make their chances equal to everyone.

Verifying the debt by the collector is a must. I had an instance where the bill was sent to wrong address. After 6 months I got a call reg the debt. They mentioned only the amount and the service provider. when service provider was contacted they said already it is on collection and we're not helpful. i asked them to send the Bill to pay it off. Only more calls from collector started. After almost 6/7 requests to the collector the bill detail was sent . On verification with my bank statement I found out that the amount had been paid. When confronted both the collector and service provider did not bother to apologize for the mistake. It is a case of non verification.  	1
"How are they ""a complete and utter scam""? Who are getting conned? The producers are offering a product that they make, for a price that they set. The consumer are usually well aware of the huge markup vs the difference in performance, and they are paying for the brand, which is their conscious decision. Those who buy these luxury cars are (usually) people who can afford that extra luxury of having either a social status symbol like the Bentley or the Maserati. They know exactly what they are doing when they are buying the car, and they are fully aware of the fact that they are paying for a brand name."	0

"I am an experienced recipient of collection calls. As I have explained in another post here, I live in a fairly large metro area, and whenever anyone with my very common last name and first initial skips town without paying his/her bills, I'm the one who gets the calls from the debt collectors. I know that a call about ""an important business matter,"" is a call about a debt. I have received many of these kinds of calls. Whenever a debt collector calls me and leaves a message without a name, it doesn't take me very long to figure out that the call is from a debt collector. If the debt collector calls and leaves a name, that debt collector is revealing to me, an unrelated third party, that the individual has a debt in collection. I consider this to be a violation of the spirit of the FDCPA if not the letter. Whenever a debt collector calls me, I am burdened with the knowledge that I now know the name of someone else who has a debt in collection. I've gotten any number of the calls described in #4 telling me not to listen if I'm not the named individual. The big problem with that is that, one again, the name of a debtor is being revealed to me, and then there's the added dilemma of the fact that now my phone number has been programmed into a debt collector's robo dialer. When that happens, the calls continue to come. I always disobey the instructions and listen to the message. I then call the debt collector to report a case of mistaken identity. It's the only way to stop the calls. In all the collection calls I have gotten over the years, I have received only one message with the ""mini-Miranda"" warning. When I called the debt collector to report another case of mistaken identity I was connected with an individual in a call center in India. After I told the woman she had the wrong person, I thanked her for the ""mini-Miranda"" and she hung up on me. I don't have any answers, just lots of experience. I hope someone finds this information useful.  "	1
Have you looked into roguelikes? Like Brogue, DoomRL, Dungeon Stone Soup, Cataclysm, Dwarf Fortress. Dark Souls design is in part inspired by roguelikes, which also impart a sort deep tension and thrill from the high stakes permadeath. You may also consider that Dark Souls works under a different design philosophy than some other games, that they may seem childish because DS is all about challenge (and the beauty/experience of that), whereas other games will focus more about experience and interaction and just factor difficulty into that. Like for example, one of the most memorable moments in Fallout 3 is first exiting your tiny vault into the real world and your eyes have to adjust to the sunlight for the first time. It's like the game just drops you off into this massive world and is letting you know their is so much to explore and it's further reinforced by how tiny and restricted the vault seemed beforehand. The thrill of that has very little to do with challenge, but is trying to excite you with the concept of interaction instead. So to enjoy different games, you may have to come in with different expectations. Dark Souls is a masterpiece of game design, but is working under a different strategy to excite you than something like Bioshock Infinite, which is more genius in it's commentary on game choice and environment as opposed to difficulty.	0
One question: Before Poland joined the EU, the country already had some contact with neighbouring countries from the East. So now, when Poland is a member of EU: Did this somehow influence the economic relations with neighbouring countries, which you had before? 	1
In my opinion, illegal immigration does not concern Poland in such an extent, because for immigrants, countries of Western Europe are more attractive than those of Central and Eastern Europe. That is why I think, that the issue of illegal immigration should be discussed mostly by citizens of Western Europe.	0
Breaking a promise to pay isn't the same as breaking the law. We can't keep comparing criminal law to civil law because it's just not the same. But the item that's missing here is the legitimacy of interest. Forget about big banks for a minute, and think about borrowing money from a friend or neighbor. When you keep money that is rightfully owed to someone else, you damage him, because he doesn't have that money, which he could be investing (to increase it) or spending (to improve his quality of life). That's one of the reasons that interest exists to compensate someone for the loss of their money for a portion of time until it gets repaid. I'm not saying interest rates aren't excessive they certainly are unfortunately, that's a separate issue. But suspending interest all together and allowing a debtor to freeze the amount of his debt indefinitely, because he borrowed more than he could pay back and didn't plan for unexpected expenses.... I don't know anyone who would loan money under those terms, except for maybe Mom and Dad.  	0
I come back to what I said before. I think it is very important. It's from where do we want to? for this migration problem. to solve it, if it's a problem, of course. That first of all, as much as Europe does not have as many as separate countries. But as much as Europe. If we have to take a clear decision in the kind of ministry, development cooperation, as we have it in the Netherlands, that is the whole of Europe that does what is necessary to shout means so that the countries where these migratory flows come from, that we help them in an important way on the economic and political level. But this would not be possible only at the European level. And the isolated countries will perhaps have to let go a little more of the East at this level, so more [in the occupied] but rather at the European level.	0
"A collector contacting a consumer via email, voice mail, or text message should identify themselves and say what they are calling about (e.g. overdue ABC account) without details of amount, account #, etc. So what if a third party might possibly conclude this person has debt? Without details they still don't know anything. I personally never return any calls about ""an important business matter"": if you don't tell me who you are or what you are calling about, I consider it spam. If you call in good faith to clear up an outstanding balance for ABC company, then you should say so. It's the ones that are trying to scam consumers that give as little detail as possible in hope that someone panics and fills in the blanks for them.  "	1
I do not believe that it would have mattered. It seemed that the Attorney/debt collector was not looking for the actual debtor I believe that all that they were trying to do was to make a quick buck. They did a couple of shady things with this case. For a solution; the laws should be written so the common lay person can understand. If I had known that a validation request would not be considered I would not have wasted my time and paid even though it was NOT my debt.  	0
Firstly, as a side note: Obama upholds democratic-socialist platforms. While he is not by definition a socialist, he advocates for socialist variations of domestic policy, to varying extents. The real problem with your argument, while both reasonable and rational, comes in the last paragraph: &gt;Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom. This just isn't the case. Here's why. Economically, socialism doesn't allow for capital-based transactions, and directly opposes supply and demand based thinking. This means two key things: profits don't exist, and instead of valuing things via the market, products are valued by the amount of production it took to make them. Capital no longer exists. Ultimately, while companies would no longer enjoy profit margins, neither would the workers: revenue would be sufficient enough (theoretically, assuming Marx was wrong and that his Exploitation of the Worker and/or Alienation of the Worker from Products won't occur in a capital-based system) to continue operation and ensure workers receive the minimum sustenance they need to survive. Therefore, there *wouldn't* be liquid assets anywhere (Proving Marx wrong, see above). In fact, if there were, it would be because companies were proving Marx's predictions true and exploiting the workers. Additionally, on a less theoretical note, our budget is stretched historically thin. Federal debt is rising fast ( and many of the social programs will become more expensive as the baby boomers become older. As these programs' pricetags are set to only increase ( simultaneously increasing other programs will only, if under current budgeting, increase the mess further. Simply, there is no money left to create. Even so, if we raised the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and the funds that give into Medicare/Medicaid, the primary sufferers would be employers. This would lessen small business's ability to operate, and allow only big businesses to reign supreme, so to speak. Essentially, to respond to your argument: it is neither theoretically nor practically possible for us to adapt more Marxist/Socialist policies without hurting, to some extent, either workers or small business owners. It would only cause big business to profit more, and give them greater incentive (&amp; arguably, ability) to become (more) fraudulent and corrupt.	0
As a creditor collecting my own debt, I assert that by the time I move to litgation, I've exhausted all other forms of collection. I've talked to, emailed, and snail mailed the debtor. I've tried to negotiate a payment plan or settlement offer all to no avail. Litigation is our last attempt. Once we are litigation, we present our best case and let the debtor present their defense. My experience is that debtors don't participate in their defense out of either fear or lack of knowledge about the legal process. But the burden of educating the debtor shouldn't be put on the creditor's shoulders. If debtor's prefer to ignore the issue, then a default judgment is justified. There should be consequences to the inaction of the debtor.  	1
Yes. I fell onto hard times during a divorce and found out a few years ago that my dad (whom I haven't lived with for 20+ years) receives so many debt collection calls for me every day he quit answering his home phone. This is unacceptable. We cannot even figure out how they got his phone number because I never lived at that address at any point while I had those credit cards and he never co-signed any loans or credit cards with me. The only connection we can come up with is that my stepmom co-signed a short term furniture loan for me 20 years ago when I was just out of college and that maybe somehow her name is tied to my credit report in some way although I've never seen it on my credit reports. This is now 6 years after I went through my divorce and he told me a few months ago he still gets several calls per week for me from debt collectors. Personally, I don't think they should be allowed to call ANY number for more than 3 months without successful contact with the debtor. Clearly, they don't have proof they've got the right number and all they're doing by calling the same unverified number for 6 years is harrassing an innocent party.  	1
As disappointed as I am with current US government, its crime against humanity is nowhere near what Japanese did during WW2. CMV Some people on Reddit think an American (who they thought I was one of), has no moral upperhand to criticize what Imperial Japan did to Koreans and Chineses, because of Guantanamo Bay and drone attacks (something about how Americans elected the representatives who support both of these things) I think their implication is that Guantanamo Bay and drone attack are on the same level of crime against humanity as atrocious act of Imperial Japanese Army. If a Nazi sympathizer condemns what Imperial Japan did, then he/she has no moral upperhand. So, please change my view P.S. I'm not supporting neither GetMo or current use of drone attacks.	0
Schooling system in my country(Slovenia) is almost exactly as you described. Education is free from primary school all the way up to phd. Everything is funded by taxpayers money so basically the only thing you need to pay for are books and pens. While attending university you also get different benefits like tax reduction if you decide to work, coupons for lunch so you don't have to pay the full price for your meal, cheaper monthly tickets for public transport, etc. Schools with tuition do exist. However their courses haven't been tested yet so there is no guarantee you will get a job when you get the degree. On the other hand such a system has considerable amount of flaws. Many people decide to abuse it for years so they enroll in a university solely for benefits, therefore they don't actually attend classes. Because of the crisis the government can't spend the same amounts of money for education, so they decided to cut teachers salaries. Consequently many of them became overburdened with responsibilities and extremely unhappy with their position, which decreased the quality of education. Many people also study for professions that don't have any demand on the market. To sum up, free education may seem like a good idea, however it cost a lot of money for the government(ours is almost bankrupt) and decreases the quality of education for everyone.	0
There is also the big problem with the payment, with the salary. And someone who comes from outside, of course, works for a completely different wage and that's the next issue. And then we soften our unions and our wage policy and I don't know where that will lead.	0
Yes, it's needed, but it's overly complex. The whole thing is very complicated. Do you want to take into account the geographical regions, the economic situations in individual countries? The reality, that is then difficult to bring under one roof.	0
I can state from personal experience that when our savings ran out I became eligible for in home support services in which I as an unpaid caregiver could be paid a very modest amount (at minimum wage payment) because I was a caregiver. By being an in home CareGiver, I was saving the state a lot more money than it would cost to pay me a small amount every month via in home support services. I told this to all of my creditors, none of them cared. Then reality hit, my state agency that was supposed to help me obtain in home support services instead cast fear into both me and my parent by stating to me on the phone that whatever they paid me, they would file a lien on the home to get back if I outlived my parent. It turns out this application of the law did not apply to me. However the damage was done. I lost 1.75 years of eligibility and probably enough money to pay all of my vendors, and, I would have never had to prolong the default for more than a couple of months if any of my vendors had cared enough to just help me get through the process of applying for in home support services. But because judges have become so vindictive in their approach to credit card defaulters, judges have allowed the credit card companies to become LAZY at solving their own problems internally. Nobody helps, everybody simply self protects their own interests first and foremost.  	1
I think the US reaction to Snowden's leaks is far more unsettling than the information those leaks contained. CMV Big fucking deal: the NSA tracks my phone and email records. Technically, they are reserving the right and ability to spy on me without my knowing they have that capacity. I don't like this at all, but TBH, I'm not really that surprised. I think it is absolutely terrifying, however, that: 1. they tried to keep something so obvious a secret. I don't even understand why. it's not like public review of this program would even compromise it. 2. they are so pissed off at Snowden. I guess he did break the law, bigtime, but you have to be a real cunt to chase the guy who spilled the beans on such an awful program. EDIT: After reading these replies, my opinion generally stands. To wit--duh, they were checking out suspected terrorists' communicaitons; lame that they didn't use a warrant; the beef with Snowden is based more on embarrassment than an actual crime against our country--even if snowden did break the law. EDIT 2: Lots of people are referring to nasty wasty stuff that snowden hasn't leaked yet. That is possible, but based on these comments, seems speculative. Top voted comment to give me credible reason to believe Snowden really has some nasty wasty shit gets a delta (note: this is legit use of delta. seeing *credible* info would have significant impact on my opinion).	0
There are no defensible arguments for the existence of a god. CMV I'm not asking anyone to convert me or prove god exists. This is purely about the existence of any defensible argument for the existence of God. I haven't found or heard any argument for god that doesn't fail in its premises, or by a subtle case of special pleading or circular logic. Because of this I have trouble believing people who were not theistic from childhood, but decided later in life that the existence of god makes logical sense, and I'd rather not suddenly feel that someone is a bit dumb because I don't know of any sensible argument that they could have run across to convince them. Edit: Success, to /u/turole ! Tl:dr of the argument: To someone not versed in logic and theology, ontological and comsological arguments can be very convincing. They might not pick apart the arguments as heavily as I would, or it might not occur to them to pick apart the arguments. However, I should see this as a lack of theological or logical research/training/knowledge rather than seeing them as a little dumb. That is, ignorance is not stupidity.	1
My deceased daughter(she passed 2 years ago) had some debt. We continue to receive calls from debt collectors even after we have asked them not to call us anymore. My wife has filed complaints with the Oregon State Justice dept. to complain about the harrassment. Why can't these collectors do their research on the debtor, before they harrass the parents!!  	1
I can speak, I'm the son of immigrants. My father was Polish, he came to France in 1930 but he came to work, to integrate, he was naturalized right away, he respected our culture and everything and that's what I can say. We come to France to work and not to take advantage of social laws, that's all.	1
Calls to the workplace should not be permitted at all. Harassing the consumer at his her/workplace can come to the attention of the employer and get the consumer fired or limit advancement. The collector then does not get paid because of the collector's own egregious conduct.  	0
I think how can we organize development assistance more appropriately. Development aid a little bit like with the Marshall Plan at that time: the Americans saw that the Greeks were not using the money and the Americans stepped up and they did concrete things. That was the Marshall Plan.	1
"I think Dark Souls is the best game ever made and I cant really enjoy any other new games. Please CMV The title says it all, and I understand its rather specific. To me, Dark Souls has the perfect amount of challenge blended with in-depth character development in the most beautiful video game world Ive ever seen. The game doesn't necessarily have the best graphics possible, but the seamless design of the world and the gorgeous views make me say ""wow"" much more than a game like skyrim, farcry 3, bioshock infinite, or last of us does. Since Ive gotten into dark souls I havent been able to really enjoy any other RPG/ adventure games because they simply seem inadequate and childish in comparison to DS. This CMV applies more to new games than old ones, because I certainly still love the games I used to love such as Morrowind, Metroid Prime, Soul Calibur, etc. But dark souls made feel that new games have nothing innovative or redeemable in them. All FPS games seem pretty much the same to me with slight variations, and RPGs seem to just be getting more mainstream and accessible. I would like to get rid of this prejudice, because I really enjoy playing video games, I just haven't found a game I genuinely thought was a masterpiece since I've played dark souls. So please, CMV and maybe suggest some titles you think Id enjoy"	1
&gt;1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking). [According to the Prius wiki]( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs. Since I can't find a figure online, let's say the electric motor components (which are the major components for regenerative braking) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing. So 218 pounds out of a total of around [2900 lb curb weight]( puts ~7.5% more weight onto the vehicle. Not as much as one might think. (It's also the weight of a full grown adult, so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo. Yes, that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking. &gt;It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved **significantly** less stopping than the average driver makes. At steady speed highway driving, you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size/efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics. What you don't seem to be taking into account (or at least understating the importance of) is regenerative braking. 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking. Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [as much as 50%]( of that energy. For the sake of keeping things honest, let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient. See the importance of regenerative braking? Using Newton's 2nd law, we can estimate that to get up to speed, Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy (and fuel) than Non-Hybrid X, but then when they both stop, Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses. This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed (Newton's 1st law). Yes, weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road, but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all. So to summarize: Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids. Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids. So like I said before, unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving (and even then the highway better not be very busy), a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart.	1
I would argue that pirating a small artists music is quite often a good thing. The biggest problem that small groups is that the vast majority of them languish is obscurity. Typically a group will become successful after some lucky break which has typically come from record labels signing them. But now that lucky break could be their music going viral via piracy which can lead to success. Think of it this way, piracy can be free marketing for a group that is otherwise unknown. If however your main point is that your money is better spent on a small artist, then you are probably right.	0
Yeah so, I think the problem is a very big problem. It is that - I think that in Africa in particular since we are talking about this - the effects of globalization which - globalization has become only an economic globalization and I think that political power has lost a lot of its importance because the countries, the African leaders, for the most part, are people who are bought, and they are bought by economic powers. So, it would be necessary - I think - for the European Union among others to regain a political power, a real political will to deal with politics with political elected officials and not economic elected officials since the human problem is not an economic problem.	0
[In relation to] Serge-Henry's [SE] speech, I would like to react, but you have already said it in your second part. In fact I think that in the eyes of the - you took the example of the Africans - I think that Europe is a miracle, it's paradise for them and I think that to come back to the question of illegal immigrants, even if I agree with Claire [CLC] as she said before, there needs to be a certain basis of law and a certain framework where everyone can function. The first concern I have about illegal immigrants is that they don't have access to health services, education and that's where I see a serious problem of putting them in a situation, sometimes maybe even worse or even less certain than what they had at home.	0
I belive AA is only a temporary solution for alcholics. Not a healthy long term solution to treat addiction. CMV I came across this today on [Reddit]( . While most of the comments sympathize with giving the guy a damn drink, I find it very disappointing that a person dedicated to help alcohol addicts broke down and caved into his problem. This is usually what happens to these people who devote their entire lives to AA meetings and then all of a sudden stop. I've known people who are in AA. Someone in particular who has been going to meetings for 20 years once downright told me if she stopped, then she would go into a downhill spiral of abuse. The program to me seems that it strips away your will and makes people rely on dependence of being addicted to this program instead of alcohol. The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. This on one hand can be a great environment and a very welcoming community that some people need. However, it's not something that I believe is a healthy way to quit and stay sober. Also on a different note, for Non-Christians it can be very awkward because of the heavy influence god has on meetings.	1
The main problem with privacy is that we use the SS# for everything, so everything can be connected. That's been a bad idea since they started using it as a taxpayer i.d.

Returning to the immigration topic: I think that for example Poland is scared of immigrants because people are scared that they will take their jobs; that too many immigrants will come. This is mainly the Media’s and Polish government’s fault. They are saying that immigrants are criminals and that they are stealing. Of course, sometimes there will be one of them for example from the Post-Soviet country who came illegally and steals. The problem is that this one person will commit the crime and his whole nation is blamed for being thieves, killers and so on. Surely people in Poland are doing the same bad things: stealing, killing so we can not look at the immigrants from certain countries as bad people which we can not employ in Poland.	1
I would like to start with a question. I read this. And I just got it yesterday. So here it is, I'm going to go through it a little bit quickly. And what struck me, and maybe I didn't understand it well, is that immigration, and among other things, the measures that we are thinking of taking at the European level, often come up against a point: that of finances. Because everything that is decided on this point costs money, it seems to me. But I think that it is perhaps a [...] to think like this. When it is a global process, we can say, well we don't want to meet illegal immigration, okay. But immigration itself is a global process. And when we try to bring people here, who can indeed, find a job here in our country, so that or we give them that in the form of development cooperation in their country but somehow we [will] do something because at the global level, the problem will only grow anyway.	0

"Whoever tells you that is being irresponsible or has never taken anti-depressants. Xanex will give you that instant-calmness and serenity, and it can be addictive if you take it more than you have to. There are other drugs like it, but normal, run of the mill anti-depressants like Abilify and Prozac won't do that to you. It's not as if you feel happy all the time, but it allows you to be able to feel happy at all. Depression isn't always prolonged melancholy--the most debilitating part of depression, I've found, is not finding any joy in anything. Allowing your brain to feel positive sensations again is what I think should be the goal of taking anti-depressants. In short, I think your view of anti-depressants as happy-pills that make you magically better is just as warped as everyone else's view of depression in your town. Also, get a diagnosis from a therapist or psychiatrist before you say: ""I've been depressed."" Depressed isn't a feeling, it's a state of mind and it's much more debilitating than just feeling sad. It's extremely complex and taking a 10-point quiz online does not qualify you to say whether you're depressed or not. When you have to make the decision between feeling like a pile of shit and watching your life flow down the drain and taking a pill every day or every other day, the choice will become crystal clear. It's not an end-all-be-all--a lot of times, there's a reason you're depressed, but being unstuck by anti-depressants at least allows you to be able to work towards solving those issues."	0
As medical records become more digitized, I see no significant cost increase to debt collectors in passing on substantive info to debtors, although debt collectors are bound to say otherwise. My concern is that the cost to consumers of inadequate information is routinely underestimated or dismissed as trivial. When I worked with a non-profit in Alabama, I took part in an informational meeting on a program of federal assistance (Farmers Home Admin, IIRC) in securing access to home loans on affordable terms for low-income workers. One woman who was at the meeting spoke of having been denied access to the program because of a single blot on her credit record, namely an unpaid medical bill. She said she had not paid it because she could not determine what the charges were for, was unaware of any medical treatment she had not paid for, and could not get a straight answer from the debt collector. She decided the debt might be illegitimate and refused to pay. As a result she was excluded from access to a home loan. This is an example of a consumer on a limited income who was consistently disciplined about her finances and who should have had access to credit. I find it significant that it was a medical bill that tripped her up, placing her in a category in which even the FHA would not work with her. From this point, credit was only available to her at high cost if at all. I am confident that the rule I am suggesting would have led her to either pay the debt or dispute it formally on the basis of valid information. What it would not have done is to leave her to conclude that she was being scammed and refuse to pay at all. This anecdote (and I admit I only have anecdotal evidence) does suggest that legitimate credit agencies also stand to benefit by disclosing information that will persuade skeptical consumers that they do actually owe the debt.  	1
I think you should look closely at immigrants, see what they do, if they meet the conditions to become a citizen of a country. I agree with that completely. I fully agree with Udo, because I think to create principles and rules that are bound to be respected by immigrants, because nobody wants to welcome in their country somebody who wants to destroy or undermine their own country, so to speak. I think it would be a good way, you should maybe create a body that would review the different cases to see if the people in question really fit into this country and behave properly.	0
"It is smarter from a business manager's stand-point to keep employees happy while maintaining work output. The path of least resistance to achieve this, when dealing with smokers at least, is to let them have their smoke breaks and keep them in ""working condition"". Since you have shown that you don't need a smoke break, it wouldn't make any sense from that stand-point to let you take a break for no reason. You don't ""need"" one. I realize that does't sound fair, but look at it from the manager's perspective. We have worker A and B in a door hinge factory. They both work at the same pace, making the same amount of door hinges per hour. Worker A smokes; Worker B does not. Worker A gets irritable and is less motivated to work if he doesn't get his nicotine. So, the manager lets him/her take their smoke break so they can keep up efficiency. Even though there is a difference between Worker A and Worker B because B will make more hinges because they continue to work instead of smoking, that difference would be even greater if A was unhappy and couldn't get their smoke break, leading to even less door hinges because they weren't motivated. With regards to Worker B, why give them a break if they haven't expressed a need for one? Ain't broke don't fix it. And at the end of the day, it is probably easiest to give Worker A their smoke break so we have don't have to listen to them be a little bitch about their nicotine habit."	0
"Debt Neutrality Petition, you have made a lot of arguments in this thread about ""involuntary"" defaulters. However, the law doesn't make that distinction. Financial hardship is not a defense to someone's failure to repay a debt that he or she promised to  "	0
I'm aware of that, but I don't think many appellate courts have considered the issue. To confirm that it's the law, it should be included in a rule.  	0
Agree with RBell. Delinquent borrowers already almost always know they're delinquent so further notices are not productive. When notices are provided they should include the name of the original account holder and the full account number to establish a connection between any tier debt collector and the original account holder.  	0
Electoralism is rather a fact based on economics. Our citizens, obviously, care about the economy, perhaps in a more individual way. We are perhaps less affected by this economic globalization and this enlargement, 27 or 30 perhaps - the participation in the European election is finally very low. Without doubt, because the politicians themselves and the citizens who are elected, well, finally, do not ask themselves this question that we, basic citizens, think that they are going to bring to the firmament for which we hope for solutions.	0
Why does everyone think that Snowden's information indicates that the U.S. government is reading your e-mail? PRISM was not about data-mining, despite the original Greenwald article. The bigger story has been how terrible Greenwald's reporting was, and how ignorant of NSA operations Snowden actually is. PRISM's interaction with tech companies was no as a datamining technique, and it is not targeted toward American citizens. PRISM is, in a nutshell, a set of procedures to procure information from larger tech companies when complying with FISA warrants. Unless you have a FISA warrant out on your ass, OP, the NSA isn't reading your e-mail. And they don't know anything personally identifiable about you from phone records - they have non-personalized metadata from Verizon. They can seek a warrant and find out the *who* behind a particular communications device, but the information they have does not identify you.	0
"This is a fantastic idea. Right now, debt buyers buy debt for an average price of 4 cents on the dollar. Many debts are bought for 2-4 cents on the dollar and many other debts are given away for free. If I were an original creditor, would like to get the most money I could for a debt owed to me. And so if I could get 10 cents on the dollar directly from the debtor, rather than 4 cents on the dollar from a debt buyer, then I would see no reason not to offer a significantly reduced debt settlement rate to the debtor (or as you call it, letting consumers bid on their own debt). Right now, original creditors offer no significant reduced rate to debtor before selling for 4 cents on the dollar. Most creditors barely even offer debtors 10% off the debt as a settlement offer. Sure, a creditor could more quickly offload portfolios to debt buyers by selling them at 4 cents on the dollar. But creditors could also make way more money offering a onetime chance at 10 cents on the dollar (or something really attractive but still more than 4 cents on the dollar). Perhaps the CFPB should make a rule that allows consumers/debtors the chance to receive a onetime offer that is valid for only X amount of days (maybe 45 days) from the date of the letter sent from their creditors of a significantly reduced rate. The offer would only be valid for a short amount of time and would also inform the consumer that, should the consumer not accept the offer, the creditor would then turn it over to a debt buyer. This letter would only be sent if the creditor""s intentions are to sell the debt and not just another attempt to collect. So that this way it gives the consumer one final chance to clear the debt owed and the creditors also have less loss and more profits and would be able to lend to more consumers, give better rates to consumers, and stimulate the economy. Because more money that is changing hands at higher values (10 cents on the dollar vs. 4 cents on the dollar) instead of sitting in the accounts receivable section waiting to be collected (one day, if ever) stimulates the economy. This rule would not negatively impact anything (or anyone) and only positively impacts everyone. One minor impact might be on the debt collection industry possibly receiving less debt in their portfolios that they buy, but this minor impact is offset by the large positive impacts on the economy.

I think it is inevitable to distinguish between the immigrants within the EU and here all the issues should be regulated by the EU within its borders, because there will be some regions full of such immigrants. For those from the third countries who apply for asylum, here some countries have more lenient rules in comparison with other countries. I am afraid, that if we apply uniform law for all those countries, it may cause problems. 	0
This option doesn't make economic sense. Debt buyers do serve a practical purpose because they allow the creditor to unload a massive amount of debt at one time. The cost of negotiating individual deals with each of those 1 million delinquent consumers would negate the benefit they get from the consolidated offload. Debt buyers allow the creditors to clear their books, which enables the cycle of lending to continue. The transaction between those two entities doesn't change what is actually owed on the account.  	0
Yes I think that Europe can do - because quite often we talk in the - besides it was very interesting to see that people make problems of it in the sense that there are the gypsies, when we mix the gypsies with the immigrants, we can say that it's a word [?], it's the difference, the difference of many things that it is culture or good. But Europe, for immigration, I think in my opinion, there are many tracks to do, because when people come, people come in time - when I was young, to give the example - someone, an African came to study here in Europe - .	1
"I think the idea that we're ""babying"" kids about cyberbullying is a little misplaced. I got bullied a little bit too but only maybe 5% of it was physical- bullying is really a psychological game. Combine this with the fact that the internet is a shield some people use to say awful things they wouldn't even say in real life and you have a new vehicle for insulting and intimidation that kids haven't had to deal with before. I know it can be hard to accept it as ""valid"" because it's not the situation we dealt with as kids but you have to realize how much has changed in the way kids talk to each other now. Instead of having to wait until after lunch or the corner of the playground at recess where the teacher can't see, these kids have smartphones and can say hurtful things from anywhere, any time of the day. Instead of a kid getting called a faggot at school once or twice a day he's getting facebook messages about how he should go kill himself. Cyberbullying is not only a real thing, it's a much more extensive platform for bullying than kids have ever really had to deal with before."	1
Yes, listen. You have to put all this into perspective, you know. Development aid is a good thing, it's very important. At the same time, we have to think about two aspects. Most of the African states were part of the colonies of Europe, previously the colonies ? of Europe. Think about that aspect. And that's it. The second point is that the European economic system, in my opinion, does not want to respect other systems too much. It is always in their own interest. I'm thinking for example of taxes on products - look, if we start to slow down the products of these countries, well, at that point, naturally they always want to migrate. I don't think it's a serious political interest at the base, whether it's in Africa or whether it's in the United States. But we have to think about being more serious and more respectful.	0
A debt that is paid in full doesn't improve a credit score at all. A debt that is settled for less or paid in full is the exact same. Once the damage is done to a credit score, the damage will remain. The only slight (very small) improvement on a credit score is when a bad debt was a credit card account and had over 100% utilization. Once the utilization goes down below 100% (and that occurs when the credit card debt was either settled for less or paid in full) does the credit score improve only very slightly. But the damage is still done and will take years to recover from.   	0
As a college grad since 1979 and a first-time homebuyer, I have found widespread violations of the FDCPA among the creditors and their outsourced private collections agencies. I've also found and been a victim of deception in the debt collection practice observing poor record keeping on the part of all parties. We must first examine debt collection from a derivative and forensic viewpoint; corporate finance, federally/state funded institutions and their debt obligations. GAAP allows for the write-off of old debts. Yet and still the creditors outsource collection agencies to collect debts the creditor has written off of their balance sheet. The debtor is always subject to the debt because the collection agency takes a percentage Then comes the finance charge (interest) and late payment charges. In essence, the original debt remains the same because the debtor is only paying commission, interest and late charges. I attended a Texas private college (state funded) that lost its accreditation for mismanagement of funds. My financial aid consisted of the BEOG, NDSL, Stafford Loan and the Merit Scholarship. The school policy was to clear the balance of my bill before my grades were released. Each grade period, whatever the balance was, my Mom used the funds she had left from our Social Security Income (father deceased 1972) after paying monthly expenses to send to me for my grades to be released. After my marriage, the Dept of Ed (Higher Ed) offset two years of joint tax returns, private collection agencies constantly called. When I was employed, I voluntarily paid $50/mo. for two years on this debt of which the principle was $4,650. Even after over 30 yrs., the debt was recorded as a Federal Abstract of Judgement at the county registrar (filed by private attorneys) as if I still owe the debt. I wasn't properly served. The process server (whomever it was) left a large manila envelope. Now the debt has been turned over to the Dept. of Justice in the State of Michigan. My point is that there is a widespread conflict of interest among the creditor and those outsourced by the creditor for debt collection. Most, if not all of these organizations are operated by taxpayer funding. The taxpayers are the ultimate creditors.  	1
"As an ""authorized user"" who has no access to the actual credit card, my credit rating is suffering because the ""account holder"" presently, is only able to make the minimum monthly payments. I don't think this is fair and have not been able to get a direct response from anyone to see if card companies can legally do this when they collected no information from me but my name! There was NO FULL DISCLOSURE stating that as only being an ""authorized user"" said card company would report on my credit report.  "	1
I would also like to say something briefly about this, and I think it is very important that those who want to come to the country should learn the language, so that they can communicate with each other, so that they can explain, both the locals and those who come from outside, so that there are no misunderstandings, and both the country that accepts them has tasks, but also those who come in must try - or it should be absolutely necessary - to learn this language.	0
I wanted to complete what I just said. It was a question, it was not an opinion that I expressed. I wanted to understand better because many people talk about asylum seekers, which is regulated in a very detailed way in German law. You simply have to prove that you have been persecuted.

When the first collection agency can't collect they sell the debt to 2nd tier collectors. They sometimes sell it to 3rd tier collectors. My experience in helping resolve collection disputes is sometimes the first collector and always the third collectors do not provide debt validation letters.  	1
The reason ”How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?” is unacceptable is because not every answer a person with intellectual disabilities (the universally accepted description, for everyones information) is wrong. Sometimes they give correct answers, and not just because of luck! The people I work with try especially hard to learn and be correct when giving input. I know this was just an example, and you probably have many others in mind, but there *is* a difference between a blind person not being able to see (they can't), and a ”retard” not being able to answer anything right (they sometimes can't, just like you or I). For the record, the people I work with are apathetic to the ”r word”, in every sense. They are also aware that they have special needs, and would prefer if the public stop walking on eggshells trying to explain it in any other way. Does that mean you should go around palling around with the friendly retards at the YMCA like your best buds? Probably not :)	1
"Email rules allows hiding emails and routing them in ways that surpass any other communication method.

I agree that it benefits everyone when notice of sale or assignment is given to the consumer. I am not aware of any part of the industry other than mortgage servicers who presently give notice. The benefit is clear it reduces confusion, reduces the risk of misapplied/lost payments, and produces a clear chain of ownership. It would be costly to the creditors selling the debt, but not so much as to be prohibitive. Creditors have to send notices under a variety of other laws. I don't think this addition would make that much of a difference. I think the notice should state the account number, the entity to who it is being sold (including contact information) and the amount currently owed. It should be sent by the seller, who has the most current information for the consumer, and a copy should be provided to the debt buyer as part of the sale package.  	0
I am son of immigrants, third generation. We have lived in Greece for three generations. These distances will decrease more and more. And there will be more and more people who will choose another country of residence for various reasons, financial or otherwise. The problem is that Greeks want to impose their, for example, immigrants want to impose their own culture. Want to live their traditions and so on, as they did in their country of origin. And that to me is incorrect and contradictory. Because what is the point of living in another country and not adapting? And not adopting the ways of life of that country. Because at the end of the day you are accepted and you try to have a better life and you have the opportunity to work, to earn money.  [1010.mp3]  And so you have to respect the conditions of admission. And another issue is the issue of religion. That's a big issue. And it's also a big problem at the same time. Because there are different people who use religion to take fanatical positions. And that hinders progress on this earth. Meanwhile, there are still religious systems that prevent progress. And so you have to prevent this fanaticism and the developed countries have to set an example for this, because religion is something personal. And you have to give this message and that religion cannot contribute to the communication between people, but rather it divides people.	1
I see what you mean, but that tiny percentage suffers incredible annoyance and harassment. Should they pay what they don't owe, merely to get out from under? All we've ever asked for is an itemized bill from the original creditor, but the collectors act as if that's too much. And they say--and probably believe--that we've received other bills, but we haven't. We've lived in the same place for 30 years how awful it must be for people who move a lot.  	1
Insurance is the same as the extended warranty on appliances. You are paying more up front to prevent yourself financial disaster if something happened. Of Course the insurance companies are able to price premiums in a way they always stay profitable. You however get the benefit of piece of mind, knowing if the worst happens you are covered. Auto insurance is important because most people couldn't afford to pay a huge claim out of pocket and they also cover uninsured drivers hitting you. All insurance is probably considered negative lifetime equity, however they are important in helping people avoid financial disasters. One massive car accident, home fire or medical claim could bankrupt you and your family.	0
I had one debt collector in particular who called me a liar when I told him I wasn't the person he was looking for. This was after he violated the FDCPA by calling me at 7:00 on a Saturday morning. I called them back immediately and spoke with a supervisor who said she'd take me off their hit list. I asked her if she got my number out of the phone book. She claimed that they had not. A few months later, they started in on me again. Obviously they still considered me a liar. I sent them a cease-communication letter with a copy to my state's Attorney General, who has been wonderful in all this. At that point, I started sending out letters every time I received a collection call, and, other than the one, none ever called me again. At one point I was receiving daily calls from one collector or another. I can name names, and I have a thick file folder full of copies of my letters and responses to my Attorney General. It has been a wild ride, and I sure hope it's over. I'm approaching the one-year anniversary of my most recent collection call. I just wish they wouldn't use the phone book as their primary research tool.  	1
"The courts should also mandate that if a debtor has reached out to the creditor in an attempt to negotiate the creditor must continue to try to reach a settlement rather than seeking judgment against the debtor. Also, the collection agency should not be able to add interest on top of debt that seek judgment for if the debtor agrees to pay since they will make a profit over what they paid the original creditor. Basically these so called ""attorneys"" (just another form of ambulance chaser in my book) are just forcing bankruptcies upon people who would be willing to work a deal and then they and the courts and the government are whining about what the bankruptcies do to the economy and the bottom line. Last time I checked even in a court of law you can't play both sides.  "	0
Collectors are not calling me repeatedly because they don't believe me. They are calling me repeatedly because there are so many people with the same last name as me and one of my initials.

Stop trying to obsessively advocate for equality in gender specific situations. 1. **Function** Men and women are anatomically different. Women bathrooms have the necessary equipment to support the female anatomy, and male bathrooms have the necessary equipment (urinals) to support the male anatomy. 2. **Predation** It is overwhelmingly more likely for pedophiles to be the opposite gender as their victims than it is for them to be the same gender. Integrating public bathrooms makes it easier for child predators to prey on children. 3. **Privacy** One of the key elements of a bathroom is that it offers privacy. OP, would you support integrated locker rooms in public schools? Do you think that this would do more harm or good?	0

yeah, so. I've been looking at the statistics. And in Spain, you find that the increase in immigration also has a significant impact on the prison population in our country. So, for example, remand prison inmates or also criminal prison. And so, there are more immigrants in this than inmates from the national population. So 30 percent of immigrants were now in prison. So more than last year, by the way. Now, I don't have the exact numbers on that, of course, but there is a significant difference there between prisoners who are immigrants or our own. And you can see, so with the crisis, the number of immigrants who end up in prison then increases additionally.	1
The biggest issue is that all of the things you have listed are not primarily concerns for the general public of computer users. Ease of use and familiarity are the chief concerns and these are two metrics in which even the best Linux OS's fails spectacularly. Linux, if time is spent configuring it, can be great. Unfortunately most people will never take the time to do this and find the UI of the OS quite annoying and counter intuitive after 2 decades of exposure to windows. Clearly you are someone who is knowledgeable in computers so you see no problem in adapting to Linux use. Imagine having the headache you would receive teaching every member of your extended family how to operate Linux. Now expand that onto a population that isn't going to have a handy guide to hold their hand the whole way. Until Linux takes significant steps to adapt it's UI to a more user friendly design it will never receive more than a niche market share of OS's. Private citizens and businesses alike will be weary to adapt it until this problem is addressed.	0

"It almost sounds like you wish the word racism ended all arguments. The fact is that people will disagree over what constitutes racism in some cases, and when they're called out for being racist, will naturally defend themselves and deny being racist. Do you honestly expect people to just stop what they're doing whenever they hear the word ""racist""? It's much more helpful to have a conversation about why you think it's racist (which admittedly can be hard, because people get defensive about it) than to just cry racism and walk away. Case in point: someone in this thread disagreed that making fun of accents was racist, and you just called him out and said ""this is what I'm talking about right here, guys"" without explaining why it's racist. And I think the argument could be made, but you seem more interested in shaming the guy. This is what I really dislike about much far-left discourse: whoever is objecting to something is automatically in the right. But it doesn't work like that. It *is* possible to take offense too easily, and some accusations of racism *are* ridiculous. I've seen people accused of racism for simply bringing up what race someone was, in a context in which the person's race was relevant. Should people never deny being racist, even in cases like that? If there is any disagreement over what's racist--which is only natural--people who defend themselves will inevitably commit the infraction you dislike so strongly."	1
Preserving the industry DOES protect consumers. If there isn't a lawful and enforceable way of collecting money that is owed, then future consumers will pay the price in increased cost for credit, or denial of credit entirely due to risk.  	0
I would like to say that in Belgium, immigration has existed for a very long time. But especially Italians, because they came to make the minis. But in the end, they settled in Belgium. Those who arrive now in immigration, are people who imagine that in Belgium they are better off and they deprive, they separate from their families, hoping to have thousands and thousands more and this is not true. So I also say that the immigration now makes that there is much more unemployment, for the Belgians too. Because of that. That's my personal idea.	0
Speaking of legal immigration, I agree, as a function of each country - what each country will need. It is - I think - Europe that should set a quota, when a country - let's say Germany - needs immigrants there is a quota that has to be respected. Talking about the immigrants who are there: These people, I understand, I would also say that they are unhappy, them - why bring a body of other people who are still unhappy more than - that's what I find. I'm in a town next door that is also very dangerous, why? All these young men, they are the ones who burn cars, who we had really extreme cases and if we bring other people, those are still the bouquet. We have to respect a quota according to what each country needs. That's all.	1
"The case law related to this portion of the FDCPA has made it risky for collectors to include anything other than exactly what the FDCPA says. However, I don't think the law, as written, is easy to understand. For example - the first sentence says unless you dispute the debt, it will be considered valid (""dispute"" and ""valid"" aren't defined), but then goes on to say what the creditor will do if you notify them in writing. So if the consumer only disputes verbally, what rights do they have, if any? I think the law should be clarified, and then I think the CFPB should create a uniform ""Summary of Consumer Rights"" that can be required to be included with all initial letters from collectors. That way, debt collectors don't have to worry about overshadowing and trying to fit everything onto one page, or with the tricky area of providing legal advice by interpreting the FDCPA for the consumer. Also, consumers can get a consistent message from all collectors. If there is a concern about it being separate from the initial letter from the collector, there can be a mandatory one-line disclosure providing a link to a CFPB website with that Summary of Consumer Rights.

"As I frequent many of the consumer credit forums, I will tell you that most consumers do think that a debt can still be brought to court when the receive contact past the SOL. And others I have run into also still get contacted even after the 7 year mark when the debt has finally dropped from their credit report. In fact, just the debt dropping off from the reports that has otherwise been dormant will get an automatic response from debt collectors. It seems they purposely wait for it to drop off and then pounce to instill fear. As in a ""gentle"" reminder that they are still there. They act like sharks in the water circling their prey. And the consumers bring up questions like ""when will this end?"" and ""I thought the debt wipes out after 7 years, why are they still contacting me?"" Something needs to be done about this. SOL are SOL for a reason. Debt collectors should not be able to harass and harass and harass.  "	1
Regarding the question of how to make the illegals legal. We have a lot of undocumented migrants in Germany, as Alexandra just said. In Germany, some thousand of the people, relatives, so can be legalized - even after their visa has run out. And others can follow them, for example family members. But the question is what to do with these children? When, for example, the parents can continue to work illegally just to secure their jobs: What do we do with the children? Wouldn't it be better to at least legalize the children, send them to school, provide them with health insurance, and at least guarantee basic health benefits for women as well, and instead punish the person who for years has exploited these people and filled their pockets in a completely illegal way? And then people should say, well, I had an illegal job, and then the employers of these people should be punished very, very severely. And then, maybe we would have a lull.	1
I may not want to change your view about the volume problem, but I do want to change your opinion regarding who is at fault. Full disclosure, I have been working professionally as a sound engineer for 15 years. I'm not saying that the sound engineer is not also a part of the problem. The fault lies with many parties. As a sound engineer, I fight band stage volume on every band I work with. Many times I have a producer (who writes my paycheck) telling me to turn it up. The guitarist whose amp is turned up to eleven. The band manager who wants the whole thing turned up. The drummer. (Enough said.) And yes, many sound techs just turn it up because the sound system can get that loud, not realizing that there is a difference between can and should. I do the best I can to never mix bands anymore because it's not fun, it's just loud. Plus, I think it may be worse in the US here as there are no local regulations that I know of for volume limits as there can be in the UK. I hope you can see though that there are many factors involved in creating that sound, and that when a show is too loud, a lot of people can be to blame.	1
I feel that high-end luxury cars (Bentley, Rolls Royce, etc.) are a complete and utter scam. CMV For about $50k, you can get a car with a fairly powerful motor and a nice interior. Getting up to the $100k range, you get a very strong motor and a nice interior. However, I'm unable to understand the appeal of paying $500k or more for a car that, most likely, performs the same as a $50k car. When I look at luxury cars, I see...tan/cream-colored leather interior, a powerful motor, and that's it. I'm guessing that you're paying mostly for the little sticker that says the name of the car manufacturer instead of any actual benefit to the car. It could be the fact that I don't judge my worth by the things that I own, and I'm unable to understand the idea behind it. I imagine that lower-end Cadillacs and Buicks probably perform the same function at roughly a tenth of the price.	0

I agree with you exactly. That's the most important thing of all. But to give the kids a chance in the first place. The chance for the kids - let them learn the language and they flourish.

Kids who have had a chance to learn the language have come along like rockets in school. And there's no shame in learning the language first and then getting a good start. And not always being behind. That's the problem. The children don't speak the language at home, they have to be made strong in the respective language. And they don't make it if they just run along at school. That's what I have unfortunately, they went to school for four years and it didn't work out.	1
"Your point about the overshadowing is well taken. My comments are based upon suggested changes to the debt collection process. You are correct, if the FDCPA remained the way it is currently it may be considered a violation. The FDCPA allegedly is geared to the ""least sophisticated individual"". However, I currently speak to many people that are not able to properly respond to a debt validation (even when they have a credible dispute). I am currently dealing with a 72-year old woman whose son ""stole"" her identity. He was convicted of fraud and deported for other credit cards that he took out in her name. She received a dunning notice and now is being sued on another card that she was not even aware of. Our experiences are just different. I once felt the same way as you when I was in commercial debt collection. I truly appreciate your response but you and I will have to disagree that ""he or she should be able to articulate that dispute"". I enjoyed reading your well thought out response and look forward to the continued debate.  "	1
So we had already discussed that aspect so in terms of illegal migration we had said that we will need those people in the future. Now as far as illegal migration is concerned, we also have to try to find a solution. So I always come back to this point, so there are 27 member states in the European Union, there must be a possibility of approving a law that is supported by everyone, otherwise it cannot work, which I can understand very well. You know that in France and Germany the courts are overloaded. If we have to dismiss this whole case now, it could take years, we know that here too. So some trials take years and then it is necessary to decide if people can stay or not, it takes years and therefore these are also huge amounts of money that are used and well these financial means could also be used to better welcome these people so that they can be supported in their countries so that they do not come. So this is the important point, we must try to ensure that these people who want to come to us, that we try to help them on the spot. And then we have to discuss the form that should be given.	1
Even if the defendant is guilty, the defense attorney still has a duty to defend him: not for its own sake, but to keep the state's prosecution honest. Defense attorneys aren't protecting the guilty as much as they are protecting the Constitution and our judicial process. People need to be proven guilty based on the evidence. Prosecutors need to know that solid, factual evidence is the only reliable path to a conviction. The alternative is a government that can charge people at random and see what sticks. Imagine someone is brought to trial only on the strength of falsely planted evidence, then convicted because of statements made in confidence to an attorney. The state did not do its job. In fact, the state learns that planting evidence helps put the bad guys away-- even though there was originally no evidence that the suspect committed a crime. Maybe next week they plant the evidence in *your* car, and for whatever reason your attorney can't demonstrate reasonable doubt, and now you're going to prison for a crime you didn't commit. Keep in mind that a mere arrest can ruin a person's life: if you can't afford bail, you might sit in jail for *months* awaiting trial, losing your job and house in the process. As a sidenote, you're not only advocating the removal of attorney-client privilege, but several Constitutional principles including the right to avoid self-incrimination (5th amendment) and the right of the accused (including the guilty) to a competent defense. Also, the defendants comments would probably be inadmissible as hearsay even if attorney-client wasn't an issue.	0
I don't mean these newspapers - they shouldn't spread this - but that these are serious institutions, which also then make an effort to really bring truth across to the people and not just some flower dreams.	0
So, to talk about this important point, it's not culture, it's not religion, let's talk about the economy. What makes our country, and I'm talking about the lessons of France, is that they have a history of welcoming immigrants that is much older, much longer. We have only two percent of immigrants in our country and after ten percent (...) 15. In France, I don't know exactly. That's what I was talking about at the beginning, about the lessons we could learn from the French example. Regarding the question posed by the moderator, we are here at the heart of the problem. The feeling that many Spaniards share is that they have asked for a lot of immigrants, they have allowed [shared?] their territory with many immigrants with all those who wanted. And the problem now is that the immigrants have continued to arrive on the territory, while there is no more work. While for a period of time, finally, there is no problem, and therefore, it is normal obviously that there are groups of people who adapt better than others. When they come to work, there is no problem. And then, as it was said after the Second World War, the reception of the French of many immigrants for the reconstruction after the horrors of the war, so the problem is well that one. And the Togolese doctors arrive in France now, or in Belgium, I don't know, and now they can't find work. While we, in Spain, are looking for doctors who speak Spanish, obviously, so it is rather South Americans because simply in our country we must have doctors. So the problem is exclusively economic in the end. So maybe there should be a debate, maybe not now, but a debate of migration legislation on the basis of a distribution of wealth that finally exists at this time.	1
so we have to do our development aid together with the EU. Not every country its own development aid. It has to be planned and then it has to come from Brussels and then we have to help. The best example of how successful you can be in this is Poland. A few years ago, the Poles liked to come to Germany and we had the saying: just stolen, already in Poland. That's over now. The Poles have a very good economic upswing, we have a lot of Poles who work for us and they like to work for us and they also go back and some of them stay. And that is a striking example that if the peoples have a reasonable prospect to build up, then we have no problems with crime, with migration, they then go back to their countries, because they also want to have their homeland. And what I wanted to say about the Africans: most of them come as young men around the age of 20 or 25. For 20 years, they have learned to survive only by beating, the law of the strongest, theft, crime. And that brought them success. And if they have learned this for 25 years and now come to Europe, how are they supposed to get rid of this mentality so quickly? It's a struggle like among savages.	0
Minors are not normally eligible to enter contracts or take on the obligation of credit arrangements, so this would seem necessarily rare. Regardless, every effort should be made and maintained to protect consumers from mistaken disclosure of personal business.  	0
This is a violation of the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) and can be corrected quickly by the credit reporting agency. If the credit reporting agency refuses, there are many Consumer Protection Attorneys that would happily take this case on contingency. This type of violation normally never sees the inside of a court room. A letter from a well known CP Attorney will likely get awards and the prompt correction of the credit report.  	0
I'm concerned that the proposed rules are just a back door to allow Director Cordray to find out about my special toy collection. He has sent me writings demanding my special toy collection, and I'm afraid that now that he's Director of the CFPB, he's using his power to come after my favorite toy, Mr. Longblack.  	1
I don't think religious reasons are valid, for anything really, because religions are not based on reason. CMV A few premises so that people can discuss specific points: Most religions are based on faith. [Faith]( is not based on reason. Therefore most religions are not based on reason. So for someone to say they hold a particular view or want to do a certain thing for religious reasons is misleading because it's not because of 'reasons' that they hold that view but because of something else entirely, usually because they have faith in something, which by it's definition isn't reasonable. Whether or not we should have reasons behind our beliefs is entirely different, I just don't think there are such things as 'religious reasons'. Have fun.	0
I unfortunately don't have an opinion about setting a set number of quotas. I think you really have to make a difference, such as shares. There are for example immigrants where there is a real urgency of integration, these are people who do not even speak the language of the country, so that even if they wanted to, they could not integrate. And then the zero immigration, I think it is a completely unrealistic solution because for example the former communist countries still constitute a certain danger - we saw last year when the Russians entered Georgia for example. For example Chechnya is also a very dangerous place and especially the rich people from these former communist countries often live here, in Vienna at least. So they do their business from here and I think that zero immigration is not a solution at all. Moreover, it is not possible and for example in Ukraine we don't know at all how the development will continue, even the country could be divided in two so I don't think that in these countries, precisely ex-communist, the situation is already calm.	1
Yes in Denmark we follow the rules as they are set in the European countries, by the Commission in particular. But we have made some reservations on some of the elements that have been agreed upon.	1
Alcohol is bad, please don't let me grow up boring I'm 16 years old, and throughout my childhood my parents have been kind of pretty overprotective, not too much but eventually it resulted in me being fearful of smoking, any drugs, and alcohol. The two former I don't mind, I wouldn't by far like to be interested in smoking and/or doing drugs, but the latter is kind of worrying me - alcohol is pretty damn normal in society, and I can't grow up sipping cola always and everywhere. I'm afraid that alcohol will make drunk and eventually lose control of what I'm doing, and doing some extremely stupid stuff that I'll regret for ages. Also I'm afraid of any possible brain-damage. Someone please convince me that alcohol isn't bad. : FYI; Alcohol at 16 is legal in my country.	1
The entire point of collectors calling debtors at work is to intimidate and cause fear of loss of employment to the debtor and the practice should be outlawed unless the debtor opts in to receive calls there. Its well known that companies like Sallie Mae will continue to call debtors at work even after being told not to.  	0
There are so many workers from Poland and everywhere from Europe in Germany. These are not illegal immigrants and then we have enough. Who come to stab asparagus, who work everywhere. For example, they would be very welcome in the nursing care insurance. But the German state does not allow that. And I would still have a problem with legal immigration. I would be for it, after the reunification, after 20 years, we still have so many problems. And all those who wanted to come, we could try with a blue card. Just like America does. And then Mr. Schröder, the old chancellor, tried that, but it didn't work. Nobody came, right? That's how I see it, it wouldn't do any good. But these immigrants who take advantage of the social systems, who exploit the social systems, they would have to be recorded according to quotas in Germany. I would be in favor of that.	1
Yes, it's true, it's quite complex the question of aid and subsidies. Financial aid is very controversial or would be controversial, abuses are very possible, but I am convinced that Africa is not going to develop like that all by itself and they are not able to solve everything by themselves. I don't know, I don't know how much help there is, but well, I don't know, we should find another starting point. Concerning the question of education, yes, I am aware of this, I would even say: yes, come and learn with us, come and train with us, but in the end, go back home and help your compatriots to develop. But well, it's going to take time and I don't think you can require someone to go back after their studies either.	1
Belgium has an experience in this field, I think. Here we are talking about professions which fill some vacancies. For years, this situation has continued in our country. And for years we have been trying to train the workers. However, constantly, there is a lack of personnel in some industries. Secondly, it is hard to train unqualified person into an engineer. Currently, there has been a deficit in Belgium, and we needed about 1000 engineers. But where can we find them? There is a chance to find them in the EU, or import from beyond the Union. On the other hand however, we will never be able to turn an unqualified person into an engineer. There are also other professions where the situation looks the same.   	1
"* you think it's not a choice * you think genetic factors play a role * you think environmental factors play a role. I think you're struggling with the words and not with the concept.

"I think the issue you have identified here in this post is key - lack of financial literacy. So many people borrow money without reading contracts, without understanding the law, without considering the risks. We live in a society centered on immediate gratification, where people who can't afford things just charge them, thinking they'll pay it back later. But then something happens - a job loss, medical issues, unexpected expenses. So few people even maintain sufficient savings accounts these days, or put money away for retirement. If we really want to get to the heart of this issue, it has to start with education, and financial literacy. Now, I'm not saying the banks and lenders are innocent participants they have certainly taken advantage of the ""instant gratification"" mindset by extending credit with high interest rates and fees, knowing that someone somewhere will sign up for it. But they can't bear the brunt of the blame for societal ignorance.  "	0

I think that in Europe we have a great advantage since 65 years now live in peace, there are no more wars and it's not at all the case on other continents, especially in Africa it's due to the many wars that people lose all their existences, the basis of their existences, so they don't have the same possibilities as we do from the beginning and so what we have to do among other things is really try to change with our means the conditions there.	1
While I agree that this is not ideal (and I don't use the women only area at my gym at all), there are several good reasons that I can see for doing this. One is a public health tactic. Women are much less likely than men to get sufficient exercise. Exercise is an important protective behaviour for good health. The presence of men in the gym is a barrier for some women for exercising. So having some times where women can exercise without men present is likely to lead to improved health outcomes. Another is to provide a space for women whose cultural/religious beliefs mean that they can't effectively exercise in the gym with men present (imagine working out in hijab). In multi-cultural societies, this has a place.	1
Why do these ghettos actually form? It's not just that these immigrants are just coming at us, but maybe it's also because we're not coming at them. We always demand something from others and are not willing to give anything ourselves. Who likes to leave his home country? You can't assume that they are all just economic refugees. That will certainly apply to some of them, but I also believe that in our area, the necessary integration is lacking, that we partially approach these people.	0
Once companies have sold the debt to a collection agency they do not help resolve it in any way and the collection agency is only interested in getting money not whether the debt is real or there were some mitigating circumstances.  	0
I would have liked to talk about the subject before, how we moved on to another one. So, if we talk about selection, as far as nature is concerned, the selection that chooses the strongest men, the most robust, that means we have to put them out of all this because if not, we won't be able to do it. Because in the end, none of the [pain?] comes from there. But now on the previous subject. I completely understand what (...) meant. It is that there is no reciprocity between countries. Yes, you can receive it from abroad, but as a consequence in their country you should do the same thing. So a [minimum?] culture means that everyone adapts, that everyone does what they want; we are a democracy. But we have to adapt because we go to their country, it's not the same thing. And so yes, there has to be some form of selection.	0
"If a bank is going to sell a consumer's debt, the bank should be required to notify that consumer IN ADVANCE, and allow that consumer a fair chance to bid on and purchase his/her own debt, on terms just as favorable as the terms offered to any other debt buyer (which at present is usually pennies on the dollar). Debt buyers contribute nothing to society. Yet, they are allowed to obtain windfall profits by pursuing impoverished consumers for the full face value of such debts. This proposal would entail changes more extensive that just ""notice"" as it would require a change from bulk loan sales, to requiring an opportunity to purchase individual loan in certain circumstances.

"I think that the CFPB should come up with a regulation that prohibits a creditor, and a debt collector, from sending the debt for collection to another debt collection company AFTER a consumer disputes the debt, or sends a ""cease and desist"" letter to the debt collection agency. In my cases that I worked on, a ""cease and desist"" letter was sent to both the debt collector and original creditor requesting that they cease collecting the debt as per the FDCPA. However, all they do is close out one debt collection company and send the account to another one. Then the consumer has to repeat the process. The CFPB should come up with a regulation that states once the debt is disputed or a ""cease and desist"" letter is sent to the debt collector, THAT debt collector must advise the original creditor that a C&D letter was sent.

A fetus requires a lot of resources from the woman's body which it acquires through the placenta. A large part of the placenta is the woman's body which induces a lot of change. So if it helps, think of pro choice as choosing whether or not to maintain a part of your own body: the placenta.	0

Monogamy is meaningful to many people. It's a symbol of commitment to each other. I don't have sex with other people, not because my husband is controlling or possessive, but because I've promised not to have sex with anyone but him. If I did and he got upset, it would be because I've broken that promise. It would be the same in reverse. Relationships are frequently about commitments to each other. It makes me happy that my husband and I have something so special that we don't share it with anyone else. The fact that we don't have sex with other brings us closer together. It wouldn't make either of us happy to cheapen that. And ultimately, if people are happy being monogamous, who are you to tell them that they shouldn't be?	1
Should assimilation be conducted? Is it worth talking about it? When someone can live in a society, copes, goes shopping, talks with neighbours; is this not enough? Isn’t it assimilation in a way? I think that is sufficient.  	0
I would like to react to what Rudolf said. Rudolf, I think you're right, but it also means not to do selective immigration as we're talking about now, it's to pull the brains out of these countries. And I think that spending about 1 percent of the BIP on development aid would be cheaper than putting in place an expensive border protection policy. If we manage to [dig up?] the sources of illegal immigration, that would be better than deporting people.  [will noch einen zweiten Punkt aufführen, hat ihn aber vergessen]	0

I feel like Superman is the most Mary Sueish hero, and I do not understand his popularity. CMV. Superman, to me, encompasses perfection. He's strong, fast, can fly, has pretty much every power under the sun that's textbook superhero fare, a very specific, and hackneyed weakness. His villains are generally more interesting than he is, but unlike Batman, who in my opinion acts more like a foil for the villains to be more pronounced on, Superman just allows any character his villains have to bounce off his chiseled countenance as he effortlessly pounds them into the ground. Yet every time a game featuring him comes around, he's perfect, every time a movie comes around, generally he's perfect. Hell, even in the most recent iteration, it took someone who was EXACTLY the same as him to even stand a remote chance against Superman in combat. He doesn't even have a power source that can be disabled (the Red Sun), so he's always super powerful when he's on Earth or in the Solar System, which is almost all the time. He feels like the most uncreative hero ever, but he's loved by EVERYONE, and I simply do not understand why.	0
Unfortunately, I think that democracies are unable to make effective border controls. It seems to me that in history the only countries that have managed to have effective border controls were dictatorships. And especially to prevent people from leaving, rather than entering. But to prevent them, even though in apartheid South Africa, and the neighboring countries, even though it was [...] racist and so on, the standard of living is still a bit higher. So, it's amazing, people wanted to go to South Africa anyway. I think that, so people will dream of an El Dorado like that. Democratic countries will never succeed. Because to be effective, they would have to use anti-democratic systems. And Europe so far is a democracy. And besides, in one of the arguments of the file, they put well that there will always be many who will be able to pass through the mayors. Channels or not.	0
I totally agree with Walerian. If there are laws, they must be respected. Even the Minister of Immigration, a few months ago when there were all these associations that wanted the legalization of all illegals, but no we are a man...of rights, we have laws and we will respect them. But secondly, to come back to Andrée, it was even a measure that may be well thought out but in practice it is completely unreal because precisely what he said, and everyone knows it, you [drive] them out, they come back the other way. And it costs millions and millions for nothing, a plane, the four police officers that bring them back to Nigeria or whatever country they come from and maybe we can find a way to spend those millions more efficiently than with the return of the immigrants.	0
Email isn't easier to access or view off the debtor's screen than a call a call's content is actually harder to hide if you receive it among other people), text message or SMS. The way regulation should handle sensitive information is by mandating that some information be an attachment, or in a link provided in the email, rather than the body of an email. If the attachment is encrypted or details are stored on a secured web page, no one will be able to access them. In fact, they will be much better protected than any other information relayed to the debtor. Work emails should be handled differently, much like calls to a work place, which can also be accessed by the employer.  	0
I think we have to slowly approach the discussion in a focused way obviously but so we always have to take into consideration the social aspect, if someone wants to come to us, okay but we also have people who are already in our countries so - integration of people who come, who have their problems - so they have to come to us and they also have to be able to live with our system and we who live in our countries, we have to be able and ready to accept these people. So yes, the man as merchandise has been said; it's not good, it's not right but we also have people living in the country who sometimes also have engouasses, who are afraid to lose their job, who are afraid because their children might have problems and so on. So this is also part of the points discussed in the questionnaire because this is also the point that we discussed, so how are we going to try to manage all this? So I wouldn't say that I'm against the principle of welcoming people who would like to come to us, who have problems, who are in danger, but we have to ask, how can we welcome these people? Are we all ready to welcome these people? That's also another point.	0
Consumers should not incur additional costs for cell phone calls, texting or voice messaging in relation to collections. The more costs assessed to a debtor, the less money they have to pay their creditors. Debt collectors and creditors should be required to stop all modes of communication to a device that the debtor indicates does not provide free communications whether calls or texts.  	0
Yeah, for orientation[?] I just wanted to share something. I'm hearing a lot of things here, I think it's going to be very difficult to generalize. Europe-wide.

"Items 1 through 10 should all be provided on the validation notice. Number 10 specifically should include the Date-of-service or DOS for the medical debt. Many consumers do not realize that medical debt goes to collections just like any other consumer debt. They mistakenly believe that their insurance company will resolve the issue. Also with extensive medical bills ( inpatient surgical stay) consumers have professional bills from each physician ( radiology, pathology, etc) in addition to technical component bills for the facility. Many times the consumer never sees these medical providers and either mistakes the bill for another aspect of the service rendered or, again, just assumes the bill/debt will ""be taken care of"". additionally the name of the consumer's insurance Co./plan on the validation notice would be quite helpful. This may seem to be a great deal of extra information but the originating physician and/or facility obtain this information at the time of or prior to service.  "	0
I think that charging different demographics different rates on car insurance is unjust. CMV. As an 18 year old guy, I get charged an astronomical rate for car insurance. I am a conscientious and safe driver and have never gotten a ticket or gotten in an accident. I don't think it's fair to make me pay significantly more money than other people just because of my age. I understand that young men are the most likely demographic to get into an accident, but that does not warrant discriminating against every individual in the group. We understand that a cop treating a black man differently than a white man is wrong, even though the black man has a statistically higher chance of committing a crime than a white man in many areas. I believe this logic should be applied to insurance rates. Anyway, CMV.	1
"I do not believe that it is ""just"" to allow a third party to buy a past due debt and sue for the entire balance, plus attorney fees, court costs, and other fees associated with ""mediators or arbitrators"". I believe that a third party debt buyer should be limited as to how much they can sue for above their initial investment. Too many times the original creditor is a publically traded company and the loss has already been taken by the share holders. Then some debt buyer buys a portfolio of un-performing debt and pays a dime on a dollar for it. Sends all of it to a ""law office"" to collect 100% or more of the original alleged obligation. The debt buyer should not be able to sue for 900% of their investment. They should be limited to a percentage of true damage. I know of no other civil process where this would be considered ethical.

"Just like mortgage servicers are required to send ""goodbye letters"" (a notification of when loan has been sold) and ""hello letters"" (a notification of when another company is buying a debt), so also should debt collectors. Also, they should be required to disclose the amount for which they bought the debt... the discounted price. Also, there needs to be full disclosure as to who is buying the debt along with the disclosure of the owners of the debt collection company and the street address of the company so face-to-face meetings can be arranged. Full transparency and full disclosure should be required related to any company trying to collect debt.  "	0
Of course the nazi's behaviour is a display of human natural behaviour as they were, in fact, human. Anything done by humans is human nature. Which is to say, humanity's nature is to be extremely plastic. It can be capable of horrifying violence or extremely pacifistic. It can be capable of incredible destruction to a scale not seen by any other living organism in the same way it can choose to be protective of other beings that would have no chance of survival without it's presence. Saying that humans are by defintion brutal, just because of this, is quite shortsighted.	0
If consumers can receive phone calls on Sundays, there's no reason for them to not accept emails.

Many people are coming to other countries not just because of economic reasons. Often, they are persecuted in their own countries on the religious grounds and they are trying to find asylum in another country. Then, the government should give them political asylum, papers or right of permanent residency and then they can work. For example Germany is rich enough to give jobs for immigrants and integrate them in the society because the society is aging and somebody has to work for the new generation which would like to get future pensions or something like that. Society is aging so they need immigrants. Similar to Poland where the government should legalize immigrants in a similar way. It is hard to say how it actually should look like.	0
I would have to point out that there is many complaints in regards to how abusive or harassing debt collectors are according to consumers. As a third-party debt collector, I receive dozens harassment complaints daily. I would just like to note that 80% of the time, these consumers that my fellow co-workers and I come across, are complaining of harassment and abuse; and 100% of them are truly just unwilling to face the facts. That's what they are complaining about. When we tell them that they owe a debt, they consider it harassment and abuse. They just don't want to hear their problems. Yes, grant it, there are some debt collectors that are harassing and abusive, but the other 98% are just pointing out the truth. When consumers realize that it is them and not us, debt collectors would receive a better reputation. But until then, we are the enemy in the consumer's eyes.  	1
Well, I hope I make myself understood. The economic aspect obviously needs to be discussed, but first I want to answer my colleague [AL]. It's true that well, [we are] from Africa or Latin America but the Pyrenees? now we cross the whole of Europe, there is a lot of immigration everywhere in Europe and that would not have stayed in our country anymore. Now they go to Spain, why? They certainly have their reasons. It's not as much to talk about today, but Spain is full. And since we are now talking about the economy, I believe that it would have had indeed a distribution of wealth. But as the resources now are scarce, and as everything finally comes out of the middle class, since everything comes from our taxes. And now, of course, Europe is having problems. But in the end, Europe is us, it is Spain, it is those who pay, the middle classes, and as we are going very, very badly, and so in the end it is the last straw. We cannot offer and offer, and finally, on the back of those who have to pay. You can't pay more and I don't know if you are ready to pay more but I think that for the majority it is not the case. Obviously, when there is a surplus, everything is fine. There is no racism, I am delighted. Now, since we're talking about the money and taxes that we pay, obviously, the situation? becomes unbearable, that's it.	0
"Let me explain it this way: Perhaps you're thinking of Superheroes too narrowly. Perhaps you're thinking that most Superhero stories go along the lines of this: Bad guy appears, Superhero beats bad guy. That's just about the most boring storyline structure ever. And that's the problem with your analysis: you think that a Superhero is defined by how he fights the bad guy. Let me present you an alternative view of why Superman is so appealing: He is our fantasy of justice. He's our fantasy answering the question: What if ""good"" were endowed with Superpowers? Given all the evil and terrible things in the world we live in, *what if* there were some really good guy that represents all our greatest hopes for humanity, with Superpowers that can put *everything* right. Grant Morrison put it in a much better way than I ever could: &gt;So we chose not to deconstruct the superhero but to take him at face value, as a fiction that was trying to tell us something wonderful about ourselves. Somewhere, in our darkest night, we made up the story of a man who will never let us down [...] &gt;Because it all derived from Superman. I mean, I love all the characters, but Superman is just this perfect human pop-culture distillation of a really basic idea. He's a good guy. He loves us. He will not stop in defending us. How beautiful is that? He's like a sci-fi Jesus. He'll never let you down. And only in fiction can that guy actually exist, because real guys will always let you down one way or another. We actually made up an idea that beautiful. That's just cool to me. We made a little paper universe where all of the above is true. We don't want to see Superman struggle (physically). We want to see him win. We want to see him save people, smile, and fly off to solve some other problem. We want to see him beat the crap out of evil aliens, and effortlessly round up the most dangerous of criminals. We want to see good triumph over evil. Superman is basically Jesus. He's God in the sense of omnipotence and in the sense of the greatest good, having just enough humanity to connect and make sense to us. That last bit is really important: the fact that deep down, he's just good ol' Clark Kent, raised on the farm with the best of parents, wants to help everyone, and *just happens to have superpowers* reminds us that we have that goodness within us. Humanity is also capable of that level of good and charity. So, now that we've established that Superman is no ordinary Superhero, let's answer your question: What makes an interesting Superman story. The answer is: not one where he can beat the bad guy physically. I'll give you an example. In Red Son: Superman is raised in Soviet Russia instead of America, and basically tries to altruistically take over the world and spread communism. [spoiler]And he easily does so. He restrains himself as he hopes that people will realize how much better Communism is (as ruled by an altrustic Superman), but over time he decides he just needs to take the reins, until Lex forces him to realize that he's basically playing god and humanity no longer has any agency. He ultimately realizes that he must let humanity choose its own way.[/spoiler] Alternatively, ""Luthor"" is a pretty good Superman story too. Except it barely even stars Superman saving the day. It revolves around Luthor's genuine fear that Superman, in being this godlike figure on Earth, completely cripples mankind's ability to progress because they see this *alien*, faster, stronger, more capable than they'll *ever* be, and there's nothing left for them to do. Luthor and Superman represent two different ideals of humanity. Superman vs. the Ubermensch (Lex). Whereas Luthor represents the peak capability of humanity (Lex is at peak human intelligence and presumably physical training, at the forefront of business, technology and politics, and a complete master of his own fate), Superman represents the greatest good in humanity (accentuated by the fact that he has godly powers but uses them altruistically). Now, what's a bad Superman story? I don't know, the Death of Superman or something. Oh look, it's Superman, fighting this monster that's stronger than Superman. Greaaaat storyline guys. If you want to read a story about a guy with gadgets or some cool power fighting cool villains, look elsewhere, at Batman or Green Lantern of Iron Man or something. Superman is much more endearing and enduring because he's now about fights and monsters, he's about the grand vision and greatest hopes of humanity. In his best stories, you walk away believing that some great moral principle has been won (or lost, depending on the story). tl;dr: Superman isn't your generic Superhero, who just needs to fight a bad guy and save the day. He's better thought of as a concept. And his best comics don't involve Superhero fighting Supervillain, they involve the ideas behind Superman and the ideas behind his villain clashing."	0
Debt collectors continuously resell the debt to other debt collectors who start the clock all over again. Then that debt collector resells the debt and the 3rd debt collector restarts the clock again, and so on. The burden of proof is put on the consumer to prove it is an old debt. The credit reporting agencies don't automatically remove old debts nor do they check to see if a newly reported debt is in fact a 9 year old debt that has been resold numerous times. The credit agencies (CRA) are more of a problem for consumers than the debt collectors. The CRAs are paid by the credit card companies and the credit card companies have bigger profits when they can charge higher rates based on poor credit scores. So there is inherently a huge conflict of interest here. If the CRAs can keep our credit scores down the card companies can make more money and don't mind paying the CRAs a piece of the action. Seems like unspoken collusion to me.  	0
* Autism is a spectrum disorder. Many people on the spectrum live typical lives, have degrees, careers, get married, and have families. There is no objective boundary of where you go from low functioning to high functioning autism. Additionally, it hasn't been determined whether autism is hereditary. Most research seems to indicate it is more likely environmental. * Downs syndrome is a mutation that causes sterility, so people with downs syndrome don't have children, and there is no genetic cause for it. * There are many types of intellectual disabilities, but the most common ones are not caused by genetic factors. In fact, the most common cause for intellectual disabilities is probably fetal alcohol syndrome. * People need to have the right to bodily autonomy. Forcing a person to undergo surgery against their will would probably violate our constitution's right to privacy. * This type of approach has been tried before, and it has always led to major human rights violations. The most well-known example is the Nazis. They forcibly sterilized all kinds of disabled people, including thousands of deaf people, who used to be considered intellectually disabled. * I think it's important when you're forming an opinion about something, especially where the stakes are so high, to do some research about how the experts feel about it. In this case, disability rights advocates are the ones who know the issues surrounding this question. They understand the needs of individuals with disabilities. Almost universally, disability rights advocates do not believe in forced sterilization. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people believe it, it's necessarily right, but it is a factor to consider when deciding how to feel about the subject.	0
"1. My face looks better with a beard. That is a matter of preference. 2. Initially I started because I was too lazy to shave, then I got used to having facial hair, then it felt weird without any facial hair. 3. I also dont like long gandalf style beards, I dont think most people do, but a well-groomed, short beard looks nice on most people. There is nothing gross about it, unless there are food particles and/or dead things in there, it shouldn't elicit a 'gross' response. 4. A lot of time insecurities about beards stem from ones own incapability of growing a proper beard. I don't know, maybe its a subconscious dislike of beards since you don't like your own. 4. Also there is the common stigma of beards being associated with pride and ""manliness"" in some cases its true as men are the only ones that can grow beards, but most of the time its not a primary reason for having a beard."	1
Yes, in fact I note that - the question rather that I ask myself is, at the moment to integrate the countries in the European Union, on subjects as important and as strong as immigration or in the same way what we will see later on global warming, I wonder about the fact of building a Europe that is bigger and bigger in surface, in countries, in member states, which leads to a diversity of important opinions as well as the mathematical greeting, we are fifteen around the table and it is necessarily more difficult to agree with fifteen than with two or three. So, on an issue as important as immigration, in the end, I am even a little surprised that three countries could not be signatories to an agreement. Whereas, for me, when we enter a group, upstream, we try to see if at least on the subjects that are important and that will define a very important state in the decades to come, we try to see - it's perhaps not necessarily so obvious, it's easier to say it, we try to see if at least the country corresponds to a trend even global or approximate common policy.	0
Can one treat it as an article or good? I do not know. I think that each country has a right to their own growth and development, and the European example cannot be imposed on any other country, as it has a right to its own growth and rhythm. In my opinion building a democracy requires much patience and time.  	0
"I don't think limiting the time to call a person at work is an option. Everyone works at different times. Some people moves, change cell phone numbers , so call them at work is sometimes the only option. It's hard to know what place ""prefers"" no personal calls , and a list could be an option, but most people work for smaller company's and the lists will cater to the large company's. Most people have information about where they work somewhere on the web. I don't see a problem if a debt collector calls a customer at work if they don't know prior of any inconvenience.  "	0
I would like to respond to the fact that people say that immigrants should stay in their own country. In fact, this goes against what we are currently saying to young people, to students with the Erasmus program. We say that there must be exchange, cultural exchange, and therefore we encourage all young people to leave, to study and to settle in other countries. So, why not? People who are elsewhere, even if they would not have the desire to come, I think it is legitimate to have the desire to leave, to expatriate themselves - if it is a wish, why not? Why would you want to keep people in their country? On the other hand, it is true that at the political level, things should be done so that there are commitments from countries that have the means to help young people who want to stay to study, to improve their living conditions.	0
"The current penalty for violating the FDCPA is ""not less than $100 and up to $1000."" Further, the violations cannot be ""stacked"" so those violating the law 10 times on one debt, will generally only face the maximum of a $1000 penalty. Punitive damages are hard to prove. A $1000 penalty is not a deterrent to the debt collection industry,and too low to get most attorney's interest is taking these cases. If we want to see the law upheld, raise the penalty to $10,000 per violation and you'll see most of these characters clean up their act and stop using abusive collection tactics.  "	0
"As a recovering alcoholic, I hope I can shed some light on the subject. It's not uncommon to run into what they call ""dry drunks"" in the meetings. People who have essentially replaced one addiction with another, albeit a much healthier one (being ""addicted"" to being in AA vs. being addicted to the drink). One of the main tenets of any 12-step program is the need for character change. I find the program, at times, to rely heavily on semantics, and I don't live my life by all their rules. I have, however, found a lot of help and wisdom and insight from the people in the rooms. There was an episode of Elementary where he says something like (I'm paraphrasing), ""I don't mistake the ethos of the program for a guide to living"". &gt;The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. As a recovering alcoholic, I feel that you are grossly misinformed with this line. This isn't true. The urges, for me, and I can *only* speak for me, subsided greatly over time. I don't wake up thinking about drinking anymore. Some days, I don't think about it at all. Most days, actually. And when I do, like right now, I can remove myself emotionally from wanting a drink. I don't want one. It all comes down to choice. I've seen the phrase will-power in this thread, and it leads me to believe that people don't have a clear understanding of the AA Program. It clearly states, and I agree, that willpower will not work for the addict. I had to get to a point where I didn't WANT to drink, just like I no longer want to smoke. It's not me depriving myself of something I want. It's me living a better, cleaner, happier, healthier life. &gt;Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. I see these people all the time. And, in my mind, they're not doing it ""right"". I don't feel helpless without the program and I don't feel like I lack control *TODAY*. But if I had a drink, any drink, at any time, I do doubt my ability to stop drinking. I don't want to get into the notion of the disease of addiction. I can only say that once I start drinking, I'm damn near powerless stop. BUT, and this is where I disagree with the program, at least semantically, only I can have the power to not drink. I make that call. No one holds a gun to my head and forces me to drink. It's my choice. It ALL comes down to choice for me. I'm a non-Christian and, I'm not gonna lie, some meetings get really god-heavy. But I've come to realize that I don't know everything, and that a Higher Power can simply mean something bigger than me. When I went to rehab, angry and bitter and knowing everything, I made a friend who was a pretty hardcore Christian. She knew I didn't believe in god, and on our last day she made me a card that said ""It's important to believe in something bigger than us"". And on the inside there was a picture of an elephant and it read ""I believe in elephants"". That was my jumping-off point. The mind of an addict is tricky and twisted. AA, and other programs, give the addict the ability to sort that shit out in a safe, welcoming environment. Did I work all the steps? No. And I don't know if I ever will. But I learned coping mechanisms and insights into myself and the world around me that have allowed me to keep feeding the good wolf, as they say. There are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy sessions and tools that also work. But we can't put everyone in a box. AA works for someone who wants it work. Who embraces that it does come down to choice. I can't say AA is the only thing that's kept me sober. But it's helped a lot. Sorry for the wall of text - my first post in this subreddit. I hope I'm doing it right. EDIT: I forgot to address OP's question about ""solution"" to addiction. In my mind, and the mind of many addicts, there is no cure. It can be arrested, but it will always be there. I will be an addict for life. It's not something I believe can be cured. Just treated."	1
The score hiding may not effect the order with which the comments are displayed over all but in threads, which are really the purpose of this sub-reddit as they denote discussion, it is actually incredibly useful in ensuring people remain unbiased. Far too often around reddit I see 'performance debates' where one speaker accumulates a great amount of upvotes and the other a great amount of downvotes. This causes people to gloss over the latter and simply read the first as they believe it to be the 'good' one. As we want people to read both sides of the argument and decide for themselves before giving upvotes I believe the Score Hiding system is actually very useful.	1
I think that in Poland fear of immigration does not come at some point from the immigration. Mainly because there are not that many immigrants in Poland. People’s fear comes from acknowledge of strangers[?]. This is natural that when people do not know something they are scare of it.  They are scared that somebody can take their jobs away or be less paid. Fear is the problem, not immigrants. In our country at the moment there are too few immigrants to create any problem. Thank you.	0
I just wanted to say that language is a very important factor in integration. One of the most important. And I also think that it's a matter of give and take. That the immigrants don't just have to be willing from let's say [again] also to learn the language and secondly to integrate and not just always make demands that the state, whether it's Germany or Spain, pay for them.	0

I believe that cheating is acceptable in the high stress environment that students are placed in today because of higher requirements for entry to college and more and more pressure from society. CMV I am a senior in high school, and while I dont cheat, I can see why people do it and I don't really have a problem with it. I live in California, and the kids at my school take 5-6 AP classes junior year and senior year. They pay large amounts of money for SAT prep classes, and other resources like this. When every kid at your school is so far ahead, an average student who works hard to get B's is left behind and can't keep up. So they might resort to cheating to keep up with them. And I feel that this is justified because it can be really unfair for those who work their asses off to get that B, only to have their application to a better college rejected because people keep pushing this envelope of cramming more and more AP classes into their schedule. So when it comes down to it in my opinion, when someone's hardest and best effort wont get them somewhere because of the unfair competition they face, cheating is justified. thanks in advance for your replies! Edit: I also just realized that this may seem an immature position because I'm a high school senior-but I hope to get some good discussion about this! Thanks again	1
"A benefit you're missing: (Or, alternately, a cost to having the religious symbols): The symbols placed there/supported by gov't are alienating those that don't share those beliefs, especially if the gov't says ""yes, religion X can have its symbols there, but not religion Y, and definitely none for atheists"" A school that emphasizes that it's ""one nation under god"" is telling non religious (or, say, polytheistic students) ""you're a second class person here. This is one nation under _GOD_, and you're an unamerican poopyhead if you don't accept The One God"" That's a nontrivial cost indeed. Further, it tells _others_ that it's okay to alienate those people."	0
It's not only about problems in Africa, there are also in Iraq for example, there has been a war and the EU is partly responsible. There are four million people in Iraq who have left their country, it is a political problem, and the EU has followed the U.S., has followed George Bush, and one should not forget Afghanistan. Because neither Iraq or Afghanistan can solve the problems, because there is still bombing going on, there is the Taliban coming up again, and it is also a political responsibility of the EU. I am for Europe but, listen, I realize that there are mistakes. We are also responsible for the mistakes that we have made. Italy, France, Greece, all the European countries, our political leaders, what are they doing? They bring up war-and what if they then attack Iran? If they then attack Iran.	1
I don't think that dropping my Gifted 10th Grade Literature class for a regular english class is a bad idea. CMV I'm a Sophomore who finished Freshman year with As and Bs (with two gifted classes, Literature and Biology) I only learned I had this class the first day of school and did none of the required summer work because of this. ( I have until labor day to read two books, do two essays, and do two projects) A very significant Girl (to me) is in this class and I only have one other period with her and she is the only reason I haven't dropped it yet. I would actually like to have this class, but the amount of work being piled on me is really stressing me out and it's only the first week of school. So, uh. CMV?	1
Here, I would also like to say something about assimilation because from one hand we can not require people to be our clones, wear the same clothes, believe in the same things and talk the same languages all the time. In my opinion they should keep their own culture, identity, religion and so on. Of course it is worth for them to learn their new country’s language to function well in the society, but they do not need to be exactly like all of us. So they can have their own morals. However, there is also a problem: How should we fight against prejudices for example in the case of Muslim people. For example woman’s role and other stuff in Islam scares me. I know that it is irrational because they are normal people like we but anyway their culture is completely strange for me. In the case of Europe, we all have similar origins and we are sharing similar values in which we all grew up. So it does not matter if we are in Spain or Ukraine because we understand the mentality of a certain country, this is so called the European mentality. But Muslim mentality is completely different and we should learn it. I would like to ask a question; How convincing people to not have irrational prejudices? I think that I am a person with healthy thinking and I would like to treat all immigrants equally but somewhere inside of me I can not do that.	0
I also wanted to say that I agree with Jürgen. In the 70's there was a dictatorship in Spain and at that time there was a lack of work, so a lot of people went to Germany. A friend of mine went there for example and culturally - or France, there were many Spaniards - and now he has a pension, he worked in Munich for a long time and he also worked at the streetcar in Munich and he lived his life there, he has his children there, he lives there and then he moved to Frankfurt sometime in between, but he integrated and at a time when he was asked. And he has cleaned plates in restaurants and done all kinds of things, but depending on the development of the economic situation and his adaptation, he has naturalized there and now it has been better for him to stay in Germany than to come back to Spain. Well, what Jürgen said about the politicians who don't dare to say things that the people think, or maybe even the majority thinks, we have to see how semantically that can be delivered; how can you work to make sure that there are things that are negative, or sound negative, without it immediately sounding like discrimination when that is mentioned? There you have to ask yourself if people would be interested in what people think, otherwise you just behave demagogically and then you don't represent the people. I think what Jürgen said; which is really very important to me, the politicians don't listen, don't want to know what the people want. We are not represented. There are so common opinions - I don't remember your name - but people come to us because they have to. They are in a state where they need that. If you live in Senegal and you are starving, you try to find a way out. And we have to understand that what we offer them is really something great. But now we don't offer anything to anyone. And then what do they get? Then they become beggars, or thieves, or something else. We just have to see what kind of people there are in the country, where they come from everywhere, and their children. These people will be the first who will never find a job, because they are not integrated, culturally speaking, and they will be marginalized. What are we going to do with those people then? I don't think they're going to turn into very much.	1

In fact, it is a gross distortion of the law for the CFPB to claim that suit on a debt outside of the statute of limitations period is per se unfair, deceptive or misleading. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (and most state civil rules), the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded by the defendant; if it is not, the defense is considered to have been waived. The purpose of the defense is to enable a party to avoid being disadvantaged by the long delay, loss of evidentiary documents, memory fading, etc.; if the debtor doesn't claim that they are disadvantaged by the delay, then the delay clearly isn't so long as to preclude a vigorous defense.  	0
"Notification that a debt is being sold would be ideal as it would afford the debtor the opportunity to negotiate the amount and possibly assist in thwarting any potential negative reporting on one's credit report. If a debtor is afforded the opportunity to negotiate his or her debt for a reasonable amount, perhaps the selling and reselling of debt may be marginalized. More and more consumers have emails and other modes of communication and therefore, it would be in the best interest of all parties to amicably resolve issues. However, should the dispute not be quelled, reasonable arrangements should be afforded to the debtor. Debts as assets is an outrageous concept and it behooves both the debtor and the creditor to ""work-it-out"". That is in the best interest of all. It begins with information, communication and resolution.  "	0
Well, yes, I understand that there are political options, in which I can find myself. It's true, but I also find myself in the arguments against.

Blocking caller ID information is disingenuous to say the least. Most consumers won't respond to blocked numbers or ID's anyway. Collectors should be required to identify themselves and to provide caller ID information that identifies them. Most people who cannot pay their bills are aware of the problem, so being reminded under false pretenses is more of an annoyance than a solution to the problem.  	0
"I don't believe in any kind of afterlife, CMV To start with, I'll say that I do think of myself as atheist but I honestly do not care whether or not any god(s), deity(/ies), creator(s), etc. exist. **I'm specifically interested in the existence of some sort of afterlife, or some existence of the essence of myself (meaning a sense of self, a personality, maybe some level of memory) after my eventual death.** I feel that because the brain and the body are our sources of the sense of self, our memories, our evolving personality, all of our emotions and sensations, that the death of our brain means the total absence of what we identify as a particular someone. **Why I want to CMV** I'm terrified of mortality and have been ever since I first realized I was going to die. I frequently get flashes of fear when I realize it's all real and I'm actually going to disappear one day, but most of the time I'm in a fairly comfortable denial about it (where I acknowledge its factual truth, but I'm not in an actual panic). **What I have already considered** I have already read all the quotes about how we're lucky to have just be born, how we won't exist to experience it so there is nothing to be afraid of, that it is the same as before we were born and there was nothing troubling then so it shouldn't trouble us now, etc. I know that ""energy isn't created or destroyed."" I have read [""You Want a Physicist to Speak at your Funeral""]( I know that immortality could eventually become torture. I agree with euthanasia. I know there are reasons why people might prefer death. I know that having a limited amount of time makes it all more meaningful and beautiful. I know that I shouldn't worry about the inevitable, but should instead make use of the time I have. I know that there are ways to support science in their pursuit of longer lifespans, I know about cryonics, the idea of the singularity. I have read Andy Weir's ""The Egg"" (which was a good story). I list these things just so the comments don't fill up with this sort of answer, because I've feared death as long as I can remember and have found all of these ways to cope myself. I have thought carefully about each. I have tried to believe in various forms of afterlife, with my favorites being some sort of calming heaven-like existence (as described best on Buffy the Vampire Slayer-- *""Wherever I was, I was happy. At peace. I knew that everyone I cared about was all right. I knew it. Time didn't mean anything, nothing had form, but I was still me, you know? And I was warm and I was loved and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about theology or dimensions, or any of it really. But I think I was in heaven.""* ) and reincarnation where you get to be born as any living sentience throughout the universe(s?). I think if I could get myself to believe in either, it would be a great comfort. I'm not interested at all in any organized religions. I've looked into Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Wicca (mostly through friends) and though I can respect most religions and admire the way they bring comfort, they are not for me. I don't wish to be convinced of any particular doctrine of faith, nor do I think I could be at this point. **TL;DR Section** I don't actually want anyone to convince me of any specific afterlife. I don't want anyone to convince me why having no afterlife is actually okay. **I want someone to convince me that some form of afterlife might be possible. Convince me (if you can, scientifically) that there is at least a *chance*.** Please CMV. It would bring me great comfort.

What immigration are we talking about? Legal or illegal immigration? Because if it is illegal immigration, it is true that it leads to dramatic situations. So I think, I'm thinking in particular of France, where there are already problems of reception, many French people don't have housing and have particular problems, notably unemployment, and obviously, illegal immigration contributes to worsening all that.	1

so I was talking about that. Benjamin said we have to distinguish between illegal immigration and legal immigration. I don't think we need to distinguish. Everybody who goes to another country has a right to do that, right? I don't think there should be countries at all, by the way. I am a citizen of the world. And if there is nothing to eat and nothing to drink somewhere, then you are allowed to go somewhere else. If there's nothing in Spain, then I would go somewhere else, wouldn't I?	0
Yes. I also have another opinion on that. I agree with the gentleman [HA] opposite. I think that the EU rules have to be unified, but there have to be some nuances and some reservations depending. Each country has its own needs again according to the traditions of its own country and also according to the requirements on the part of the officials and other officials. By the way, in the questionnaire that we filled out, there was also an opportunity to give a value, 3 4 5 6. It is difficult, sometimes not so easy to give a correct rating. Concerning the immigration problem, if we include it in a social analysis, we might be enthusiastic, but we also have to consider the economic side. There is not only the social aspect, but also the economic aspect. And these two things are not always classified equally, but both should be taken into account. And then the answer could be different, 4, 5, 6, depending on which criterion you choose as a basis or reference for the evaluation.	0
Periodically (probably when the debt has been sold) I receive harassing phone calls from collection companies regarding a believed debt that my nephew owes. I send him Christmas cards annually, see him at family gatherings every 5 years or so, and stopped contacting him about this harassment after he assured me it had already been taken care of when I received my first call. These calls happen about once a year for a couple weeks at a time.  	1
Barbara, if I'm not mistaken, had just spoken about black-skinned immigrants from Africa, who also have to adapt to the conditions in Poland, and there are also non-profit associations for this purpose, which are committed to this and which are helpful in integrating or adapting to Poland.	0
Should one punish people who e.g. refurbish individuals’ houses in Holland? I am just asking myself a question whether those in Holland, who employ Polish workers to refurbish their houses, should be punished too? Well, I do not know. I think the same situation is in Belgium, where Poles come to refurbish the apartments. Of course, if there is an occasion to choose a cheaper service, everyone thinks about their own wallets. So I do not agree that illegal immigrants are working for businesses, unless these are big companies – here penalties are necessary, but not when it comes to such a small case. I think that each one of us did something like that, so we had not always acted legally. 	0
[... ... ... ...] in Europe there is no immigration policy anymore, it does not exist. In Europe now, we have networks of people who provide us with people. We can say that an immigrant - so-called - pays 5000 dollars, a poor person. In Europe we don't have a migration policy at all like in Canada or in the United States, why? This is a question, it was good, that Madam - you have a heart, so do I. I would give anything, but you can't leave your compatriots, your family, your children down there and put someone in their place. You have to be honest, you have to do something clear, honest first of all with your compatriots, our compatriots are the Europeans. The problem we are experiencing today is that people are not attached to cultures at all. I can live in Germany, I can live in England, in Finland, in Sweden, by all - you don't see me ? Because I share everything you do. And someone who comes to us - I'm not mean, I'm not the racist - I have black friends, I have Muslim friends, they tell me the same thing: You don't accept - the chance is minimum, your policy does not exist.	0
Unless the consumer chooses to communicate by phone, all correspondences from collectors should go through mail. This allows the consumer to take time in considering what the collector is requesting. It also avoids confusion for both parties. The only reason this isn't the standard approach is because it limits how annoying and embarrassing collectors can be--plain and simple.  	0
Yes indeed, although in reality it is a vicious circle because the immigrants will be more and more. If the recession will end, the quota system will be unable to create, but either way it will not be a long-term solution. Social problems exist. Anyway, there is just too little money for that.	0
I'm a tennis player so I'm going to use that as an analogy. In tennis, we often times practice new techniques with slow, hand-fed balls. A coach will stand close and toss a ball easily up for us to hit. This gives the player additional time to process and understand their technique. For instance, if I were to learn a forehand from scratch I wouldn't want to go out and just start hitting it. This would leave me open to the possibility that I would do it incorrectly before the proper swing was ingrained in my head/body. I think a lot of these training videos operate on somewhat the same principle. Sure you'll probably never be attacked in *exactly* the same manner that they are demonstrating, but that's not the point. The point is that in learning some basic principles in a controlled environment you can begin to develop the skills necessary for real-life situations. The guy in the video isn't suggesting that if you just watch that video you'll be ok to go out and win any street fight, so I think you're misinterpreting the purpose.	1
So that's why I can't get away with it as easily as I had hoped. On the immigration issue - for me it's [...]. There are a lot of illegal immigrants working here, so a lot of Hungarians are losing their jobs because there is no cooperation between the labor companies, but in Hungary it's reaching such a level that it's actually quite dramatic. It has been 15 years since the pensions and wages have been increased. At the moment in Hungary, I would say that one euro equals 1 kilo of bread. An average salary equals 400 Euros - well, we manage to make the [...] with that, but it is almost impossible. I think that we ourselves need help. I'm not saying that immigration should be repressed - well, I'm not the one who's going to tell the European Union the solution to immigration, but there should be measures, I must say.	0
I also think that the press has a tendency to always give negative information about immigration and when there are events it is exaggerated - and in a certain sense sensationalized. But there's not much talk about what's working well, what's working well - that's quite natural. And I think that this is a great danger when we talk about this subject.	0
What I would like to say is that beyond the need for competence in health, we may need people trained abroad because we have not trained enough doctors, it's something we see every day, it's nurses, it's the same thing, but it's problematic to plunder the intellectual resources of other countries. It seems to me that the problem is more our need today, because I believe that it is a need in Europe. This need of immigration it is also linked to the demographic one that is nevertheless aging. And on the fact that we also need a young population, a population that needs to work, that is in plain labor force. To also generate contributions that will be used for our future pensions to be able to live correctly during our retirement. There is not only economic diversion, there are not only questions of competence, there is also a real problem of demography in Europe, so I think there is a need in Europe for a percentage of immigration. So that raises other problems and also questions but isn't it as simple, this taboo diversion that we don't discuss enough.	0
Yes, and what I meant earlier with the visas, that was also meant outside the EU, that these tourist visas are issued for three months, of course, are then also used by non-EU citizens to work and if someone from outside the EU now needs a visa where he wants to work, which is longer, it is then longer than the three months anyway. You have to be able to differentiate with the whole story. Then you could really change that.	0
I did the same thing and the response was immediate to stop the abusive behaviors. Like you most debt collectors just hang up. Those who stayed on immediately changed their tone of voice and behavior. I would advise anyone receiving verbally abusive, harassing, or threatening phone calls from debt collection calls buy a cheap telephone recording device and to use it when they call. When they inform you at the mini-Miranda point interrupt them and tell them that you too are now recording all debt collection calls. It's the most powerful tool any debtor can use.  	1
"If you want to instantly level the playing field, make any credit card debt above and beyond the moment of default, disputable. Disputability of any amount over the amount at the moment of default would instantly get both the credit card companies and the debt collectors working with the consumer on a reasonable plan going forward, no? As it stands now, credit card companies can and usually do jump the interest rate up to as high as 29.9% and may even let the account stay in default as they rack up frequent default points on the debtor. When I gave up my regional emmy award winning video business to become a caregiver for both of my parents, eventually savings ran out and I notified each of my credit card vendors ahead of any default. NONE could offer me anything other than, ""pay your bill on time"". If instead the credit card companies know that once the default occurs they cannot accrue any more penalties, fees or interest rate charges on the debt, they will bend over backwards to work with the alleged defaulter to get them to pay down the debt. Citibank rate jacked my never late payment 15 year old credit card account by 5,000 dollars. I dispute that amount of excess in lieu of why I had to default, but Citibank does not care, nor does the debt collector. The amount of the debt reverted to what it was at the time of the default, you can bet citibank would be working hard to work with me.  "	1
"I found an unsealed envelope in my mail box that had court documents in them. I contacted the debt collection company and asked what was going on since I had not been served. They claimed a subservice had already been done to someone at my residence. I explained that was probably not likely because I am a Caregiver and I would have been the only one to answer the door and I did not get any service. I had to pay to file a response and was late by one day, andthen had to challenge the default because of the non service. The judge agreed that there had been no valid subservice based on the fact that the service company used the most generic ""guess"" they could come up with, a women in her mid 30's to late 40's, around 5 foot 4 inches, weight around 130 pounds to 150 pounds. That is about as generic of a description as one could give, and it was completely wrong. because that person did not exist. They even made up a name of someone I had never heard of and when I googled the name, could not find it anywhere on the internet. The second time a false subservice happened, a very similar description was given as the first time, and the alleged subservice recipient was identified as ""Jane Doe"". I would like to point how dangerous these lies are on another level. I exclusively have been providing CareGiving services for my parents, no one else has. By lying and introducing these lies into a court document, anytime in the future I could be accused of exposing my parents to a person at our residence who never even existed. I was also somewhat frozen by this level of dishonesty because on the rare occasion when I had to sue someone, I followed the law and had the service performed legally and properly. I just expected the same in return and by not getting it weakens one's ability to respond.  "	1
The question is, in which time all this can be thought about, can be implemented, if there is a shortage of skilled workers. Normally, the positions have to be filled as quickly as possible, and this whole process - I think - will take far too long, if this is also determined at the EU level for the countries as a whole.	0
Get a copy of the police report and mail it to all three. They HAVE to put a freeze on your report, and you get a pin, and if you have to lift it you need to have that pin. It is quite a pain. I had a burglary in 2012 -- 14 pages of items stolen, I had to call all my credit cards and get issued new ones. Heartbreaking --not just things like my computer, but items of great value, and great sentimental value. The least you should have is the peace of mind of having a freeze on your report. And they HAVE to do it. Otherwise, go to a lawyer and let them dangle on the end of the meat hook. It is a pain, but worth doing.  	1
For [...] is that, for the [...] I don't know. The criteria - it seems to me that we need to define criteria, to define rules in this way, those that are discussed by our parliamentarians, by the government, and that these rules allow the person who will then have to decide whether this person can remain in the European Union or must leave the European Union, to do so only if the rules are sufficiently clear and well written. These rules, I don't know them today but I think our governments are busy.	0
I would like to see requirements that the consumers are required to provide written notice of any new addresses for the creditor to reach them so in the event the account does go into default, the creditor has current information to attempt to contact the consumer. Many consumers move frequently, yet fail to update the creditors  	0
"There is now a class of ""consumer representatives"" which obtains from debtors a signed ""Power of Attorney"" and who then claim to be authorized to act as the consumer's attorney for purposes of debt resolution. They routinely seek to avoid the debt, most commonly by not answering their phones. My current practice is to advise the relevant state bar of the unauthorized practice of law by these jokers; perhaps a clarification statement that such persons must be licensed to practice law in the state in which the debt is being collected would cut down on the confusion.

I used to work in Switzerland in my former life and when my employment contract expired, I had to leave Switzerland within 14 days - so why can't we do that?	1
i can agree with Franz. We have many different countries and all of them somehow care about autonomy. The goal is maybe now to find a common European approach. To get away from this autonomy. We should not only focus on the specifics of each one, let's look at the commonalities. Now I can also agree with Manfred on the following: crime. This is indeed a sociological problem and not a migration problem. Many things are raised here, but somehow we get lost. We fail to focus on one question and one answer.	0
I also think that this is a very important point. Immigrants must feel welcome in a country. This is a very delicate point because there are a lot of obstacles to immigration, such as health insurance, etc., bureaucracy, and also in relation to the native population, between [...] and this is another thing. I think it's a big problem to move illegal immigrants from one country to another as is common practice in Europe. And I think this is a big problem. And since people who are already completely uprooted and who usually don't leave their homeland of their own free will are once again deprived of their roots, this is a problem that goes far beyond what is reported in the media.	0
"I agree that expanding the scope of the validation notice would benefit consumers. Especially important is a means for the consumer to contact the original creditor and identify the account in question. When debts are sold multiple times it becomes impossible for consumers to: (1) determine if the account is theirs; (2) validate proper assignment; and (3) determine if the statute of limitations has expired. The current requirements facilitate ""zombie debt"" accounts which - although already paid by the consumer - come back to life again and again. Absent a means for consumers to identify an account there is no way for them to verify that they have previously paid that debt.  "	0
"Collection Agency's' should be REQUIRED by law to show their phone number when calling a debtor. Most if not all come up ""unknown"". If they are a legitimate company then they should have no problem showing their number. If I call them, and my number is blocked, I can't get thru until I unblock my number. If they truly are legitimate, they should want to do things fair and above board.  "	0
Gambling is an addiction. If a parent has an addiction to gambling, limiting their access isn't going to change the reality of their disease. It would be along the same logic of limiting the amount an alcoholic can drink; an alcoholic has a disease and 'limiting' won't change their desire to drink. Those with addiction will find a way to do these things, regardless of the amount of 'restrictions' you put in place.	0
I think that both an English and Spanish letter should be sent. This already happens with most legal and other important things (like voting and letters from school) in my State. But this should be a fed requirement to always include Spanish.  	0
I would like to take a big leap and change the perspective if you allow me. What we need are capable politicians, especially in Germany we need capable politicians on the subject of immigration, but we also need immigrants, but qualified immigrants! And even these qualified immigrants are no longer available for Germany, because these people do not feel safe in Germany anymore. At this point I think we should really ask ourselves the fundamental question: Is our country ready and able to receive the foreigners we need? Shouldn't we change our own behavior so that they want to come to us?	0
I support these restrictions on robo-calling and any calls during the work hours. With respect to robo-calls, any robo-calls that are misleading should be restricted. That is, a robo-call that tells you that you have a message or an account update, and the only way to get it is to call a special number with an extension, but when you call, it is just the same message asking where your payment is, is a waste of the consumer's time and the consumer's cellular resources (two phone calls, one received, one sent).  	0
"I believe that Batman always wins the ""who would win in a fight"" game if he can escape the first fight. CMV. Batman wins any fight in which he can escape the first battle, be it Marvel, DC, a dance-off with Freddie Mercury, whatever. I base this on a few things: -Bruce Wayne has the funds and resources of an entire corporation, so in a pinch he can spend his way to finding a weakness like Lex Luthor. (I mean, what other superhero can spend millions on kryptonite arrows _just in case Superman goes berserk_?) -He's a _freaking ninja_ with unparalleled training. If he gets into a fight or test of manual dexterity he can just study and learn the moveset of whatever needs done. (This is how he out-dances Freddie Mercury, obviously. -He's a master detective. As soon as he gets back to the batcave he'd be analyzing tape and info from the first fight. Spiderman's got webs? Okay. Make a web-dissolving serum. -The dude trains against a wide variety of villains all the time. The psychotic Joker, the cerebral Riddler, the raw power of Bane, the shifting form of Clayface... you name it, Batman's got experience scrapping against it. In short: Batman beats up everybody. Light-hearted willingness to CMV here. Wow me with your comic book prowess. **edit:** /u/ajfirecracker knocked this one out of the park, not to mention filling my mind with the horrific downfall of Batman to Cthulhu. Goddamn. Cthulhu would probably even let him go _on purpose_, just to watch Batman go insane trying to research an answer."	0
I said that I worked in a hospital, a French hospital, and to answer the question of illegals, in reality, what happens is that all the undocumented migrants in France have friends who have papers and it is very dangerous for them because you can see people who have the same blood group card for ten people. So ten women come to hang? with the same group card to have the right to care but on the other hand, they put their life in danger. That's the answer to the fact that they are illegal. That's why we can't tolerate keeping the illegals because they put their lives in danger too. We really need to legalize, perhaps on a case by case basis, as Rudolf just said, to do everything possible so that there are no more people who hire and exploit them; that they are really declared; that the whole family is declared so that they can have care and therefore to come back to what Serge-Henri was saying; because there are no more borders, it is obvious that this is not a problem that can be solved country by country but it is really a problem that must be solved by the European Union. So that we really take a common decision, indeed perhaps common criteria but I don't see how to do it for a country, then they put for example criteria and another country other criteria; it seems to me that it is no longer possible then current because there are no more borders.	1
I would just like to add to Hungary's answer: I don't know if there was an African country from which we didn't welcome people, because a lot of Africans came to our colleges and universities and the majority of these Africans went back home, there are a few who stayed, but they were trained, they are part of Europe - yes, before the European Union, we'll say it like that. So each university had a quota of people, had a department where in fact there were mostly foreign students, mostly Africans and some Asians. So they could come for free and some had to pay a fee. So it was a good compromise and it didn't cost Hungary that much. So it was a kind of help; today it's changed, it's over, we don't have African students anymore, we have Norwegians, we have Scandinavians, but all slowly the universities - well, it's a new orientation of education - we train lawyers, and lawyers and engineers, that's it but - I would say that in fact we train highly qualified unemployed people, that's it And our education strategy is wrong: what is happening today in the Union is not satisfactory because today someone who is twenty years old and has a manual job, what can he do? Nothing at all, there is no more production. Me in my time, I went to a technical school, at eighteen I was plunged into the deep end, I was given a team and there it was, work was everywhere, today it's not possible anymore.	0
I agree that of course an ideal situation would be for consumers not to pay. But let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I was proposing some viable method that would result in an ability of a consumer to have a hearing. Hearings cost money and ultimately the collector would be assessed.  	0
"During the past 2 years I have been repeatedly contacted by a variety of collection agencies. It began innocently enough, when one of them called me, asking ""when can we expect your payment,"" when that statement had not yet arrived and was not due until the 20th of the month and the call occurred on the 11th. It was a collection agency hired by Capital One. Coincidentally, I purchased various items at Costco a few days later and received the shock of my little life when my credit card was denied. I called Capital One from a phone at Costco and was told I had not made my payment... this was even stranger because I pay off my balance each month. What I didn't know is that Costco switched from a very nice bank (HSBC) to Capital One, never notified me and Capital One immediately played hardball, albeit unnecessarily. To answer their strong-arm tactics, I wrote a letter to Robert Crawford, the incoming CFO of Capital One, in which I had cut up both credit cards and told him to ""shove it,"" for treating a long-time customer like something you scrape off the shoe! When the collection calls began, I was in a great mood after all, I had initiated this mess. However, they were unfaird from the beginning. They use I.V.R. numbers. Without technical jargon, it means that the number we see on caller i.d. is never the number from which they're calling, so you can't block their call my provider allows me to block 12 numbers and I wondered how these collection agencies were constantly squeaking by). They robodial, so you can and do get several calls per day and before 8:00 AM and after 9:00 PM, since they know there is very little you can do about the early or late calls, besides whine That said, what followed was even worse.... the collection agency (Portfolio Recovery) which was able to place a bogus $9,924 ""collection"" on my Experian credit score, which I saw because Target offered me 1-year free credit monitoring, which, by the way, isn't free if you want to see your complete profile... they have no paperwork to substantiate this charge and it has completely ruined my credit, pulling down my FICO from 795 - 810 to 610! To me, having collection agency CEO's boiled in oil seems like an act of mercy!  "	1
But private arrangement between these entities doesn't change the fact that the money is still owed. Just because the original creditor took a loss on it, doesn't change what is really due. Is it ethical for someone to rack up tens of thousands of dollars of debt and never pay it back?  	0
Yes, I can only confirm that. So, I was a development worker in Africa for three years. And there, when you see the situation, when you can help them on the spot, well it's already much better, because in fact, I think that 0.9 percent of the social product. It should be put at the disposal of the cooperation aid. All the big countries of the Union are far from that. It is about 0.3 - 0.4 percent. Information - yes, where necessary - is a transfer of knowledge, yes, but please do not support the despots of these corrupt regimes.	1
"I believe a lot of people will never find ""love"", CMV Before all, I'm talking about ""common"" people, not the ones with major mental disorders, etc. Just people that you'll find on the street that seems ""normal"". Also just to clarify I'm talking in the strict sense of a partner, as an spouse or lover. Heterosexual by the way. And friendship it's excluded from this view. That's another topic. According to wolframalpha there are 2.177 billion ""adult"" males and 2.113 billion females. Of course demographics vary from country to country. But basically in every culture, there are people that can't find a partner due to psychological or physical problems. Or it may be that the peer group of ""x"" individual isn't large enough or doesn't have so much contact with the opposite sex. There are so many factors but in the end it may reduce to a problem with the subject or with his/her environment.. Also, like you read above, there's an unbalanced number. There are more females than males,, and a lot of people are turned off by competence. Those are external factors, but is in human nature to look only for the best ""genes"" to perpetuate it's existence, so a lot of *ugly* people seem to struggle more than a *pretty* person to find a partner. Monogamy and all of that is another matter. Also if we look for dating sites on the internet, it's just more complex, because in my experience there are 10 males for 1 female on dating sites (aprox). And so women become more picky, and so more males find it difficult to get a partner. So, despite humans being *social animals*, some of them are destined to be alone* for the rest of their existence. And this cycle will continue for the rest of time, or the duration of humanity. *Alone in the sense of not having a close relationship with another human being. Tl;DR; Some people are destined to be alone due to psychological, social or just chance factors, and thus will never find love, or a partner. Edit 1: [take a look at R4R]( for any given female, her post it's more likely to have 5 or more replies than a male one, which in average will have 1 or 2 replies, if he is lucky, of course that isn't a rule, because female more likely will send a private message than a public post, still it shows something.

I think it's problematic to say you can help any country. A large part of Iran or Iraq may not think that way. Yes, I think it's problematic that you want to help these peoples, because a large part of the population doesn't see it that way. We are talking about those who are fleeing, that is a minority, and if you were to tell the Iranians, for example, that you have to help them, then many would be offended. They would find that arrogant. And that's why it all sounds very idealistic, but you have to keep in mind the real political situation and see what you can do, but also take into account that these peoples have their own pride.	0
I totally agree with what the moderator just said about this. Indeed, as far as illegal immigrants are concerned, it is only at the European level that we can tackle this kind of problem. That we can actually do something about it. When each country takes its own measures. You will see that in one country it will increase, in another it will decrease, in their - we have seen what happened in Spain. There they declared a general amnesty for all illegal immigrants at once, they regularized them. And that still gave rise to a whole series of people who suddenly, who interfere? everywhere, but others also showed up in Spain to present themselves as illegal there. So at the level of illegality, I think that even more for the legal immigrants on want, it is important that there is a European approach. I plead for that. From the moment, when we want to develop a certain policy in this matter, as Europe we could provide a partial amnesty for illegal immigrants. But this is also a very arbitrary concept. For example, people who have been here for more than 5 years, for example. But that needs to be worked out further at the policy level, but I think it should be done at the European level.	1
You could still support an independent that shares most of your views. You will never find someone you agree with 100 percent of the time. Local ballot measures matter. Unlike voting for a person, you could be needing to vote for/against a law, school funding, local taxes (income and property). Local races also affect our daily lives just as much as the big races that get publicity. Crooked sheriffs, crazy judges, idiot zoning boards.. Even if you don't agree with the major party platform, you can vote for/against individuals based on their specific job performance. What's more important than just voting? Actually participating. Run for an office, no matter how small, attend local meetings, and question your council members about their decisions. Let them know someone is paying attention. Submit letters to the editor of your local newspaper about your opinions of the city meetings. Circulate petitions to get local matters on the ballots, so the issues can be subject to vote.	0
Yes we have to be careful. The economic crisis cannot be taken hostage. The problem of immigration has been there for decades. Long before the crisis and this crisis has been going on for barely a year. But it does have an impact on what we can do nowadays, but it shouldn't stop us from asking ourselves what we can do in the future.	0
"Simplicity ought to be the guiding principle and Alternative # 2 is closest to that principle, but expressions like ""charge-off"" should be avoided. That's a technical term specific to accountants. Some average consumers just aren't going to know what it means). Beginning with the amount owed on the date of default, then adding interest (including rate) is simple enough, still, the calculation of that interest could be included). Any and all fees ought to be listed, explained and JUSTIFIED. The same should hold true for any other charges, followed by payments and/or credits added after the date of default. This presentation would provide a clear picture.  "	0
As far as the problem of the illegal workers is concerned, they are in a network and they are exploited. I think there will not be a solution for everyone. We need to respect some of the regulations, but I have learned that the EU only selects educated people. I think that this is not a good situation, as we cannot only speak to few people; that they could come to the EU only with an appropriate education. We need to predict the regulations not only on the national level, but also on the European level.	0
Yes, I think that in immigration there is already the problem that everyone thinks what they want. But there is a problem of generation, which is very important. Because I'm sure that all these young people who have come, who are much younger than me, or certainly the lady next to me who is much older than me, have more or less the same synthesis on immigration. So my generation has not known immigration. [...] Immigration started a long time ago among the French-speaking people but I knew it anyway. We had the first immigration, I was in a small village, it was the Italians who arrived in the countryside. They integrated without problems. Afterwards we had a lot of Spanish and Portuguese who built houses. Like in Russia and France. They built their own houses. From their countries they came back. And those who came back are [...] so we finish for nothing [...]. We lived in Switzerland, we left. Then we had more... then we went on a little bit to the Maghreb country much more. So the first generation, I think I knew it. The first generation that arrived a little bit, they started to work, they were in small isolated neighborhoods, so they worked very hard. They integrated. But the second generation started not to integrate. And the third and fourth - I know that for years. That is, even an immigrant who is French - certainly, I consider him an immigrant. Because he doesn't speak French, because he speaks the Arabic language and lives like at home without caring how the neighbor lives. And I consider for me, they are immigrants. That is, they are as French as I am. That's the big problem. And that changes the visual aspect of the mass of immigration above all.	1
Creditors should only be allowed to call between the hours of 9am until 7pm local time unless they have written consent (maybe even a web form) that gives them a minimum 3 hour window in which to call. Additionally, they are limited to 3 phone calls a day maximum.  	0
I am an elected official. So I see things a little differently, if you like. But we had a problem... and it was not only in my city. We have Africans who came who are bigamists who have four wives. A hundred [?] children and how do you do it? It is forbidden in France, polygamy, I think it is forbidden in other countries in Europe. And how to do? Expel three of the women, keep one? how? and it's a problem that's going to happen everywhere. Because it's their culture and we have nothing to do with it.	1
It seems to me that Polish people are prejudiced, to a certain extent, against immigrants who do not belong to a European culture. I think the problem is that we have a stereotyped approach and that we are reluctant to think in a new way of other cultures. That seems to me a big problem in Poland. Off course I am generalizing it, but there is some lack of tolerance in Polish culture and this is quite a disadvantage. Thank you.	1
"As I have had many accounts in collection due to an identity theft, I have several different experiences with the ""validation"" process. My belief is that there is no rule defining exactly what documentation constitutes validation. As we know, if we dispute with the CRA and ask for a reinvestigation, all that will be done is the social security number will be matched and verified with the amount owed. It is a useless tool and a waste of the consumer's time. Asking for validation with a collection agency is almost as useless. This is because current laws suggest that the collection agency provide the consumer with information ""such as"" the name and address of the original creditor, and the amount owed. This does not prove a debt is still owed, and to whom it is owed. If we are going to allow companies to buy debts for amounts as low as pennies on the dollar, then the burden of proof MUST lie with the collection agency. As they are in the business of collecting debts, they are given all information regarding payment history, original contracts, methods of prior payment, and all personal information relating to the consumer. For far too long the consumer has been at the mercy of the collection agency. We are forced to send proof of our identity, current mailing address, phone number, etc. as well as all documentation we have regarding the account that would show an error has been made. The collection agency has this information readily available. And if they do not, the account should be permanently deleted. If the collection agency cannot produce documentation from the original creditor including (1)a contract (2)payment history from original creditor if any (3)proper identification of the consumer (4)proof of purchase of the debt (5)proof they are legally able to collect on the debt in the consumer's state-then there should be laws in place that prevent the debt from being reported. In most cases, it is being reported from the original creditor already. And if it isn't, this should be a red flag to CRA's that the debt is not valid. Collection agencies must be able to show proof that a collection notice was sent, and they should be required to provide the same proof a consumer must provide to prove a dispute was sent (CMRR). If it is required of the consumer, it should be required of all. A debt should be considered validated only when all of these conditions have been met. Without these safeguards, a consumer could end up paying a debt they do not owe. It happens all the time. How many stories have you heard of collection agencies voluntarily providing any information to a consumer before demanding money? They don't. Enough is enough. Take the burden of proof off the consumer and place it with the party that legally owns the debt.  "	1
So, if for example we were the ones making the decisions, we're all politicians so we're the ones who can make the decisions: What will we do? And that's kind of the point of this discussion and these three days because we are called to produce something that we would like politics to put into practice and because we tend to say: here politics is wrong, politics only makes mistakes but I have the solution, I know what to do and so that's what we have to do here, so try a way to find alternatives, solutions as if we were really politicians.	0
I have a very clear opinion. They should be treated in the same way. If there were more legal means of immigration, we would not have the problem of illegal immigration. It is only that when we say outside the European fortress, we accept that trained, highly qualified people, and the others remain outside. So we create the problem of illegal immigration. Otherwise, if there were regularized immigration procedures, we would not have the problem of illegal immigration.	0
If the consumer requests you do not call someone, do not call. This also leads into collector games, such as calling mother/father. brother, sister with sam elast name saying you thought it was their spouse and you were calling about an account...  	0
"Several courts have held""and the [FTC] and the [CFPB] agree'that a collector who sues or threatens suit on a time-barred debt violates the FDCPA. The FDCPA prohibits, among other things, the use of ""any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.""  These include making a false representation of 'the character, amount, or legal status of any debt,"" threatening 'to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken,"" and ""using any false or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt."" __URL__ It is in fact your gross distortion of the law and misunderstanding to claim that SOL are a defensive mechanism to allow a plaintiff ""to avoid being disadvantaged"" for not filing a lawful suit within a lawful time frame."	0
banks can simply add this provision to their Loan Sale Agreements. All buyers executing a Loan Sale Agreement containing such a provision would be contractually obligated to refrain from litigating or threatening litigation. some current buyer would refuse to purchase with such a provision and other current buyers would expect a price discount because they woudl not be able to sue. In both instances, any inventory not acquired by current buyers would be quicly snapped up by other purchasors who would be willing to comply with these contractual provisions. Such a resolution would obviate the necessity of legislation or regulation as the matter woudl have been taken care of under the contract between a willing seller and a willing buyer. there would be no constitutional question regarding the restricting of law suits nor would there be any delay in implementation. All that would be required is the cooperation of the selling banks which could be induced readily with some Safe-Harbor language for banks that follow this protocol.  	0
So I had read that in the brochure that the main illegal immigrants that we have, that the - they are illegal because their visas have expired and they were legal before. And that's actually the point in here; how to, with what possibilities, how to legalize them. That's what it was about. But I'm still looking it out.	0
If a collector is calling from a different number than the one they are displaying on Called ID, that should be not allowed. Does not allow the consumer to block those calls since the number displayed is not the one actually calling.  	0
I concur with previous comment. If consumers are informed when our mortgages are sold that should be a rule across the board. Sending a letter by mail isn't very expensive, either. It should contain the amount, info on original debt, the name and address of who owns the debt and I'd even add the amount the debt was sold for. Consumers can keep track for one thing, and make sure these debts are not posted twice on our credit reports, it will let people know who to contact about the debt.  	0
So the last topics - if I remember correctly - the last thing that was discussed was crime. The criminality, which he now specifically mentioned, which is socially justified; if someone has nothing to eat and is forced to obtain it illegally, I think that exists in every country and that has nothing to do with the pure topic of immigration - these are just the social circumstances that exist in each case. And on the other subject, where I said that crime is on the rise: The proportion now in Germany in particular - the proportionality of crime to German offenders and to foreign offenders - is balanced. The fact that there are certain types of crime that have an increased proportion of immigrants, that is specifically related to the respective crime, I dare to say that now simply because I have to do with it professionally, so I think that I can also make a statement about it, but I think that now has nothing to do with the topic itself, where we are currently dealing with - with immigration - now slowly. If I have understood correctly, should the EU now have an influence on this or do we prefer to leave it up to the states?	1
"While Demand Letters can be ineffective for the purpose of collecting a debt, ""notice is the hallmark of fairness."" It's more important that people are held to standards, which, in turn, help to eliminate abusive practices. Procedural safeguards, like demand letters, are an important standard regardless of their effectiveness.  "	0
So I actually, in terms of education, I think it would be a very good idea, I would have said actually, it's a very good idea to help people educate themselves in their own countries. But in these documents, I have seen that when we help people to be educated in their country, it is in fact an incentive to go and work elsewhere. Because if we train a nurse in Africa, she could come and work in France for a better salary and that is a temptation to go abroad. So, while it may not be a panacea, it is not going to solve everything either, which makes it very complicated, and this brings me to what I wanted to say before we stop, which is that in these documents, I found that there were some very interesting things that were suggested. And I would have really liked to have figures on the age of the people who migrate, on their education, in fact, what makes their life, because in fact, when we talk about immigration and what we could do, we very quickly come to say who we will accept and who we will not accept. And if we accept people who are qualified, it means that they won't stay in their country to help it to get by and if we accept people who are not qualified, it also poses other problems. When we put in place a policy of acceptance quotas, what does that do in relation to immigration in a country, because the countries that have immigration quotas - the United States or Australia - are countries where you can enter legally by meeting certain criteria. What do these criteria mean for illegal immigration? Does it reinforce immigration or does it calm it down? If people have a hope of entering legally, will they stop taking risks to enter illegally? That's a lot of questions.	1
I think they should have to have a license to be debt collectors and at the time they did not. Additionally there should be harassment laws regarding just this matter about landlords as if someone sues you 3Xs for the same thing, they should lose their collections license. I even responded from the very beginning with a certified letter stating that I did not owe any part of the debt! Additionally what did help after almost 20 years was reporting the landlords real estate license for violating business practices in NYS for overcharging rent statements. This certainly got their attention however I still had to retain an attorney for a lawsuit against them and prevailed but then you have to pay the 20% of what you recoup to the attorney. I wish they would just lose their license for harassing you for 20 years. It is disgusting that no one in NYC has done anything about it but then I don't need to tell you how corrupt everyone there is and that includes the legal system. NYC government and housing system is like dealing with the mob and I say that after having to deal with them aggressively for the past 3 years after being attacked for almost 20  	1
When an attorney is a 'Debt Collector' (as per their own documents) and not legally considered a 'Collection Agency' the attorney is not held accountable for consumer protection law violations (both local and federal) within civil court. This loop hole needs to be addressed. The attorneys/debt collectors are not monitored by the state bar because it is a collection practice (the attorneys buy old debt and then collect upon that debt in civil court and the state and federal civil courts are not monitoring the attorneys because it is an attorneys office and not considered a collection agency - even though the attorneys buy old debt then take alleged debtors to civil court. I personally know of a very large attorney agency in Washington State that even gives classes thru the Washington state bar to other attorneys because it is a easy caseload to win.  	1
If our client(s) can't provide any verification of the debt, we close the account and send the debtor a letter that we are doing so. Note: this has only happened once or twice in 20 years. an unresolved dispute account should NOT be sold. If so, seller should be liable.  	1
Excuse me, but I am not sure if you understood well my statement. I did not mean that this is profitable in an economic way. I meant that not only cheap labour force is coming to our country, that we can not generalize it, and throw all the people to the same box. Only this and just this I wanted to say. Nothing more. I know that Ukrainian are coming to Poland and working for much lower salaries than Polish, and I also think that this is not fair.	0
"I appreciate Mr. Bartmann's comments but they appear to be grounded in a collection agency perspective (there is always business and market share tension between collection agencies and law firms). The reality is that (and this was voiced by other participants) many (not all but many) debtors simply won't/can't pay until they have to. The FDCPA and TCPA have truly made communications with debtor both difficult and hazardous for the collector. For instance, the fact that you can't safely leave a voice message for a debtor should be very troubling. Over the years, our firm has stopped initial outbound calling (responding only to inbound calls) and also limited our pre-suit letters to just two. We send the required disclosure letter and (there being no response and the account reviewed for suit) then send a discounted payment offer that says we are going to file suit but would rather settle. We offer reasonable terms to the debtors to avoid a costly suit but the response rate is absolutely miserable, probably in the single digits percentage wise. Believe me, suits are time consuming and expensive, but they are often simply the only option. Even when the debtors are served, few contact us, and even fewer when the court sends them the judgment. Worse, a judgment doesn't guarantee payment on the account. Clarification via Regulations as to what we can say and do in communications would at least promote more communication between the parties. With that, perhaps more points of contact could resolve debts before suit. I strongly disagree that litigation should be ""discouraged"" as it is not only a simple reality in much of debt collection but a fundamental right of a creditor. However, I think Regulations making it clear what can and cannot be done in communications that can shield the industry from the wild west of FDCPA and TCPA lawsuits would greatly encourage more communication. I also think a reasonable, good faith attempt to resolve the case (offering a payment plan and/or lump sum) before suit is filed is still a good idea as well even though our own response rate has not been great. Anything more will infringe on a creditor's rights and interfere with state law. Perhaps the CFPB Portal could have a debt resolution aspect to it where a debtor could try to resolve an account in a ""safer"" more disarming manner.  "	1
Yes there are legal migrants and there are refugees. That's a different thing. Those are asylum seekers and I don't think that's comparable. That's not immigration that's asylum seekers...	0
As far as I'm informed, just in Iraq, the oil, the, more or less the Americans are [earning] themselves silly on the Iraqi oil. And again to the poor countries, where there are the refugees from, there I just saw a few days ago on TV, there is from the West, so from Japan I mean - I do not have the individual countries in mind - but Japan buys in Bangladesh there the most beautiful piece of land for golf courses, where water is wasted and lawn and the food basis is partly taken away. That is in Africa, that is in Bangladesh, in India, so the poorest are taken away land where they have grown vegetables for stupid golf courses. Nothing against golf, but I think that's really unbelievable in part.	1
I would like to ask a question because finally, when we talk about someone who opens a store or someone who has a business, it's an entrepreneur who arrives and does something that no one else has done in his place, but it's someone who has his life, who is independent, who pays contributions, he contributes to his retirement, he settles in a country in fact, maybe who will retire or maybe not, but it's not at the limit, it's not the point. He makes his life, he comes there, he makes his life. I would say that for me the problem of immigration is more a problem of clandestine immigration with people who take great risks to arrive in Europe, to have a chance to do something and for me, it is really this immigration that poses problems, because it puts them in danger, because they are people who are often exploited, they work for entrepreneurs who don't pay them, who make them take risks, so again they are people who have a very hard life and then there are all the facts that they don't contribute for their retirement, so it's somehow money that the government misses too. So for me the immigration problem -	0
too much immigration at the moment. At least too mixed. Only those who are needed in terms of work should really come. So it's not just that you say they're war refugees or some of them I've spoken to personally, they're just avoiding compulsory military service in their country, yes my, that's not a reason to emigrate from the country. So, I would say my opinion. There are still other possibilities than then to slip away into a country, only for example to take part in this compulsory military service. And special I find also the work problem. Those who have the university degree, or someone else must have a university degree. But those who have a specification can come, in my opinion, but it shouldn't be the case that they just come here and, well, now I'm putting it a bit bluntly, just live off social welfare. That is now my first opinion.	0
"I was harassed for months by a collector who used robo-calls 5 and 6 times a day and blocked its caller ID, for what turned out to be five different debts, none of which were mine. Robo-calls were not answered; if I picked up, nobody was there, and no messages were ever left. The blocked caller ID was ""1 Unavailable,"" which is designed to outfox call-blocking from the recipient's end, and makes it impossible to identify the caller using reverse number lookups and the like. One day I picked up and finally there was someone on the other end, so I was able to figure out who was calling, although they were very reluctant to say who they were. I then looked them up on the internet and got a phone number for them. I repeatedly stated I was not the person they were looking for, but they refused to stop calling. I finally got an attorney and after months of the attorney bickering with them, I did get a small money settlement. This was occurring when I was getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer and was very ill. My life was hell for months because of these practices. Collectors should be prohibited from concealing either their identity or their call-back numbers. This happened because I had moved and was assigned a new number that evidently had belonged to a number of individuals who had outstanding debts. I was afraid to change my number again because it would just usher in a new batch of collectors. There should also be much, much, much stiffer monetary penalties for violations. The guilty party in the above scenario was a national collection agency with huge annual revenues; the piddly amount I was eventually paid was to them a tiny fraction of one cent compared to their annual revenues. I just happen to be an attorney myself, and ran their name on Pacer-- they had been sued over and over in state and federal court and had actually paid million dollar fines to state attorneys general--also just a small cost of doing business for them compared to their enormous annual revenues. We need much, much stiffer penalties. These people are cyber bullies with absolutely no scruples. At the very least they should be required to identify themselves on caller i.d. with a legitimate callback number, and robo-calls should be made illegal.  "	1

"News is TERRIBLE for the general public, for the reasons you cited, and also because of herd mentality. You only need to look at reddit sometimes to see how people tend to flock to some news, disregard others, and then validate their views based on each other's pats on the back. However, you said ""News is bad for you"", with the ""you"" being interchangeable with anyone. the problem is that News are GREAT for some people : analytic-minded people, scientists... and historians. Let's pretend for 5 seconds that news don't exist. We the people live in blissful ignorance, and our leaders still get informed of everything through their secret service and intelligence bureaus. For the sake of this discussion, let's imagine that no leaks have ever happened. Every major scientific discovery has gone unnoticed by 99% of the population. With no media outlet to turn to, scientists have to resort to peddling to show off their wares. When they get noticed by someone powerful, their invention gets stolen - it's much easier to apss it off as your own than it is to pay royalties. And without big news agencies to bring the public eye to that sort of thing, who's going to argue ? Let's imagine that everything up to WWII went along like it did in the real world. Nobody knows about the concentraiton camps. Jewish people get killed off on a larger scale, the culprits don't really get hunted down, and no-one really cares : we're all blissfully ignorant. Let's pop forward thousands of years : no textbook ever mentions WWII, or if they do, they give a propagandist view of it, and America is glorified. why ? because with the media outlet, no-one has any experience t share to the world, no-one has a story that sticks, and veterans die with their memories. also, why would the american government publish a true account of the thing when they could make it seem like they were heroes ? any government would do the same. Another situation : missing kid. No media outlets : no amber alert, etc. So all in all, I think news are useful. (not feeling particularly motivated for a great closing sentence)"	0
I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV In specific I attend a university where all students pay athletic fees in exchange for the use of school gym facilities. While I already think that this should be changed to an opt in/out system I am more interested in hearing reasons why women's only hours are defensible. This renders particular pieces of equiptment totally unavailable to male students (as they are only present in specific gyms) for hours during prime times throughout he day. So if one is paying equal fees to all other students why is one not allowed equal access and how is this a good thing? Doesn't it simply perpetuate sexism? EDIT: I appologize for the sentence where I use the term I. I am female and have taken advantage of these hours in the past I merely meant it to be sort of illustrative but it ended up being very unclear. EDIT2: Hey all this post generated a ton of great discussion and showed me a lot of ways that my view lacked nuance. My view has definitely undergone some substantial change and I'll work on awarding delta's to those arguments. Thanks all!	1
I should know if a debt is time-barred, so that I can make an informed decision regarding the debt in question. The information should be in the validation notice. If the debt becomes time-barred after the validation notice is sent, I should be informed of the new status of the debt IMMEDIATELY!  	0

"Your main fallacy is the current perspective. You are listening to The Beatles after hearing thousands upon thousands of songs and bands that were influenced by their work (both directly and trickle-down). At the time in America chart-topping music was slow, boring, religious, safe, and fairly sterile ([check it)]( The Beatles were different and that's exactly what the youth of America was looking for. Did more talented artists exist... yep. Are The Beatles the most original band ever... nope. Does a lot of it amount to ""the right place at the right time""... yep. Are teenagers fickle and cling to popularity... super-yep. BUT... They kicked the door open for other (even better) bands to even exist. Nothing is original. We are telling the same basic stories in today's blockbuster films that we told each other in smoldering caves. Popular does not equal good. Good does not equal popular, but there is no denying the influence The Beatles have had over the past six decades. Greatness is defined by your mark on history, not necessarily your actual ability."	0

They always say that these people are paid less. But to that, I would like to react. Because for maybe 90 percent it's maybe a bit of a fable. It must certainly happen that people are underpaid. But not so much that people sleep in a caravan or under the ground where they work. That's often their own choice. We earn a lot of money, that is a logical consequence. And these people, if they are offered a place to sleep, finally go to pay 500 Euro for a small rent somewhere, not terrible or three Euro to be in a caravan, but as much as illegal, I soon make my account. In the case of my work, I've been around the world, finally. And I too have tried to offer my services. And I know how these people feel too. When for three or four months you have to [stay in a hotel?] you are all alone. And it's really not pleasant. It puts you in a bad mood. Do we finally make these thoughts etc. so either finally in the choice, well, we say to ourselves: here, I'm going to deposit my money, but I'm bringing [...]. I have a family at home, so I can keep the money and not spend it, and take it home. So the way people criticize this kind of thing, [...] but I can say that it's not easy to judge this kind of situation.	1
I think probably the benefits of giving debt collectors and buyers access to these documents would NOT worth the costs unless the documents have to be included with the validation notice. If the debt collectors were anxious to be sure they had the right debtor, sure, great. But I don't think they are. The actual guy on the phone is only anxious to get the money; he doesn't really care where it comes from or whether the debt is legal. Giving him the information, without giving it to the debtor, probably wouldn't be much good. And maybe I'm being unfair. Maybe these companies are strict about making sure the debt is collected from the right person. Naaah....  	0
I had the following question, maybe I will explain it once more. In the past I have read it in the press, in the newspapers, and it concerned trade, for example meat, and then some problems with import of Polish meat to Russia occurred. Now Poland is a EU member, so I guess the country wants to have economic relations with other countries, maybe more with those of Western Europe than with Russia. I would like to know whether there had been some big changes as it comes to economic links. Is it as it was before, with the East, or more with the West? How did the fact that Poland joined the EU influence the economy? Were there any differences before or not? Here the answer is ‘no’, but I have imagined that when one is a member of the EU, there are more economic relations with other countries of the EU than those from the outside. So there would be some changes and I think that it has an effect on the public economy. [07: 35]	1
If the immigrants will work legally then taxes should be discharged. This will facilitate greatly the people to stay. If the employer hires black immigrants, we have to hail them and give a big penalty to them[employers] because the state loses, and so do ordinary citizens for whom we have to keep those immigrants later.	0
I agree with Thomas. I've looked at the document and I've also looked at the pros and cons. Given the current situation, it's impossible to put this into application verbatim. We already have to tailor it again to reality, find some kind of middle ground, compromise. And also guarantee that immigrants respect the culture of the host country. When you come to Europe, it is logical that you accept European customs. That's when you can talk about integration. It is necessary to respect rules. If you are a Muslim, there are traditions or cultural aspects that are not permitted in Europe. You have to respect that. Ana talked about immigration being regulated by employers. Again, that has advantages and disadvantages. Well, an employer might be looking to hire someone at cheaper wages. In the hotel and restaurant business, they don't really care about quality, they just want to have to pay less for the waiter.	0

the selection, so indeed, as far as I am concerned, it is perhaps a threat. I don't think we should give in to that in Europe. We already said earlier that it's afternoon, at this point, we will perhaps choose those who, in the developing country, could contribute to the wealth there. And we will look for them there. We won't take those who are, who have malaria. That's not what we're going to do. We're going to choose the best ones, economically speaking. And so, we must not accept this. I think that we should first have respect for the people who had the courage to come to Europe. First of all. We sometimes underestimate. In a lifetime, you come from a completely different culture, a completely different continent. They come for the money, they say. And of course. And there's nothing wrong with wanting to earn more money. We all would like to. But if you have to select them by criteria, it becomes an economic selection, and you have to refuse that.	0
Personally, I think that Poles have made a big progress. That they tolerate other religions, races and I think, that people who come to our country often do not want to get to know us or accept our culture, religion – which I think are deeply rooted. So I think there is a huge progress with acceptance in Poland. Thank you.	1
My daughter has both private and federal loans through Sallie Mae. They call her cell phone and my cell phone daily, at least 10 times a day. They called me, by the way, they do not have her permission to speak with me, and tell me to stop paying her federal loans because they can be deferred and pay the private loans. My daughter owes 176000.00 in private loans and can't afford to make the payments that they are asking for. They called her employer requesting information on her. She sent a letter and requested that they only contact her through email and US mail. When they called me I asked them if they received this and they said yes but they need to be able to talk to someone. Well, they don't have my number as a contact number. I told them and they still call my cell phone daily. My daughter can barely pay the bills she has now. I help her pay her private loans. I am not on any of her loans. This harassment needs to stop!  	1

"Debt collectors should announce themselves and refrain from acting like: investigators, attorneys, or hitmen. There needs to be an enforced code of behavior that represents a professional on the other end of the phone. Most recently, my husband has been receiving threatning phone calls from a collector pretending to be a law enforcement investigator. The most humiliating part is that the calls have escalated to his ex-wife, cousin, and associates. He has a common name and the ""investigator"" has not properly identified himself or clearly identified if my husband is the right person that the debt belongs too. In addition, the so called debt is 8 yrs old, and they call from unknown numbers or if the number shows up and it's googled there are comments stating that the persons calling are harassing.  "	1
You are absolutely right. But, you'd be surprised at how many times this does happen and how many times the Credit Bureaus Do change correct information to false information supplied by the 'furnisher/debt collector'. Because I had to send in numerous Certified Letter to the Credit Bureaus, (all of them), in order to stay on top of all the false information and tricks that they did supply.

Yes, I just wanted to say that in France, the problem of immigration, the refusal of immigrants, is often linked to a political coloration, which is practically the extreme right. This is a bit of a context, and obviously, it bothers a lot those who think that the extreme right leads to things that are completely harmful, that are generally anti-European and anti-immigration. Well, that's to close the parenthesis. I would simply like to say that of course, I am completely - I think that it is impossible to avoid legal immigration in Europe. So, a certain amount of legal immigration, I say legal, that is to say that it is planned, calculated, but simply, my personal concern is that this legal immigration, in my opinion, must be compensated by means that must be given to the country of departure of these immigrants, because it will always continue if we steal their brains from the poor country. So soon, my colleague [GE] just now talked about the Togolese doctors who were extremely numerous in the Paris region, right? And soon, in Togo, there were French doctors. It is beginning to letter? and since there are many many French doctors who are going to practice in Togo in the framework of humanitarian missions, with humanitarian associations. So, we have here something that is not going very well. Shouldn't we, I don't know, in the bilateral agreements, see if we can't facilitate the return of Togolese doctors to Togo, so that they participate in the greatness and development of their country rather than [keeping] Togolese brains in France? So I know, of course, when you take immigrants in a poor country, it makes an economy for the country that receives it. That's for sure, when we receive someone who has an education and when we have not paid for his training, it makes an economy to (...) for the country that receives him. So all this, I think that immigration must be calculated and we must know what we take from the poor country to start it. I believe that we need legal immigration but within the framework, of agreement, either of Europe with the countries of the third world, or of bilateral agreements from country to country.	1
"Can there be a national repository to report abusive phone calls from debt collectors that masked (fake and ""spoof"") their caller ID? I got a brand new phone number a few years ago and it obviously previously belonged to someone who is delinquent on their bills because I get calls everyday from debt collectors looking for the person who had my phone number before me. No matter how many times I tell them they have the wrong number, they don't care and they just keep calling and they call from spoofed phone numbers. And this is my cell phone, which is against the law for debt collectors to call. The same debt collectors call with faked caller IDs. Here are just some of the phone numbers these debt collectors use: 808-792-8186 462643 858-568-7632 805-322-4584 706-913-1192 808-348-0083 858-345-4076 858-312-7724 908-505-9008 800-633-2677 252-808-7969 571-522-0386 407-712-3093 213-816-2972 804-721-3193 678-781-4530 427307 858-240-4079  "	1
As it comes to selective immigration, I think that the decision cannot be made by some kind of businesses’ organization. Some government could decide on it in a democratic way and this authority could make a decision about the selective immigration and the criteria of selection.	0
But yes, I did look at the options, the pros and cons. And following the discussion, I also came to the conclusion that in other countries, or migration, these are two different things. I think that migration is not the way to solve world poverty. It is not the right way. I think that we have to do it within the people on the spot. Migration can only be seen as helping Europe to solve its population problem, I don't think that's the right word, yes, this demographic problem. Migration is also necessary, where there is a shortage of manpower to solve this problem. But, finally, I think that we should choose the option that it should be allowed only if there is a real demand from employers. That's what I conclude. Finally, we have just had within the EU an authorized migration for people who have a certain qualification. If you can be a referent. Frankly, you can be sent to the Netherlands or England, etc., and work there. And then you work. That's the option that employers have, and that's what I like best. [1 :	0

""No one - especially in France - will accept this and it has no influence on the largest group of illegal migrants, the people who stay after their visas expire, because I think this is the main group of people who come to our country and we must try to find another solution. So I propose that we go directly to the next point, if you agree."	0
This could work only if you could keep the reset a secret. If it *isn't* a secret you've massively, catastrophically, distorted economic incentives. Lets list a few examples: 1. At some point, a few years or less before the reset all the most productive members of society *stop working*. Why? Because they've saved enough to live off of the next few years and there is zero reason for them to work for money they'll just have to give up. 2. At the same time the demands for a certain class of goods go through the roof: any thing that is consumed in the short term but has long term dividends. *Everyone* wants to go to school, get training, or go on vacation. *No one* wants to teach classes, do training or serve people on vacation. This is basically a mega great-depression. 3. Have an idea for a new technology that could change the world? Is it something you could reasonably expect to profit from for more than the next decade and that no one is likely to beat you to? Then keep it a secret until just after the reset. No major technological innovations for the years leading up to the reset will nicely contribute to the biggest recession the world has even seen. 4. Farmer? In normal times you've been rotating crops to keep from over farming. Logger? Are you planting new trees to replace what you're growing down? Have you been keeping that stream clear for your grandchildren to enjoy? Screw it: the land is about to be someone else's: time to make a quick buck by using it as a chemical waste dump. 5. Want a loan or capital of any kind to start a business? I can't imagine why since you'll lose everything you make. But even if you did: you won't be able to get it. No one is going to loan you money they won't get back. No one is going to stay invested in your company when they can spend the dough on caviar and hookers. Now, add one more thing: this proposal is *less* politically feasible than making all hiring and admissions blind. I don't think getting rid of inheritance is a good idea (similar screwing with incentives): but it is certainly easier than your plan. And doing things like that doesn't create these perverse incentives.	0
Can I ask you a question? Why does your country need seasonal workers? They are coming because Polish people do not want to take these jobs? Why has the number of the seasonal workers increased in Poland? What kind of jobs are they taking?	0
"You unduly separate ""women's decisions"" and ""discrimination"". A woman's career choices can be affected by the judgments she expects from people. Even a simple ""I want to help people"" thought can automatically and unconsciously lead to teaching or nursing for a woman and being a doctor for a man. This is because of the lack of stereotype-breaking role models in children's lives. Additionally you fail to ask why all those traditionally female roles are less well-paid. Teachers' pay is set centrally so it's not just the market (although if something is caused by the market that doesn't mean it's not caused by the patriarchy too). Why do we value things women want to do less than we value things men want to do?"	0
"I believe *more* socialism is needed for the U.S. to prosper CMV In spite of the cries from some media sources that Obama is a socialist and that socialism is bad, I firmly believe the opposite is true. Obama is *definitely* not a socialist and that a little more socialism in the U.S. will help our country prosper. In addition to the socialized institutions we have now: police, fire department, public schools, postal service, etc. we should also have socialized health care, higher education, and utility services that everyone depends on like electricity, natural gas, and water. I have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now. New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus, but I think broadening the income eligibility would be a great solution, even if buyers had to pay the full premium. I had to pay the full premium as part of a child support order ($78/week) and would gladly pay that for myself or other members of my family. Some communities already have co-ops (publicly owned utilities) that are much more reasonable in price than private or corporate-owned utilities. I have yet to find someone in the service area of a co-op complain about their service. The city I live in sold their publicly-owned (municipal) water company to a private entity. No change in service, yet the cost of water and sewer service has literally tripled since the change. I think these are essential to public well-being and should not be monopolized by a for-profit corporation. The only compelling argument against this I have heard so far is that private corporations will spend more money on R&amp;D and innovative technologies. I think advancements and new technology will still happen in the universities, grant-funded research, and so on. Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom. [**Edit**: I understand that this isn't *exactly* socialism... but it's a lot closer than what we have now.] [**Edit 2 - Clarification**: My idea of ""publicly-owned"" is more along the lines of a [Utility Cooperative]( where ""Each customer is a member and owner of the business with an equal say as every other member of the cooperative, unlike investor-owned utilities where the amount of say is governed by the number of shares held"". I am *not* necessarily advocating utilities be ""government-run""]"	1

The problem is not with a form letter of dispute. The problem is that these websites and unreasonable letters lead unsophisticated debtors to believe that a creditor has to provide extraordinary proof that simply is not required. 'stopwithspoofedcallerID' (if that IS your real name) is correct that no legitimate dispute should be ignored, regardless of the form, but nor should debtors be allowed to abuse the system by repeatedly asking for proofs that are not required.  	0
I totally agree with you, because in the area or the space where I live - so I agree with my colleague, because this problem doesn't exist at all in the space or in the area where I live. But there are indeed other areas that are not interesting for immigration in Poland.	1
If federal rules can be ignored by local/municipal/state laws then the federal laws are irrelevant. Consumer credit is recognized in all 50 states and internationally. As such these laws should be enforced by each state and lower courts and states and such should not be able to make laws that ignore of superseed federal law.  	0
Some countries have much more illegal immigration due to their geographic location, like Spain for example, and other countries send their immigrants on to other countries where the economic situation is better, much more attractive for people.	0
No absolutely, to me it's a problem for them that they don't have a pension, it's not a problem for me. They create wealth, but there is a whole - end, if the job that is held by an illegal immigrant was held by someone official, he would pay health insurance, he would pay retirement, there would be rights afterwards, but he would contribute while he is there. I don't know if this is a problem in Hungary as well - I think that in France, people who are settled are perhaps less of a problem. There are, of course, problems related to the acceptance of people's differences, there are always people who will find it difficult to accept people who are different, but I think that this is perhaps less of a problem. I don't know if in Hungary you have illegal immigration also which is strong.	0
I say I totally agree but you have to ask them some things too. So they also have to be ready to integrate and so if it's five or ten from the same country that start to create a little ghetto again and they don't want to have anything to do with the others and so on, who only have contact with each other...	0
I might have a possible solution. But first of all, I will summarize the discussion I have just heard. But or with my own opinion. It seems to me that the problem to be solved is the mentality of the people who come from outside. And when you can't influence them to adapt to the conditions that they find in the host country, because what applies from the moment you immigrate to another country, it is implicit that you will submit to the laws of the host country. The problem of mentality is not something concrete. There is no one in the world who will tell you: if you have such a religion, you will adopt another religion, if you want to stay with us. Nobody will be able to do that and in fact it will be against the human right and each of us has the right to practice his own religion. We can't force anyone to adapt the religion of the host country.	0
I would like to react. In fact it is true that those who have a passport in Germany and who want to integrate must also have a certificate, must prove that they know the German language and German history itself, so before having a residence permit, one must see this certificate or this certificate.	0
Yes Petra, I agree with you: in law, the EU is very much in it. I'm a technician, I'm working on new different technical committees; just what is determined in the regulations - rules of technology - by the EU today, that's unlikely. We come yes with the environmental problem again certainly on the light bulb regulation; from my point of view the biggest bullshit there is, but there we can still talk about it.	1
"I'd argue that the problem with this is that while it makes a certain sort of sense, history shows that it would be applied for bad purposes and that the solution proposed causes more problems than it solves. This isn't speculation, but rather the only conclusion that can be drawn from the USA's prior history of judicially mandated sterilization. One of the stated purposes [1] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children. In practice what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage (even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect), and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed. I don't at all like the idea of people with a past history of neglect and abuse having kids. And I'm not speaking abstrctly here, I've got relatives who are abusive and neglectful towards their children (CPS has taken them away, and quite rightly so) and they keep having more children (which CPS can't take away until they manage to gather evidence of abuse and/or neglect, so the newborn has a month or three living with horrible people before CPS can do it's job and get the kids out). If there were ever candidates for forcible sterilization, I know two personally and agree 100% that in a perfect world they would not be allowed to reproduce. But, unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world. We live in a nation where the courts and police can be statistically shown to police minority groups more heavily than majority groups [2], we live in a world where the courts give longer sentences to minority groups than to majority groups [3]. Moreover, the courts have a statistically demonstrable tendency to simply not charge rich people, and on the rare occasion rich people do get into legal trouble they get lighter sentences than poor people (if for no other reason than that rich people can afford really great lawyers, while poor people get overworked public defenders). Further, we have historic evidence that the last time it was tried, mandatory sterilization was directed mainly against the poor and black. Given all that, I would argue that the social problems caused by legally mandating sterilization are going to outweigh the benefits of having fewer children abused or neglected. I don't like that. I honestly wish I could support mandatory sterilization because I've seen firsthand what happens when people unfit for parenthood keep having kids. I will say that I think the better solution is reality based, age appropriate, sex ed in schools, starting at kindergarten and continuing through graduation. And easily available free contraception. Because the truth is that most of the people who are having kids they abuse and neglect don't really want kids in the first place. This also isn't speculation, in nations where sex ed is better, and contraception is more affordable or paid for by the government, the rate of child abuse and neglect is lower than in the USA. [1] I say ""one"" because another of the big stated purposes of the America's foray into court ordered sterilization was eugenics. [2] Example: the majority of people arrested for possession of marijuana are black, despite the fact that every study done to date has shown that black people use marijuana at a significantly lower rate than white people. All things being equal, you'd expect the majority of arrests for possession of marijuana to be white (not only are whites the majority, but they use pot more frequently). Yet black people get arrested for it more than white people. [3] Black people get sentences about 60% longer, on average, than white people who committed the same crime."	1
"I wanted to say that I only know German law. The law of these days in Germany does not allow the situation of illegality. And to say ""I am undocumented, I am illegal, I have violated the law of these days in Germany, but I still want to stay here. ""I don't think that works. I think these people will simply be deported. So, a change of the law in Germany, the law on the right of these days, should be done instead. At least as far as Germany is concerned."	1
We are talking about illegal immigration, but I saw in the booklet that in terms of legislation on legal immigration, three countries had reserved the right not to sign the various European agreements. So, at that moment, (...) the questioning, it remains the same in fact in relation to the discussion we have. Why? Why would we allow countries not to be signatories in common on legal immigration and [similarly] in relation to illegal immigration in fact.	1
This is pretty much the way I thought for a long time until I got my fiancée an engagement ring. After doing lots of research I am extremely happy with my purchase of a diamond engagement ring. There are several reasons why to buy a diamond 1) The cartel has broken. You expressed some concern saying “I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren't rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market.” While that still is true to a certain extent the big cartel player (De Beers) has finally been broken. In 2000 producers in Russia, Canada and Australia decided to cut off channels to De Beers due to the negative publicity of “blood diamonds” and De Beers has been losing market share. De Beers’ market share fell from as high as 90% in the 1980s to less than 40% in 2012. In 2011 the Oppenheimer family announced their intention to sell the entirety of their 40% share. Price manipulation is now far more difficult. You could argue at this point in 2013, there is no manipulation and it is simply the market. 2) You’re not buying the rough diamond, you’re buying the art. Diamonds are expensive. I mean wtf they are just shiny hard pieces of carbon, I mean hell so is my ass. So why are they so expensive? It’s because of the art and skill it takes to cut a polish a rough diamond. These are skilled professionals who take years of training and experience to cut a rough diamond and actually make it look fantastic. Cut, the most important quality in my opinion, is almost entirely dependent on the skill of the diamond cutter. And even the carat is dependent on the diamond cutter not cutting too much. What this means of course is no diamond is the same. That may sound lame but it’s true. Small differences in facet pattern can produce large differences in the pattern of light that is reflected off the stone. Every diamond has its own “fire and brilliance” pattern. 3) The expense per day of use is very small. But diamonds are still expensive. I spent around $5000 for my engagement ring I gave to my fiancée, a lot right now, but she wears it every. single. day. And if we stay together for 50 years (perfectly reasonable considering our age) this means that the per day usage is $0.27! 4) There are alternatives to mined diamonds. Now you still may not like a mined diamond who knows maybe the store or website is lying and it is a blood diamond. I considered buying a synthetic diamond from a place like [here]( They use large pressure cookers to form real diamonds which are a little less expensive. I didn’t buy from them because they didn’t have the shape and style I was looking for and they aren’t that great at producing pure colorless yet. But they appear to be getting better and better. Of course they are about the same price for freaking carbon, but that’s because these diamonds still need to be cut by the same artists who cut earth-grown diamonds. Furthermore you could argue that the technology needed to make these is an art in itself. 5) You get enjoyment researching and every day she wears it. Finally it was fun looking all this up knowing that she will wear what I pick every single day. Sometimes I see the sparkle of the facet pattern when we are out at a restaurant and think of how I may know the facet pattern better than she does; I know why I chose a “modified brilliant cut” over an “old mine cut” and how it suits her and her personality. Sometimes while driving her I see some shimmer on the celling of the car and think about what that means; this stone, this diamond, on my fiancée’s finger, grew in the earth for perhaps millions of years at 1800 degrees to one day be blasted out of the earth through a volcano, to then be found, mined, cut, polished and finally purchased by me and given to my fiancée. Sometimes while on the couch with her, I see some reflection on the wall and I think of the sacrifice it took to mine, produce, and ship and the cost to me and I think that she is worth it. You get to be reminded almost every day what this person means to you and at $0.27 a day it’s a steal.	1
I agree with Bonzarel. The obvious solution is to ban debt collection calls to cell phones, period. Not everybody has the same options on their mobile plans, and some have strict time/call/texting limits and/or restrictions.  	0
Very confusing if I can pay my student loans directly to DOE or to one of the many private companies who have owned my loan over the years. They continue to try to entice me to restructure the student loan debt - very misleading - without disclosure of their fees at this point I cannot even trace a $30000 fee that was double billed to my total. It is a web of confusion that I cannot escape. I intend to take my student loans to my death as I have no other way of making the monthly payments.  	1
Many of the projects of well-established associations do not consist of sending milk or whatever there. But there are a lot of associations that are doing training projects or establishing networks there - I'll continue in German, it's easier - so it's about sustainability I think. So it's not a matter of giving them everything in subsidies. What is important in all these kind of projects is that people can give up themselves - and that the values, the quality of life and their knowledge, their knowledge can be improved.	0
Yes, that's exceedingly interesting. The EuroPolis document is really well done, I want to know if the politicians who are discussing these things have all this information available. Did they take into account all that is in here and really base their decision on that, on all that information? I don't know. It would have been good to have received all of this beforehand from the people in charge. Because I have the impression that the official Spaniards are not doing their job very well, they are not very efficient in this subject area.	0
Yes, I think I should clarify again, I'm from Spain. As I said, we have experienced a sharp increase in unemployment within a few months, to 15, now to 18 percent even in some regions of the country. We also have a responsibility; I think that must also be clear; to humanity, I would say. We have to make sure, of course, that we maintain our standard of living, but we also have to find a way out. All people in the world have the right to eat, to feed themselves, to educate their children. I think we have enough possibilities here in Europe to deal with immigration, yes? And at the same time we have to make sure that the countries of origin of the immigrants can develop further; economically, but also culturally and socially. It is also a question of solidarity between continents, between countries. As I said, we should perhaps remember what Andalusia, my region, was like eight centuries ago. There was a lot of immigration, later also emigration - and I think that nobody leaves his home country for fun, but people do it out of need, because they have nothing left to survive. Hardly anything to eat. They don't necessarily do it voluntarily. So life has to be very bad, it has to be very bad for people to decide to leave their home country and that there is no prospect of improvement, that things cannot be improved in the short term in the country. I think we have to make sure that there is a greater balance between the different regions of the world. And I would also like to point out the following: Everyone has their own language and their own culture; these must also be respected and protected. I would also like to ensure that each individual is allowed to keep and cultivate his or her own language and culture. So you should make sure that everyone gets along, right? No matter what opinion we have of the other. Well, in today's time, back then, I was talking about the time 800 years ago. When, in my region of Andalusia, very different peoples, very different religions got along well with each other, that is, the Muslims, the Christians, the Jews, there was a great harmony, that has been lost. We have to try to get along with each other again, to understand each other, otherwise we won't achieve anything. And if we do not understand this situation, then we will not understand the 27 states that make up the European Union today. And only when we succeed in doing that, we will find a way out. Not necessarily in the capitals, that's how I see the problem of declining voter turnout, which is also due to the economic situation, but also to these social grievances. So if we want to achieve something, I think we have to find another way. Immigration is something we have to accept, it has to be legalized. We have to create precautions for it, find ways. In my region, too, there has been a lot of migration, emigration in particular, also to the Netherlands, to Germany, to many other European countries.	1
Maybe because I am a teacher I have the impression that such a fright or phobia came up from the fact that young people do not learn about the different religious and cultures in schools. There is a history class which is mainly based on the II World War and a brief information about the Europe and World but there is no lesson about other cultures, respect, and tolerance. This is missingd in schools. It caused that grow-up people still fear. Malgorzata, I can tell you that Muslim women can say exactly the same about you in bikini. If she was born and was raised in such a religion. I also think that in their culture, woman are treated differently than in Christian religion. However, we should take this religion as it is and just accept it. 	1
I don't believe in abusive behavior (i.e. the behavior spelled out in the FDCPA), but what this individual is saying that she owes a debt that she is not paying. Instead, she wants to be the offensive party and paint the collector into a corner using a recording device.  	0
I don't see how illegal immigration poses a housing problem for the French or things like that. I think that we should not be careful, not all of us should be careful. I think that there is immigration, whether it is legal or illegal, so that human beings want to move from one country to another, because they are going to live [...] in another country than the one they are in. And this is general, all over the world; where there is wealth, people want to go there. In any case, we can't ... a principle of equality or illegality and say that the French don't have housing because there is immigration in [...]. I believe that it is not possible to make a confusion of this kind.	0
We can compare this situation to how the black people were treated a long time ago. How the people were taking advantage of them. It was also profitable for some people but in some extent. We can not trade with people. They work just like we do and want to live just like we want.	0
That's why I say that the solution is perhaps in a school that is not denominational. That is to say that religion, being part of the private sphere, if the children go to a school that does not display religious denominations, in a certain way, the child - and the parent of the Muslim girl would not have asked to remove the crucifix because it bothers me [him]. That's it. It happens that in France the public schools are more easily accessible perhaps than in Spain. And then, if you choose a religious school for your daughter, you have to have the possibility of having a non-religious school or a Muslim school. But indeed, I understand the situation that you explained.	1
I think we are discussing around something that we don't understand exactly. If I remember what I read in the brochure, to my knowledge, there's nothing in there about how is - why is the visa granted and how long is the visa granted. Evelyne, maybe they could look into that, that maybe tomorrow at the next group discussion, we'll learn a little bit more about this visa thing. Why can someone who - I guess it's like blue card or green card, five years the duration of the visa, of the stay and then the person has to have the visa renewed. What are the conditions for that? Does he now have to explain the new history, that he also knows the language? If he has worked, surely he will be able to speak German. So I lack the basis for further discussion.	0
Collection Calls and Dunning notices (via letter or email) should include a unique Collection ID. This would be listed in credit reports for the purposes of tracking and consumers would be able to enter into a online database provided by the CRPB with the type of violation or issue. This would also make it easier for the CRPB to look up disputes and determine if there's an actual issue.  	0
"I have a creditor who begins calling withing a few days of becoming past due. They are relentless calling up to 10+ times a day. I don't call them back because once on the phone with them, they hound you until you agree to make a payment or post-date a payment. If I don't call them within about 15 days of becoming past due, they start calling my relatives and neighbors and say ""we're trying to locate xxx - do you know them?"". When they answer yes, they ask them to deliver a message to me (phone number and name). I've been told this is not illegal since they are using public information and not revealing who they are or what the call is in relation to, but this tactic is shameful. We are making an honest effort to get current and stay current, but when my neighbor hands me a piece of paper with a note on it, I feel pretty powerless. This is both harassment and abuse in my opinion and it should be addressed.  "	1
"People who won't admit to their racism are the worst kind of racists. CMV I think one of the worst and most insidious types of racists are people who deny that something they've said or done is racist or, worse still, complain about being forced to use ""P.C."" (or, as most us know it, ""polite"") language. Not only are they showing an aggressive aversion to ever bettering themselves or acknowledging any unconscious racial prejudices and hatred they might have, they actually do more to normalize racist rhetoric and discrimination that people who freely admit to their racism or the ""dog-whistle"" crowd who don't complain about black people, just ""Welfare queens"" and ""urban violence"" Everyone knows what that means and they aren't getting away with anything. I mean the people who act like talking about racism is somehow more racist than whatever racist statement of theirs they're being asked to talk about. They are the worst. As in, actual worst, and perhaps the greatest threat to the integrity and cohesion of a multiethnic society imaginable. I don't believe in criminalizing speech, but we need to accept as a society that that shit is over the line. This type of racism tends to be *very* popular on Reddit, so I really look forward to some exciting responses! (while keeping it civil, of course) In particular, I'd like to hear anyone who's objected when they were told something they said or did was racist explain why it wasn't/at least wasn't egregious or was in good fun. ETA: People who talk about living in a ""post-racial"" society are basically part of this group, if that helps clarify what I'm talking about. The best example I can think of is someone saying that a Chinese food delivery ""take too wrong"" or that a particular neighborhood or building that's not actually run down is ""ghetto"" because it's mostly black and then getting angry when they're told that's a super racist thing to do. EDIT 2: Some very angry person provided me with a way better definition, so I'm going to add that: &gt;Your ""best example"" isn't an example at all, making fun of somebody's accent has absolutely nothing to do with their race. It's the same if you make up Chinese names, it's got fuck all to do with their race and isn't even remotely racist. But let me guess, me pointing out a basic fact that you do not understand, makes me a racist that doesn't admit it, right? Yeah, bro, it does! Talking about people like that here."	0
For further reference on debt tolling:  So, again, it seems as though the SOL matters very little in these cases. Perhaps the bigger question is whether or not eliminating debt tolling should be considered as a new rule.  	0
Just because the bad feelings are fueled by anger at Monsanto doesn't mean it is conspiracy nonsense. Genetic modification is not bad in and of itself. It actually works to strengthen crops and make them better for us. But the effects of widespread uniform use of GMOs are ultimately unsafe. Monsanto's practices (and genetic engineering in general) reduce biodiversity which leads to a very unstable system, where a single disease can immediately kill off all the crops everywhere or any change in climate could have disastrous effects. If you're growing crops you want to use the best genes that have been created. You aren't going to grow a sub-par version just so biodiversity doesn't take a hit. But when everyone does that, then we have a huge food crisis waiting to happen. Genetic engineering strengthens the individual parts but weakens the whole.	0
"No it's just to say - I wanted to answer earlier. In the past with the students who came to Hungary and even to France - I was saying that the students came back because after independence, people were trained, they left, they worked. And even in France, there are not many students. There are no more students in Hungary, as in France, who come to study now because it was the agreements between the countries. The Hungarian government paid the scholarship to the students and it was the cooperation between the countries. Now in Africa, there are no structures that can work like that, there is nothing - I am talking about my country - that is, there is nothing. That is to say, the people - Mrs. Zsófia, who said earlier that they do not have the culture of work - yes, they work, but the problem is that there is such a corruption that nothing works, that is to say, the European countries contribute enough that these countries are like that. The real problem is that. That is, they cheat people, they want to - when there are elections there, they do not have democracies, they choose people from here. There are people who are contacted and then, they give them money and then well - earlier I said: ""How can someone stay 30 years in power, it is not possible? "" So, it comes from there."	0
"The agency I work for is small and follows FDCPA to the letter of the law. And yet we are still sued constantly by attorneys representing debtors. These attorneys count on the fact that it's less costly to settle than to go to court to prove that we have not violated the law. Our retail division is in trouble because we've recently lost our two largest clients -- for this reason. They're now getting slapped with bogus lawsuits as well. People don't even have to pay their bills any more; they just send a ""cease and desist"" letter, hire an attorney, and wait for a settlement to roll in. All this will lead to are more stringent rules around extending credit, which is not a good thing for the economy. If we keep going down this slope, the only people who will be able to get credit will be those who don't need it.  "	1
When it comes to me, I have some personal experience. In our country, assimilation occurs. I think I can allow myself to say this. I, for example, have a group of friends of different cultures, different skin colours and different origin. I think we need this. Each of us is a human being and blood, of the same colour, flows through his or her veins. So if one thinks there is some other god, why not? We cannot hurt others.  	1
These so called free-to-end-user alternatives (if allowed to be used) also need to be regulated. There are huge privacy concerns at stake here. My friend started texting me on a free texting app, and then all of a sudden I was begging to be bombarded by SPAM text and SPAM phone calls. I can't be certain that the Free Text App that my friend was using was selling my phone number to other people, but it was a massive coincidence. Why else are these text apps free? How do they make their money (besides a few embedded ads)? Of course these people are selling phone numbers. My privacy is not for sell. Nor is my phone number. The CFPB needs to really think about these so called free-to-end user alternatives and what sort of privacy practices these companies are engaging in, if any.  	1
"Having been recently included for free credit checking, after the Target identity theft issue, I checked my credit with Experian and found a $9,924 ""collection"" on my credit report, resulting in a 610 FICO score! I had never heard of Portfolio Recovery, a company located in Virginia. I immediately wrote to the Office of Consumer Affairs in Virginia, detailing what this erroneous addition to my credit report had done to my overall score and my ability to maintain good credit. ALL of my credit cards lowered my limits, but I thought that had been in response to the ongoing bank investigations and the banks way of getting back at consumers. It all made sense when I saw this entry. What shocked, alarmed and enraged me most is that Experian excepted this ""collection"" entry without documentation. I can assure you that none exists. However, I have been a victim of lost wallets and identity theft within the last 20 years and may have seemed a legitimate target to Bottom-feeder agencies like Portfolio Recovery (the Internet is rife with consumer complaints about their tactics and illegal practices attempting to collect ""debts!"" I intend to pursue this matter by informing our Attorney General Kamala Harris and am grateful that you are targeting an otherwise unassailable lobby. Anytime a consumer writes to a credit reporting agency, the letter winds up in Mumbai, is laughed at and never acted upon. Experian, TransUnion and Equifax should undergo a Congressional investigation, during which their anti-consumer orientation and fraudulent reporting will be noted, as well as the impossibility of restoring a former 810 FICO, once scumbags like Portfolio Recovery have been allowed clear access to ruin the credit score and compromise the professional life and earning potential of millions of consumers.

"Where in the adhesion contract does it state that the credit card agreement, an allegedly ""unsecured"" form of debt, takes priority over every single other occurrence that might happen in a person's life? Are the Philippine hurricane victims or even more recent Tornado victims in the midwest who lost their homes and their streets soon to become ""defaulters"" who are then subject to ongoing penalties, fees and interest rate charges while also having their credit scores damaged? The point of involuntary default is that an event occurred beyond one's control that has prevented them from making monthly payments of the amount they are required to make. Involuntary Default simply means the defaulter promises to pay back what they owed at the time of the default, and nothing more. I would suggest that the ""promise to pay"" tenet is constitutional violation of cruel and inhuman punishment because credit card companies literally lord over their customers without clearly mentioning their Godlike status at the time of the agreement. The correlation between cigarettes and credit cards are astounding. Isn't it time for a clear warning on credit card products that state the truth? Warning: Your promise to pay your credit card bill on a monthly basis is more important than any natural disaster or personal tragedy that may occur in your life. By allowing credit card companies to not place the warning from above in a viewable context to all sign-ups, they gain monetarily while not revealing a basic contract tenet that should be revealed. Therefore the ""promise to pay"" has been arranged under a false pretense.  "	0
I believe the most significant problem is due to financial institutions having two systems that are not fully integrated. One is the system of record that contains account level information and the second is a charge off system that is used to track events that occur after the account is charged off. Events that occur on the charge off system are normally not reported to the system of record. Also, charged off system does not or is not used for credit reporting. The second problem is a result of mergers and/or acquisitions where the financial institution only converts the system of record and not the acquired charge off system. This leaves a void as to the particular status after the account was charged off. As accounts are outsourced or purchased the reliance of information resides on the system of record and NOT the charge off system. The third problem involves a consumer who has more than one account with the original lender so the risk of one account going to a different agency or debt buyer is highly likely. Even if access by the debt buyer and collector is available, the events that took place on the account are normally not recorded in the system of record and the charge off system may have been decommissioned. As to the issue of credit reporting of disputes depends upon whether an agency or debt buyer furnish data to a credit reporting agency. The amount of consumer data currently and in the past reported to credit reporting agencies may not be accurate specific to charged off accounts and to require a chain of title would be expensive and the likely hood of accuracy would still not be achieved. Going forward I think the first focus must be on credit reporting accuracy.  	0
What did I wanted to say? Ah, yes, I think that there is no need to exert time pressure. Everything comes with time. It may take even a few generations to pass.

The Republican Party was the one that freed the slaves. The ideas and the goals of the parties change. Saying that you will never vote for another party You've also removed part of the need for the Republican party to change. They now know they will never get your vote, so why try to change in a way that would have gotten your vote? Let's use you're NSA example. What if you knew that, 100% guaranteed, the next Republican President would end domestic spying? And while he was at it he fixed poverty, crime, and accomplished world peace? An extreme but you get the idea. You've pledged to never vote republican, so it doesn't matter. Vote on the issue, not on what party they align with.	0
"Can't find the source right now, but I've seen a couple of studies that indicate that people prefer to think that there's somebody in charge and they are evil rather than think nobody is in charge. If there is somebody in charge, you can blame that somebody for the evils of the world. ""No way a lone gunman could kill a president, there must be some shadow organization behind it!"". The truth is, nobody is in charge, and nobody knows what they are doing, everyone is making it up as they go along. Scarier is that our current social structure is built on the premise that we should keep it, nothing more. As we can see clearly from the arab sprint, our social order is highly fragile and can crumble easily to the slightest of provocations. It's much more comforting to most people to think that there's some big evil order imposed from above (be it god or a shadow government) than to face the fact that the world is random, the world is unjust, and nobody holds control over it, it's all just one big mess. Nobody in the ""higher ups"" decides that a president should be killed or some buildings should be destroyed, lone crazies do it, and in some cases other people fail to stop them. As comforting as it is to think that somebody is in charge, and he has a (however evil) plan for us, that's not the case in reality, there's no plan, there's no order, there's no justice, there's no right and wrong, there is complete chaos. If that sounded too scary for you to comprehend, don't blame people who just can't comprehend that and insist to believe in some higher order, even in an evil one, because even an evil order is better than pure chaos, to some people."	1
Yes, let's say that in fact, I completely agree with illegal immigration. It's a common thing, because otherwise it's more or less illogical or whatever. On the other hand, it also lays the foundations for legislation at the European level. So what is feasible, what is not? That's it. Can some countries, here, (... ...), say to themselves, well, we'll take, we'll take this and we'll leave the rest.	0
It seems to me that the equalization of the economic levels in Europe, in the EU, has just happened and it seems to me that it would be a greater problem to equalize the level of the economies outside the EU. That is why I would like to ask you: what can we do to equalize the levels of those economies? Needless to say, we could provide them with some amount of money, in terms of jump start their economies, because it is obvious that the faster economy is progressing, the higher the employment is and then, maybe, the willingness to stay in one’s country would be greater. So my question is: how could we aid the other countries? Thank you.	0
It's the same thing Celine [CEC], right? Saying, there has to be some pressure on the job market. That's what you said Celine [CEC].

&gt;And I'm aware that many of these programs are in fact profitable, I just think that those profits should be put back into educational programs, and not into buying more fancy sports equipment. That's not where the money goes though; equipment and training facilities are expensive, of course, but for the most part they're one-off expenses, and the profits more than cover that. [Auburn might have spent more than $39 million, but they brought in more than $76 million.]( So where's the money go? All the other athletics that DON'T make a massive profit, for starters. Auburn has Golf, Track and Field, Hockey, Tennis, Volleyball, Soccer and a whole bunch of other sports that are almost costing more money to maintain than they earn. But because the Football Program is so profitable, the college can easily afford to maintain these extracurriculars for their students to enjoy. As for the leftover money, that obviously goes to the school. But if you or anyone you knew in college ever enjoyed playing any kind of sport on any level (Club, Intramural, Varsity, etc.), know that that option most likely wouldn't have been available if not for the Football (and possibly also the Basketball) Program.	0
"Several courts have held""and the [FTC] and the [CFPB] agree'that a collector who sues or threatens suit on a time-barred debt violates the FDCPA. The FDCPA prohibits, among other things, the use of ""any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt."" These include making a false representation of 'the character, amount, or legal status of any debt,"" threatening 'to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken,"" and ""using any false or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.""  It is in fact your gross distortion of the law and misunderstanding to claim that SOL are a defensive mechanism to allow a plaintiff ""to avoid being disadvantaged"" for not filing a lawful suit within a lawful time frame.

The only part that I would argue with, is the EDIT 2 part about pirating being wrong. If you truly support artists in your best ability, and pirate the more successful ones, then I would say that your attitude is significantly MORE beneficial to the music industry than those who would pay for every download. If everyone would act like you, then music could be a lot more diverse, with a lot of the billions that are currently hoarded by a few celebrities, spent on funding the existence of much more niche artists. If people would have stopped paying Billy Joel after his first million, then the rest of the money could have been spent on hundreds of other niche artists also earning their first million, instead of giving Billy Joel hundreds of million and let other artists leave the industry. In fact, I think we are already going in that direction thanks to the Internet. The celebrities of the mid-20th century sold a lot more albums than any of the the current biggest hits, yet we have a lot more indies making a living than ever. That's because when the Beatles were big, if you wanted to listen to them, you HAD TO buy an album, with few alternatives. Nowadays everyone feels entitled to listen to Gangnam Style on youtube, while the industry earns the same overall revenues, so apparently the money that Psy could have hoarded a few decades ago, is distributed between many smaller artists.	0
The best argument against forcing immunizations is respect for autonomy when it comes to medical procedures. Also, force is not always the best solution, take sanctions against drugs, or alcohol (in the past) etc. Now compare tobacco smoking - education (and higher taxes) have done wonders to lower the number of smokers. It seems to me that better information and education for anti-vaxxers would go a lot further. I think spreading good information has a better impact anyway, people understanding *why* it is necessary and beneficial.	0
"When creditor or servicing company doesn't ""credit"" a payment after receiving it and then getter further proof but still puts the victim in arrears or foreclosure, there should be fines regardless of whether it is a ""mistake"" or ""criminal act."" A grace period can be allowed but after that slap on the fines. and keep them coming every week they don't correct their problem. Basically by not crediting payment they are stealing that payment. This should apply to any ""mistakes"" or unethical practices such as deliberately or ""mistakenly"" changing around escrow, interest, principal, late fees, insurance and so forth to the profit of the collector. Heavy fines will take away the profit motive and such ""mistakes"" and unethical practices will greatly decrease.  "	0
In criteria, I don't agree at all. Because there I want to repeat again from what I said before. It's not acceptable that we systematically pull good workers, good scientists, doctors, teachers from any country in order to compensate for deficits in education - or why we would like to have these people or tolerate them, that we simply attract them and then leave this country, which sent them to us involuntarily, standing out in the rain. In other words, we are accelerating this problem that we have at the moment, because these countries will certainly not benefit from it and therefore we must not talk about criteria at this point and no one can tell me that there are countries in Europe that have a shortage of skilled workers or a shortage of workers. We have unemployed people everywhere in Europe. It is simply a European problem that we can also solve on a European basis. In principle, we don't need them. But there's also no reason to make life difficult for them, so to speak, which means that we actually have to make sure that our stable is clean so that we can then clean out their stable as well. Sometime.	0
I would like to give a short answer to that. We are already in agreement on that, not that I have been misunderstood. I meant that it should remain national, but perhaps there should be a consensus that if someone has already immigrated legally and has received a legal visa with a work permit - no matter in which EU country - then he should remain legal. If his visa expires, then it is a formality; he has worked there legally before. So you could pull together and say - as the others have already said - if he has worked before, has paid his taxes, has been integrated, has not done anything wrong, why should he slip into some illegality? Whether he comes in at all before then is already a national thing; that can decide then the own nation whether it lets him in at all.	0
Regarding the welfare state, I think that all the problems would also apply if there were no immigration, because the system simply doesn't work if we don't wage war or people simply die young, as it was the last centuries, because it simply overages and it doesn't work that people work until 60 and 65 and then still live on the state for 30 years. Just as a thought.	0

Yes, I have a suggestion to make. Maybe it would be good to deal with the questions as groups, but that we try to put ourselves in the shoes of the immigrants and see how we would feel then. That is, if we had not been born with the quality of life that we have here. And if we had immigrated to earn our money here in Europe, to fulfill our needs and the question is, what would we do in such a situation? But of course only in general. Generally speaking	0
I recently discovered that my mortgage company does not have the note on my mortgage and they can not locate the note. I am current and have no concerns on reducing the payment.

"I was sent to collection. Collector informed me that it was for and overdue insurance payment. Having everything on Auto-Pay, I overlooked the notice they mailed to me. One call to my agent and the problem was resolved. I'm glad they called and gave me the opportunity to get to root of problem before it jeopardized my good credit rating! I ""know"" the majority of CFPB complaints come from people who simply don't want to pay their bill. I know this because I have worked for a collection agency for the last twenty years, privy to all complaints we receive and very, very few have any merit. I'm by no means stating that some people don't have legitimate complaints. What I am saying is if we compare the number of complaints to the number of accounts being pursued by all collection agencies the percentage of complaints would be a mere fraction of one percent. So, how much more regulation is necessary to address such a tiny percentage?  "	1
Well, to me it means strict control, that the rules are followed, that there would be a law when you come ashore. You have a contract and you come ashore. Through that you get a work contract of course and automatically if that is not respected anymore, if the conditions are not correct, then that person should not get a work permit. If the person had a work permit in the past and the job is lost, also no longer gets a work permit. That's what I call a strict measure.	0
Tiffany, I think part of the problem is that the 2% of collectors who harass and abuse are responsible for a disproportionate share of the contacts that consumers have with your industry. Everyone (whether they owe a debt or not) has had an encounter with one of these bad apples, and then they want to take out their anger on you. And when you make an honest mistake and get sued for a technical violation, you pay the same penalty as a company that has deliberately harassed someone with 100 phone calls.  	0

This one is actually pretty simple. If insurance companies couldn't discriminate based on things like age for drivers, they just wouldn't insure those higher risk groups. If they had to charge the same rate for 18 year old's as they did for 40 year old's, they would lose money on that age group. What's the point of being in the business of insuring people if you're going to lose money doing it? Insurance companies aren't charities. Even though you may individually be a good driver, there is no way for a company to ascertain that. All they can measure is the group's statistics, and unfortunately that's where your peer group screws you. One other point: there is nothing about blackness that says anything about whether you will be a criminal or not. There are things like poverty and lack of education (unfortunately related to being black in America) that influence criminality, and that's why you might say a black man has a statistically higher chance of committing a crime in certain areas. The cause isn't because a person is black or white though. Being young ,however, does have a direct impact on how good a driver you are likely to be though, due to the way the brain develops.	0
"Debtors often respond with ""I don't owe anything"", which is vague and makes it harder to cater for their needs. If any rule making is needed, it is about the types of disputes a debtor may bring forth and the documentation needed for both the substantiation of that dispute leaving the option for a dispute to be deemed frivolous and what constitutes satisfaction of the dispute or proper proof. Otherwise, this is left for negotiation between individual collectors and debtors.  "	0
Having fun. I know it's cliche but it's true, some people have fun while drinking, and it is partly due to the drinking. For example, if you go to a club sober you might be a bit self-conscious but if you drink you might not be, and then you'll be able to enjoy yourself more.	0
So now we come to the conclusion that maybe the solution is not in the European space. No, that's what I can conclude. So the solution of the immigration problem is in the countries of origin of these people. Maybe the EU should make sure that these countries have conditions to develop so that its citizens from outside don't have to try to immigrate. This is the only solution. Because maybe they come from countries that are developed because we see the African countries, they have huge financial capacities, are rich. The leaders, at least, are getting rich. So if these leaders want to develop their own country and can do it but depends on the leaders of that country, but until now there is no African country, maybe very can solve their internal problems. Because in general, the leaders want to enrich themselves and not help the people. So that's the main problem or deficit. It's developing a system that makes sure that the population, in this case the African population, can develop themselves - not just a few, in this case it's the leaders.	1

The problem, after all, is that these people are all smuggled in illegally. These are mafia gangs that bring them into the country and there, of course, it's very difficult to exercise a certain control.

I would like to react, I find that there are several amalgams that bother me. On the one hand, Walerian groups in the same statistics notions of immigration, skin color, religion, which for me are not the same things. And a second thing, he talks about - he also reads the immigration effect, the non-rights zones. Today we talk about non-rights, about neighborhoods, ghettos, in certain regions, certain French areas where the police cannot do their job anymore. My point of view is that this is not related to the population that - to the types of populations that live in these areas but rather to economic conditions and things like that. To come back to zero immigration - zero immigration for me I understand it as zero legal immigration, which means that necessarily the immigration that will remain will be only illegal immigration and necessarily if we make a region, if we put ourselves in the - if we close the European countries, if we put ourselves in the place of someone who lives in Africa, in Asia or in South America, anywhere, where these people are in the most extreme poverty, they will have what hope of life is to come to these richer countries to try to save their life. It's - I meant, zero immigration can be beautiful in a utopian sense or actually people don't need to leave their country anymore, so don't need this suffering of leaving their country anymore, today that's not the case, there are too many differences and too many differences between rich countries and poor countries that make it impossible - it can't be applied from now and I think it's hard to apply it for a long time.	0
"There are requirements for validating a debt to the customer set in the FDCPA. There are investigation requirements in other aspects of federal law when a consumer disputes. A debt cannot simply be created out of thin air. Agencies who engage in this sort of practice are usually stopped relatively quickly and fined quite heavily (as well as subjected to cease and desist and regulatory action). The fact is, while a debt collector is required to maintain certain pieces of information and validate certain pieces of information, the consumer is not required to do anything further than say, ""I don't owe this"" to make collections stop for a period of time. Just like for debt collectors, the few that do it wrong ruin if for the many that do it right, consumers in my opinion should be required to furnish some sort of support of dispute.  "	0
You're generally right—it is stereotyping to assume that someone is of a certain gender based on what activities they enjoy and it isn't accurate. However, that isn't really how it works. I'm a trans guy and I like a lot of different things: a lot are 'masculine dudebro' things and a lot aren't. In the course of a single day I can spend hours playing video games, reading or watching shitty TV shows ranging from Pawn Stars to Hannah Montana. I don't regard any of these things as 'female' parts of me. I am inherently male. There is not other way to describe it; it is just who I am. I know that I am a man the same way that I know that I am attracted to women or anything else intuitive. It's absolutely integral to my identity. If I were to put on a dress it wouldn't tap into some female part of me because of some ridiculous notion of gender roles, I would just be a really uncomfortable man in a dress. On to your point about how we are perceived in society: you have never known societal discomfort until you have lived a day with Gender Dysphoria. Hearing 'ma'am' or 'miss' all day every day is the kind of thing that can just make you want to lay down and die as a transgender person. It may seem shallow and unnecessary to pander to what society expects of us but there are two reasons for it: one is that stereotypes are absolutely based in fact—they are really just a variation on what psychologists call 'schemas' or really quick bullet points about something that your brain can pull out at the mention of a word. Basically all those little pictures we get in our mind when someone says 'little old lady' or 'Scotsman'. The reason these exist is that they are based on truth and are your brain's way of saving a bit of time because memorising each individual aspect of each individual little old lady or Scotsman you meet is a daunting task. These are only detrimental if we grow to rely on them too much and don't allow them to adapt or expect everyone to fit accurately into our schema which will accurately describe only a handful of people. So basically gender roles are a schema: girls do this, boys do that. My little notecards in my noggin say so—and they are absolutely accurate as a *generalisation* which is why you will find that many trans people do fit these stereotypes of their true gender well. Some things fit people and others don't but as a whole we don't do a half bad job of distinguishing girls and boys (assuming we don't argue that these ideas are set in stone). Equally, there are people on the absolute opposite end of the spectrum: outliers who don't fit into any of their gender's roles. This doesn't make their dysphoria and need to transition any less valid. If you can't tell from my previous points, I strongly disagree with the war on gender roles: used correctly there is absolutely nothing wrong with them (they should, of course, never be forced on someone against their will). They exist for a reason, that reason being that they are fairly prevalent and our brain has decided 'Aha, I should file that!' However, that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge spectrum in between. It's just a basic starting point for what our brain associates with men and women. The second reason is that, for our emotional well-being, us trans folks absolutely *need* to be gendered correctly. It is pivotal to our survival. As such, there is a huge need to 'pass' within the trans community: the easiest way to do this is to dress and act ways that are typical of the gender they want to be seen as. It is a sad fact that people make brash judgments based on what we wear and how we present ourselves; however, getting the average person who has never thought about gender in their life to consider that gender is really on the inside and not the outside is going to be a long and hard battle. As such, it is just easier to conform (and realistically it is not viable for a trans man wearing make up and showing their breasts to be seen as male to the general population—whether it should be or not is controversial even within the trans community). So basically, in my opinion, it is not that a person who fits female stereotypes *must* be a woman or that a person who fits male stereotypes *must* be a man: it is that these people are women/men and as such align with some (but generally not all) of the tropes of their gender because they are rooted, to some extent, in truth. I hope this is somewhat useful to you—I'm running on no sleep so if there's anything convoluted you want me to clarify or you want me to answer other, more specific questions, then go right ahead! Edit: Typo fixes.	1

"I assume by ""free to end"" you meant the agency is on the hook for the charges incurred on that particular call. I think it would be well worth exploring. We do have situations where the consumer doesnt have a landline and refuses access to their cell. If we recieve a cease and desist order we note the account and return it to our client as such. If a consumer simply asks not to be contacted via cell we will remove the cell and send a collection letter if it is within FDCPA guidelines. Other solutions may be to send a settlement letter allowing the consumer to save money in an effort to resolve the issue. The industry certainly didn't set a very good standard and regulation is certainly needed. I think the vast majotiry of us get the message loud and clear and are making sure we comply impicitly. The effort needs to be two fold. The consumers have to be willing to discuss the accounts and express willingness to pay. After all, if everyone's debts were paid, there would be no need for a call. And that's not meant to sound standoffish. The simple fact remains at the end of the day, debts are owed and our clients want their money. Consumers must share some of the responsibility.  "	1
"While Alternative 1 seems simplest, there are hidden complications. Who defines what ""principal"" means? With revolving credit accounts, interest accrues (as finance charges) and is rolled into the balance. So does ""principal"" mean only the part of the balance that was charged by the cardholder (very difficult, if not impossible, for a collector to calculate) or the total charged off amount? I understand that it can be difficult when dealing with different kinds of debts. But I don't think this option will work for a large portion of consumer debt. Alternative 2 doesn't work because who defines when a consumer ""defaults"" on an account? Many of us have missed a payment here or there, but we get back on track. So it's too ambiguous. That leaves Alternative 3 as the most feasible, but what about accounts that never had a periodic statement or billing statement? I propose breaking down the total amount by stating the amount owed on the last statement issued by the original creditor, or, if no statement was ever issued, the original amount of the debt when incurred, and then an itemization of all debits and credits applied since that balance.

Yes, I think the EU should act as one body, the efforts should be bundled, it should also be [so], not that the individual states give the money directly to the other countries but into a pot in the EU. This can then be distributed jointly. Now the effort will be - or will be in general - to go and close the borders, which will never be closed, but we must make increased efforts to do something EU-wide with those who come in despite hidden border controls. But from the development aid point of view, it should really be like this, in my opinion, everything in one pot, from this pot it is distributed, because where there is a lot of money, there is also a lot of power.	0

Well in that case I am thinking about the example we have had in Holland. At one point we have had a dentist deficit. Maybe there are some good dentists in Poland, but on the other hand, those people required to speak Dutch. They may have high qualifications, but there is a problem with communication. Maybe it would be worth to introduce one language in Europe that would allow us to solve this problem.  	1
That's not what I meant by sealing off the borders, but I am of the opinion that targeted immigration is quite reasonable, only: We have to concentrate on those who have to think for us and concentrate on getting, among other things, people into the countries who have the appropriate professional experience, so that the work is not taken away from the lower income classes. So we have to work in a targeted way to get a grip on this. There are social aspects that come into it, but don't make a cage around it, but let others in and then do it properly and give the people who are there - the poor countries, where they say to themselves that enough has already been done to them in the colonies, that they should be given the opportunity to be able to build something in their own country and not as refugees - where you see these bad things on TV - that shouldn't be, but they should be able to develop at home in such a way that they don't have to do that; to drive here and drown.	0
I disagree on account that, before the age of 18 you are not considered an adult yet. Children in highschool *think* that they're mature and that who they vote for now, will be the same way they think in 4 years however that's probably not the case. I don't feel they're intelligent enough yet, or have the experience necessary. Lowering the drinking age to 18? I'm ok with. Lowering the voting age to 15, 16? No. The last thing we need is a politician pandering to 16 year olds with immaturity	0
another issue is an original business which isn't covered under FDCPA only needs a servicemember's military address (usually their only address), they simple replace the servicemember/customer's name with Commanding Officer on a mailing or use a unit locator and ask for Commanding Officer. Considering some of the businesses located outside of a base that prey on unsophisticated young troops, like a used car lot and it's easy to have more leverage with that troop.  	0
Without building walls there is indeed the point of people coming in legally with visas and staying when the visa expires. And there's no barbed [wire], there's nothing, and how can we deal with this - because actually a majority of illegal immigration come in - in France at least and there's no barbed [wire], there's nothing.	0
While I agree with vegetarianism, I still eat meat because I don't think it will make a difference to the meat industry whether or not one person eats meat. CMV I think the way animals are treated here is absolutely detestable. I think as humans who have access to a vegetarian or vegan diet, we have a responsibility to not slaughter animals for meat. It's just that, I don't feel like whether or not I eat meat matters to companies that slaughter animals. My problem isn't with eating meat, it's with funding slaughterhouses. For instance, when I'm at a restaurant that serves meat with a vegetarian friend, they order a salad. The money they spent still goes to a company that funds slaughterhouses, right? They don't separate vegan and carnivore money. Unless you exclusively shop at vegetarian/vegan stores for food or grow your own food, you're giving money to a company that pays slaughterhouses to kill animals. Why should I be a vegetarian then? (Please please please convince me I'm wrong)	1
Yes, I would like to say something about that as well. I myself come from Lithuania, so from Eastern Europe, and there I can definitely say that Western and Eastern Europe are still very different; of course, economically it's not so different. I think that this question does not arise at all for our country, we do not have a problem in Lithuania, we have very few immigrants. But I worked in Belgium for quite a while and there I saw what the problem of immigrants is in these countries. I know the situation in such highly prosperous countries like Belgium, Germany, France, and there you really see the problem. There you see, for example, that many immigrants don't have jobs. In Brussels, for example, there are really true neighborhoods where people only speak Arabic, no French. So I think there are policies that are not properly implemented and in my opinion I would very much welcome if we can avoid that this spreads to Eastern Europe as well. I would not welcome that in whole quarters of Vilnius only Arabic is spoken. So there I have to say in any case, there is a big difference between Western and Eastern Europe.	1
If it comes to Poland; it is a much bigger country than Slovenia. You have a very specific situation with emigration. Slovenia is a much smaller country. To my country are coming representatives of other republics. Most of them are pensioners and they are coming back to their country. Many Slovenians would like to go to other European countries to earn better money and that is the reason why we understand the immigrants’ situation in our country.	1
I think that the gender wage gap is due to the majority of women's decisions and not discrimination. CMV I know a lot of liberals are saying that women make 77 cents less than their male counterparts. However, I heard the libertarian's counter point and it's not that they are individually making less, it's just that women work less than men do as a whole. That being said, I want to say that **I am not a misogynist**, I believe women should be treated equally to men in what they do. So if a woman puts in as much hours, does as much work, and have as much education and experience she should be paid the same as a man with the same qualities. It's just that as a whole, women tend to be the care-takers. They also (as a whole) tend to chose lesser paying jobs. Ie; There's more men in engineering sciences. And there's more women in social sciences (Ie; psychology, etc). I believe that women are capable at doing whatever they want, however, women (as a whole) tend to have interests in jobs that pay less than some men do. And that is the reason why there is a gender gap. I believe we have evolved as a society to not discriminate against someone based on gender and race (for the most part at least).	1
That's it. As far as this question is concerned. I myself have experienced, at least in Germany, that there are still possibilities for asylum seekers to be recognized. However, this is linked to certain conditions. They have to have stayed in the country for a certain period of time. If possible, they must have children, they must know the language and they must be able to feed themselves. And if they meet these criteria, the asylum seekers very often become real residents of the Federal Republic.	1
I'm an atheist personally, but one good argument I've heard for belief in general is that there is no way to live your life without belief. Logic itself is 'unproveable' (or at least so I've been told, and based on the arguments I've heard). Even probability itself, based on this fact is also 'unproveable'. So why do we use it? Because we believe out of pure faith that it does work. Religious people just take this a few steps further and believe in more things out of pure faith too. Ideas of arguing itself come from belief, so why does belief in a God then have to come from arguments?	1
"I would like to say something to Sören. The main problem with all immigrants is the languages. And I see this again and again, there are families, Turks have four, five, six children. The mother stays at home and raises her children. The children don't learn a word of German until the age of six. Or hardly any German. Then they are supposed to start school and they fail in school. And thus the slippery slope is set. And this has been recognized much too late. In principle, the children have to play with the German children. And that is unfortunately not wanted by the Turks either. Also with the kindergartens. That is not enough, if for example in Berlin, there are areas, that are 50% Turks, 50% Germans. And then the Turks are together and the Germans are together and in kindergarten the Turks don't learn enough German either. That is the main obstacle to getting close to the people and even starting a discussion with them. But work is now being done on this in Germany. But this has only been the case for a year or two, and we hope that this will help us get a grip on the problem. As far as crime is concerned, this is a sociological problem. A well-educated Turk or Muslim is no more a criminal than a German. The crime rate is basically the same. Then I wanted to say something to Antonia about you. I work in China and in Arab countries. These are two worlds. The Chinese are much, much poorer, they really have nothing. The Arabs, on the other hand, still live in wealth. And I have Chinese women at home all the time, they are incredibly ambitious from the start. They go to the adult education center, learn German, and then go to the hospitals because I'm a doctor. I can mediate that. They stay there for a year, go back to China and pass on their knowledge there. With the Chinese, it is possible to have excellent cooperation. If you say you start work at 8, they are there at 8. I have never managed to say in a hospital in Yemen, I start at 8 o'clock. The boss comes at 11. And there are 30 patients sitting outside, and I treat them with a nurse. But when they ask the boss and say, ""tomorrow we start at 8 o'clock, perhaps a quarter past eight,"" he doesn't come until 10 o'clock. He just doesn't feel like it at all. I have found that it is very difficult to make an appointment with them and then to follow through with organizations. The mentality of Muslims is completely different from that of the Chinese and Europeans. And they are not dumber, the Muslims or the Yemenis. They just have a completely different structure than we do. I don't know why that is. But it is certainly a difficult population group. I know about the Africans from Sudan. They can also work well together with them. However, I must also say that I have mostly worked with Christian-oriented people. And there I also worked with an ophthalmologist who had worked there for a long time. But you always have to stand behind them and always drive them. And I would say, I'm heading for another problem now. We must not pull people out of these Muslim countries, China and African countries. But we have to go into those countries and raise their standard of living. Because they alone are not able to do it. The Chinese can do it. They are raising their standard of living. In the last ten years, as long as I have been there, their standard of living has risen enormously. In China, there is a great economic upswing; in Yemen, that is not the case. And also as I've noted, I've also been to Morocco, tourism is booming there, but they don't have their own industry. Yemen doesn't produce cooking pots, it doesn't produce telephones, it doesn't produce clothing, it doesn't produce anything. It's all imported from China. No industry at all. There are hardly any schools there. 50% are illiterate, in Morocco it is similarly high. And if they go to school and have learned something, there is no education of the students. Vocational training like in our country, nobody learns the profession of a carpenter, or then the next problem is, if they have learned something in English or German or American schools, then they study in Europe and then they stay in Europe and don't go back. That's a very big problem. They have a tremendous loss of their intelligence. Only, just the weak ones stay back there."	1
Yes. I also agree that those employers should be punished, because that kind of employer who gives a job to the immigrant does not pay for his insurance. If something happens to that person, the troubles begin. So sanctions should be introduced to punish those employers, because they employ illegally not only immigrants, but our Polish workers as well. Thank you.  	0
Most consumers have a bad taste in their mouth from the way that a select few agencies used to operate. And rightfully so. But look at it from the other side. If i owed you $1,000 debt do you really think sending me a letter would do the trick? Would you attempt to call me to find out my intentions? My point is, agencies are operating under a pretty broad microscope. Compliance with the laws is being monitored very closely now. We view ourselves at my company as extensions of customer service. If we call you, we specifically ask if we are calling a cell and if it is okay to reach you on that number. If you say no, we remove the number.  	1
There is currently dispute among federal district and circuit courts as to whether a post-default assignee of a debt comes within the creditor exception. The CFPB should issue a rule providing that a post-default assignee is a collector for FDCPA purposes.  	0
"This is precisely what lead to my filing bankruptcy. Debt buying and selling, made a debt that was 10 years old, reappear on my credit report. Each time I mentioned that the debt was time-barred. I was informed that the debt had been bought, and that the ""clock"" had been restarted.  "	1
I don't know if technology allows collectors to distinguish land lines from cell phones. It is fair for collectors to use info provided on the application for credit. Collectors should be allowed to assume that the mailing address of record is an accurate indication of the debtor's time zone. Creditors periodically request updates of contact info in some cases; this would be a good idea for all to do. Mailing address should take priority for determining time zone unless the debtor advises otherwise. As mentioned previously, people with cell phones may move from one locale to another without changing their area code.  	0
Actually there should always be more communication about specific things, rather than less. More communication from the Original Creditors that an account will be turned over to a collector and when. And when a debt collector then turns it over or sells to someone else there should be more communication about who. Just like when mortgages are sold to other servicers, the borrowers get letters informing them of who now owns their mortgage and who now to send payment to. This should be standard practice for debt collectors. Explaining to the debtor that they have turned the account to someone else and that all payment and communication should now be directed to the new guy (even if no payments were sent to the first debt collector. Because there are debtors who can't make payment now but can later, and if they start sending payment to an old debt collector via an old letter they got in the mail, then debtors attempts to actually resolve the debt go by the wayside. More communication about who/what/where/how is necessary.  	0
"This Draft Summary of Discussion fails to address the issues of confusion about the statute of limitations and how they vary among states. This is a big source of confusion in terms of collection of a debt and jurisdiction. Creating a more stanadrized set of rules would alleviate these problems. In 2010, the FTC released a report, ""Repairing A Broken System,"" which made mention of the need a universal statute of limitations. Additionally, in 2011 ACA's plan, ""The Path Forward: ACA International""s Blueprint for Modernizing America""s Consumer Debt Collection System"" also advocated for a national statute of limitations. This is something that both sides of the industry actually agree upon. 50 different states and 50 different statutes make it too confusing for consumers. I also reiterate that a compromise in terms of years can be reached. Also, debt tolling needs to be done away with. It only adds to the confusion of when a debt becomes time-barred. We live in a transient society.

yo creo que lo que dice Iñaki - que imigrantes en la poblacion reclusa nacional o una porcentaje bastante vajilidado. Yo pienso con el tema sobre todo de la violencia de genero que esto es... and in this case you see for example what the quantity is. So that the quantity has increased. Also with the amount of immigrants. And I think there are two reasons for that. First of all, is that a big percentage of the population comes from Africa, where for example the situation of the woman is not very good. And on the other hand, it is so that there is also a large number of people who immigrate to us from Latin America. And there the conditions for the woman are not so good either. So they are similar. For example, I know a friend who is a priest in Mexico, and he told me about the situation there. So the situation that the woman is in in Mexico, that it's not exactly for the best. So that it's not just because it's immigrants, it's just by the fact, it's more of a social issue here. Where just for example the woman is at the very bottom of the last rung of the social ladder. So for example in the fundamentalist countries you find that. And that is for example also the case in Latin America for social reasons, because there is already a very long tradition that it is the way it is. And as a result, I think there have been some improvements there. But is it now the case that the economic crisis, which is currently overtaking us, has now also affected the weakest, let's say in particular. And if they don't have anything left, then they may steal more. As far as illegal immigration is concerned, and especially the people who come from the Maghreb, i.e. from the front of Africa, it is the case that almost all the people who are in the mafia are Spanish. So they are all Spaniards. But they usually come from Fuerteventura and they are directly connected, so these mafia are directly connected with the Spaniards and the immigrants, they are now coming to us in Spain and of course they want to come to European soil and the EU really has to do something now. And now as far as the Latin Americans are concerned, in most cases it is the case that these are people who come from other political systems. And there, as I said, they don't have the respect for women that we have. And the European culture of course has special values and also attaches importance to equality, which does not exist down there, in these other cultures. These people are not brought up in the same way, they don't have these values. And of course they have to adapt. And they should then also try to absorb all our values and our democratic concept.	1
Legally, I don't believe that CFPB authority should stretch into this area since the federal laws do not include such a limitation. Notification to a consumer that a debt is beyond statute is problematic since that date is not permanent. Partial payment on an account restarts the statute of limitations. I don't believe that a rule issued by the CFPB can help here. Education of consumers is the only pro-active method that I see as available here. However, this education should include notification to the legal profession that the CFPB will bring violations in this area to the attention of the Attorney General in their state.  	0
"There are currently no ""teeth"" in the enforcement mechanism as well. Right now filing complaints with the regulators does absolutely nothing except get you into some database but nothing is every done about violations. Requiring accurate identification of the collector with a working call-back number should be the bare minimum. At least that way the consumer has a fighting chance of at least talking to them and trying to get erroneous calls stopped. Right now government enforcement is non-existent and completely worthless.

There is no need for these so-called examiners but there is definitely a need for courageous and dedicated attorneys determined to enforce the laws that the CFPB should pass, laws that protect the ordinary folk, the innocent, those who're unable to protect themselves, even those who may have actually failed to pay their bills because our constitution guarantees the right to our innocence unless proven guilty. We cannot allow expediency to deny us such fundamental rights. I believe there is such a thing as the Gideon Decision by the Supreme Court that provides for any accused to an adequate defence, so if any debt-collector or creditor for that matter denies the alleged debtor the right to have his day in court or to a proper defence, then the CFPB attorneys should come down hard on such violators. The principle behind any rules promulgated by the CFPB must ensure that no alleged debtor get bullied into paying up or blind-sided by the court into doing so. Sometimes, there are reasons why the outstanding bills are not paid and the consumer should be allowed to confront the creditor to resolve any complaints by the consumer before the bills are paid. It's a very straight-forward and simple situation actually. All the CFB needs to do is to enact basic regulations that protects the consumer and stipulates very clearly that the burden of proof must be borne by the creditor before any debt-collector can be engaged to pursue such debts. The debt-collector must only be allowed to follow specific guidelines when doing so and the matter should be referred to a small claims court to have both sides plead their case before the court issues a ruling, rather than to allow the claim to be reported to a credit reporting agency that will destroy the credit score or rating of the consumer without his knowledge, which is absolutely wrong. Only lawful and valid debts, i.e. when a judgment order has been made, should be allowed to be reported to any credit reporting agency, to avoid creditors and debt-collectors from using such agencies to damage the interests of alleged debtors with unfounded or unproven debts.  	0
I wanted to talk about... where are the Schengen agreements? Because we have them in the constitution of Europe. It was said that we would have a common border protection, so we are now 27. It seems a bit difficult and we seem to forget Schengen. Well, it was set up and I think that today, everyone is doing what they can with the wild immigration, especially from Africa, and I think that in the next ten years it will be a very big problem, first of all demographically because... I'm sorry, but they are proliferating much more than the Europeans, and Africa, we should rather help them at home than to be able to put them here where they are sometimes very unhappy is incompatible with our countries. So I think that this is the most important point of immigration and that, therefore, we do not have the right to stick our heads in the sand like ostriches. That's what I wanted to say. [1 :	0
I would like to take up again what Agnes said: There I see at least once a chance to make partnerships - I understood that well, so there are partnerships within Europe between individual cities and the idea now carried forward, there partnerships between individual countries of the EC and, I say now in quotes, needy countries. So, in my opinion, this should not be financial aid, but it could be aid on the technical side. I don't know, water shortage, somebody knows a lot about water management, he concentrates on this country, that would certainly be a possibility that would not be dismissed out of hand. But I would think, as you say, that it would be wrong for everybody to give their money somewhere, and then the whole thing just seeps away, that would be bad. That would be bad. And money is power, it always has been and it always will be. And then a corresponding pressure could be exerted by the EU: Do something clever, get your economy back in shape, your agriculture back in shape, so that people have something to eat, so that they don't go hungry, so that they earn money a little bit, so that they don't have any idea of necessarily having to emigrate to Europe whatsoever.	0

One more note on that, on the last thing said here. Because this is a criterion that was also applied to Spain in the construction sector, a lot of workers arrived because the work was there. The whole thing was not very well organized, but well. This is the situation that has now presented itself. There was a job offer, there was a need for workers and now it is not there anymore and now we have the problem. How could it be solved? Well, it depends. I don't know, some countries have longer experience, like Germany or France. They have been dealing with immigration for much longer years compared to us, they have had to deal with a lot of problems. We are relatively new and have not yet learned from the experiences of other countries. A missed opportunity, I guess. I don't know what France did wrong, or what Germany did wrong, that we could learn from. In Germany with the Turkish population that has arrived. I don't know what mistakes there have been. Politicians, technocrats, civil servants - there should have been more thought before certain decisions were even made.	1
I understood that you were for it. Assja was saying that she did not understand this story of illegal immigration in the sense that if the person who enters a country and is recognized - that they have not been tortured - they are recognized at the border; there is no illegal immigration. There is no illegal immigration. I would like to ask you a question: the European Union, in what terms does it define illegal immigration? Because in my book it's not marked.	0
"I'm not going to address your top points as I am an atheist who agrees. I think your second paragraph could use a wider perspective. You need to understand that there are plenty of intelligent individuals who haven't thought much about religion that aren't well versed in a variety of fields. This can be used to suggest particular arguments arguing for certain God models. &gt;Because of this I have trouble believing people who were not theistic from childhood, but decided later in life that the existence of god makes logical sense, and I'd rather not suddenly feel that someone is a bit dumb because I don't know of any sensible argument that they could have run across to convince them. There are many arguments that *appear* strong. One example that I can think of is the [ontological argument]( (Platinga's and Anselm's are the most popular in my experience). If someone were questioning their religious beliefs, coming from an atheistic starting point, and they aren't well versed in logic then the ontological argument seems quite strong. What of those that define God as ""A timeless being that is the cause of the universe"". Then all of a sudden we have first cause arguments and teleological arguments for further support. Again, if you aren't well versed in cosmology and haven't seen any formal objections to the premises these arguments can appear to very strong and support this definition of God. Arguments for design in regards to Abiogenesis are also strong at a glance. Very few individuals understand the hypotheses currently put forward or the experiments conducted. There are plenty of smart individuals who believe that there was non-life and then *bam* a single celled organism that we would recognize formed. This confusion can be used to question the probability and then suggest that there must be a guiding hand of some sort. I do agree with you when it really comes down to it that there aren't any defensible arguments when they are really analysed, but there are some that intelligent individuals can possibly accept when they aren't well versed on the failing points."	0
The state in which I practice does not allow jurisdiction based solely on where the contract was signed. As such, we limit our filings to the venues where we reasonably believe the consumer resides. The states typically define what is the proper court thereafter, whether its based on amount, location, etc. so even if there is a large judicial districts we do not have the choice to file elsewhere by local rules.  	1
yes, in view of the fact that we could do something here like as Europeans, once we have expressed our personal opinion. So the we would have to deal more with what do we do with the people who are now there and whom we can integrate. And we have to distinguish between those who are ready to integrate and those who are not. That would be one question. And the second question would be: what do we do with our borders? With our borders in Europe. Because one of the big concerns of the governments here in Europe is what do we do there. Should we close the borders again, should we open them? Because when I see the different ideas of the different political groups that are written down here by the different parties, there's a nice whole range of ideas. And the mainstream parties, for example, are in favor of flexible immigration. I don't know how it is in Germany, but here in Spain, the political parties, the most important political parties, or the most representative ones, let's say, as far as immigration is concerned, have quite similar positions or views. Since we had done a mass legalization of immigrants, which really infuriated some other European countries as well.	0

&gt; Basically you can(/should be able to) cycle That doesn't work in all climates. If you lived in a very cold or very warm place, you you wouldn't want to cycle. &gt; or get public transport to shops and places of work. Public transport takes ages to get to the same place you're going to, and it often doesn't take you there directly, but through many intermediate steps. Furthermore, it doesn't take you there where you need to go, but it takes you more or less in the vicinity. Granted, if what you propose were ever to become a reality, the network of public transport would become more extended, but I still doubt that it would be extended enough to provide a viable alternative. And what should the elderly and people with disabilities do, when the bus drops them three blocks away from where they need to be? Plus don't forget that not everyone lives in a city, and a bus cannot go to and from a country town every ten minutes. That would greatly limit the possibility of movement of people living in towns and villages.	0
Regarding this topic: The European Union, what does it do, what does it say; page 14 of the German version: border control, illegal immigration and there they say themselves that the states are responsible themselves, as our host said, and the European Union has only a partial competence and only the right to make proposals - but it is left to the states. And the last paragraph: How to distribute the burdens if the European Union intervenes. I find this whole discussion very difficult. There is probably no absolute truth or perfect solution, but if you think about Germany after the accession of Poland and the Czech Republic, car theft and crime in the federal state of Saxony has risen sharply. And this is partly due to the fact that the other countries are always a little bit poorer, even in the center? of the European Union, that's one reason and on the other hand; the border between Poland and Ukraine is more or less permeable. So there are a lot of things that are not well managed. Poland is not very interested in preventing these people from crossing the border, the Ukrainians for example, they just cross the country anyway. So, these are a lot of questions that we could ask the experts.	1
"Because credit card contracts are adhesion contracts, it is up to educated third party observers to make sure the adhesion contract is fair. If a person experiences a dramatic event beyond their control that reduces their income, it seems questionable to not allow the debtor the right to suspend the interest rate charges, penalties and fees until they have regained their income. They are still promising to pay, but since their life has been turned upside down by an event beyond their control, that should have standing in some cases. It just doesn't seem ethical to punish a consumer because their home washes down the river one day, or is burned to the ground by a wild fire, destroyed in an earthquake, and so on. It especially does not seem ethical that the credit card companies are allowed to hide how they will punish a consumer if the consumer's intent was always to make their payments and it took an act of God to prevent that from happening. Insurance policies do not cover acts of war, yet our own government allowed the owner of the twin towers to collect on their insurance policy even though 911 was clearly an act of war. I believe there have been polls that show a majority of americans are upset because the 2008 bailouts did not give them any respite of any kind. The ""Promise to Pay"" says nothing about making that payment every month above and beyond all other situations and scenarios. I believe judges have misinterpreted Promise to Pay and that lawyers like the way it is set up now so they don't want to challenge the obvious holes in credit card adhesion contracts because it could quash their own future income stream.

If they leave a message they should be required to leave the name of the company, the name of the representative, the number to call, and a reference number.

About a year ago we started getting phone calls from Discover in regards to student loans and we all assumed that it was a sales call because no one living at my address had student loans with them. Eventually we managed to be home when they called and we discovered that two of my brother's loans were sold to Discover and he was never notified. So all this time thinking it was a sales call, because Discover only gave a 1-800 number to call about student loans and not even the name of the person they were trying to reach, his loans were actually in default because Discover cancelled the forbearance he had upon purchase. When he attempted to put them back into forbearance, Discover told him they ""didn't have a system for that yet"".  "	1
"Many men told stories of being raped by women here: There are statistics on this. According to the latest CDC (US government) survey, 4.8% of all men have been ""made to penetrate"" and 79.2% of the perpetrators were women. Examples of ""made to penetrate"" are: a woman who has sex with a man who is passed-out drunk, or a woman who forces a man to have sex with her through violence or threats of violence. There is some confusion due to the fact that their definition of rape excluded ""made to penetrate"" and only included men who had been penetrated. That was far less common (1.4% of men) and was mostly perpetrated by men. However, if you include ""made to penetrate"" as rape, which you should, since it is forced sex, women are a significant percentage of rapists, and the majority of male rape victims were raped by women. You can read the report at: Here are direct quotes from the report: ""Approximately 1 in 21 men (4.8%) reported that they were made to penetrate someone else during their lifetime"" ""For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims reported only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%)."" The above, lifetime stats do show a lower percentage of male victims (up to 6.2% of all men) than female victims (18.3% of all women) although this is far more than commonly believed. However, if you look at the report's stats for the past 12 months, just as many number of men have been ""forced to penetrate"" as women were raped, meaning that if you properly include being ""made to penetrate"" in the definition of rape, men were raped as often as women. Here are additional studies that show a significant number of female rapists: 1) This academic study of university students shows similar rates of victimization between men and women: Page 412 discusses the results for men and page 414 discusses the results for women. There's a nice table here that presents the results of this study in a clearer way: 2) Here's another study regarding sexual coercion of university students: 3) Here's another study: The conclusion states, ""the evidence presented here shows that as many as 7% of women self-report the use of physical force to obtain sex, 40% self-report sexual coercion, and over 50% self-report initiating sexual contact with a man while his judgment was impaired by drugs or alcohol""."	0
The agency needs to be careful of new rules that will, though unintended, be harmful to the free market. However, it is important that litigation is monitored to ensure that the system does not allow reward with no risk. A plaintiff in a lawsuit cannot be placed in a situation where it is rewarding to sue with insufficient cause and minimal risk. Creditors and those following in the process of recovery do not need additional regulation in this area since their efforts are monitored by the CFPB. The CFPB does not need to set standards for the industry, but make it clear that only those documents provided to the court in the original filing will be considered in a CFPB review. If in the course of a CFPB review, it is found that litigation was filed without a successful verification of the facts, the CFPB could award the amount sought by the filing to the defendant of the case and a fine to the CFPB of no less than $2,000 but no more than the amount sought. This position would motivate the litigant to ensure their facts were correct before any filing took place. This position would allow CFPB to review cases filed no matter how they were adjudicated by the involved court. This review could be conducted at CFPB offices since it only requires the original filings. This review could be initiated simply based on a complaint to the agency's offices. The penalty could be adjustable based on a variety of agency standards. I would have to take more time to consider when the plaintiff was not the original creditor or a member of the recovery industry, but, again, there must be a risk associated with the reward to stop nuisance suits.  	0
"I am dealing with a debt collection company who is also a mortgage company. They are having issues separating the two types of services. They are also having an incredible amount of IT (web) problems. Their website is down, or only their staff can see it, or they cannot upload my account information, etc. Other IT issues include their System, which ""tells them"" it has mailed me documents, but apparently does not really do it. My point is, I am able to capture a lot of this using ScreenShots and electronic communication, providing a very detailed log.

I would highly recommend the use of electronic media as a formal way to communicate on both ends.  "	1

"Why can't we bring back the olden days? I have been a ""victim"" of debt collectors run amok for over 35 years. Back in the day, a debt was assigned to one collector who would pursue me relentlessly for a debt that belonged to someone else. Nowadays with the robo-dialers the collection call is assigned to the ""next available operator."" Why not just go back to the days when only one collector was responsible for making the contact?

"Based on your story, I think your claim is a bit strong. First, you need to qualify it with ""The religious people I work with ..."" Second, do you honestly think they are *incapable* of logical thought? Surely its possible that they just haven't learned about basic logic and various logical fallacies. These things can be learned. So instead of saying ""incapable of"" you should probably change that to ""don't understand."" And even then, surely your religious co-workers have at least an intuitive understanding that ""A is B"" and ""A is not B"" are mutually exclusive. And they surely have an intuitive understanding of basic logic like *modus ponens.* They may not always apply it correctly in daily life, but most people are at least capable of understanding these concepts. But they probably don't understand advanced logic concepts like modal logic (most people don't). So at the most you can say the don't understand *some* logical thought. Based on that, I think the strongest claim you can make is the following: **""The religious people I work with don't understand and apply to their life some logical concepts.""**"	0
There needs to be rules around how disputes are handled for people with the same or similar names. There needs to be a process for disputing incorrect information on a credit report as well as for handling mistaken identity with the courts.  	0
One communication from the debt collector per week is plenty. On top of that, The debt collector's phone rep should have power over the autodialer in the following way. A consumer's number is on the screen, the report log on that number is on the screen, the most current info at the top of the screen. If the debt collector phone rep sees that the very last communication does is already updated (such as waiting on a job interview with a date that is still in the future), then the debt collector phone rep should have the power to prevent the auto dialer from making the call. Not only does this prevent unnecessary hounding of the customer, it also helps prevent abusive reactions from consumers towards the debt collector phone rep because the consumer recalls their last communication and that what was discussed could not have reasonably happened yet.  	0
"Email communication is a huge advantage for all involved parties. Emails provide consumers with much better tools to control how they are being contacted. First, if treating emails as ""in writing"" (as they should), disputing a debt or demanding that collectors cease communication is much easier. Second, setting rules to hide collection notices is a powerful tool not available in any other communication medium. 3rd party disclosure is therefore a lesser concern. Third, email delivery is fast, and facilitates an efficient process, where less communications can be made to reach a settlement. Everything is in writing. Fourth, email is significantly less confrontational than phone calls and causes much less stress to recipients. Fifth, email is better than recording in keeping record of communication, making it even harder for collectors to hide acts of non compliance. Email should be allowed, while keeping the sensitive parts of the message (disclosures, personal details etc) hidden - as an attachment or as a link that is part of an email. Yes, email is more cost efficient to collectors which is why using email should be conditional on collectors not charging the debtors any fees for their payments. The added profitability should be shares with the consumer.  "	0
So, the question of whether we should close the borders or not would not arise if we were trying to prevent people from wanting to come into Europe at all. People don't actually want to give up their homeland, I think at least. They want to do that because they live in unbelievable misery. They don't have anything to eat, they don't have anything to drink, and then they probably see on television, which they have, what it looks like in Europe. This means that if we try to build up structures - economic structures - there, provide much more reconstruction aid and so on, we will certainly save ourselves some huge mass migrations towards Europe, which is certainly more favorable in the long term than sealing off Europe. We have huge borders in the east and peoples will probably migrate from the east at some point. And secondly, in the long run, you also create large sales markets. The EU is so successful, also economically so successful, because it relies on cooperation and not on confrontation and competition. Competition within, but within a certain framework. By and large: cooperation. If we try to enforce that as the EU worldwide or at least on a larger scale, then maybe we can [not only] prevent people from living in poverty on the one hand, not having anything to eat, not having anything to drink, starving, dying of thirst, but we can also eliminate problems for us and probably even create sales markets still for our domestic economy.	0
"A notice should go out that the debt has been sold because it definitely informs the consumer in how they should go about negotiating repayment of the debt. When the debt is sold, it is sold for significantly less than what is owed, and the lender gets to write it off, and the borrower takes a 7-year negative hit in their credit profile. Sometimes when you are dealing with debt collectors, the ""debt collector"" is often a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ""original"" lender, which means they get a tax write-off; you get a hit in your credit; and they still try to collect on the entire amount. If a debt is sold, then it should actually be sold to a third-party, and not a subsidiary of the original lender. And consumers should get full disclosure on who their debt has been ""sold"" to.  "	0
I strongly endore drose977's response. Currently, debt collection agencies can sell debt without proper validation. Or they can sell the debt if a consumer disputes the debt and the agency can't product the proper validation. These things should not be allowed and are very detrimental to the consumer. Consumers should be protected above collectors and other agencies as they, typically, have far less resources to fight inaccurate information. Additionally, the inaccurate information adversely effects consumers more than any other group in these situations. Collectors should not be allowed to report a debt as 30 days late if the debt isn't 30 days late. The law should include stiff enforcable penalities to deter collectors from pre-dating debt. These rules should apply for any debt reported late at any time, not just the first 30 days.  	0
I just wanted to give an explanation to the example 'apartment', that you can't use that, because the problem with this uninvited guest and these illegals - not first legal, who then become illegal - but right from the beginning illegal, that can't be solved by the EU, that can't be solved by us, that should be solved by the community of states, because if such a person immigrates illegally to our country, no matter from which country and who does it deliberately - let's talk about economic refugees, from African countries - the legal situation is that no state can reject them if their origin is not clarified, i.e. most of them do not have any identity documents - and if you try to find out in such a third country whether they really come from there, it takes years. And then you really have to distinguish between someone who has a legal visa with us, which then expires, where he would like to stay longer for economic reasons, whether you can call that illegal or whether you shouldn't rather call it something else or convert it, or someone who enters deliberately from the beginning, no matter which EU country, without giving information about his true origin.	0
I believe that passing your genes to the next generation is important. CMV I've had my view since I learned about evolution. Now I'm question its validity. It started with [this]( I think started a [thread]( on /r/childfree but no one came up with a reason good enough to change my view, then again, I don't think they were trying so it's up to you guys. I just find it very hard to believe that someone doesn't want to pass on their genes, I mean, it's what all our ancestors have lived for, it's what all animals live for, heck, some spiders let the female eat them just so they have better chances of passing on their genes. It's the sole purpose of our existence (in addition to any other purposes we have for ourselves). It bothers me to no end that many generations ago passing on our genes was important but now that we're more intelligent we're CHOOSING to not pass on our genes.	0
I was sued for an alleged debt from 1993 by NYC landlord. Judge denied him the 1600. and then his real estate/collections attorney put me into collections and the landlord got to write off a debt that was not a debt. Great for these big landlords in NYC as they play the corporate game and sue a tenant 10 times and write it off each and every time even though its not a valid debt. Its a big deal in Manhattan.  	1
"it still bothers me that ""financial literacy"" may be the escape clause that the CFPB uses to avoid the real issue. How about rewarding those of us who have tirelessly blogged about exposing the financial traps set up by the credit card companies, especially those of us who did it all on our own dime and time. Credit Cards are THE BIGGEST PROFIT MAKING scheme in the U.S., much bigger than the mortgage industry. And as the CFPB knows, any type of money making machine gets protected through lobbying. That is exactly why the CFPB was able to fine the credit card companies well over 1/2 billion dollars for aggressively marketing the credit-protector Insurance program. When something makes so much money so easily, people just can't help themselves to try and keep expanding the money making venture. I personally warned about the credit card credit protector programs almost FIVE YEARS BEFORE the CFPB made their over half billion in fines. Credit-Protector __URL__ I created my site on my own time and with no funding, and I think my warning almost five years before should matter. I also don't understand why someone like myself who created my warning so early on, with no funding, can't be compensated on any level simply as a way to energize future generations that if they take the time and show they care for something that matters, they may someday be publicly rewarded/acknowledged. I also created blogs about Chase Bank and their credit card shenanigans back in 2009. Once again, the class action lawyers swooped in and took 25 million dollars in legal fees. I didn't see a dime for my blogging even though my 2009 protest blogs probably helped fuel the justified anger by some consumers who then went on a mission to get a class action lawyer involved. Once again, I got nothing. If Government Consumer Organizations are not willing to acknowledge those who care and show it, the system may never truly improve.

Our concern now is how to fight illegal immigration. We know that some countries have immigration quotas. And we know that some labor is welcome, of course. From Africa, especially Portugal, because we need them, and from the East, from Romania, because they need them too. Do we know in some practical cases we take advantage, we benefit from some immigration, but the big concern is now to know how the EU can help us, each country to fight what for us is an excess of immigration. Those that are useless, finally. We know that passports, identity cards that arrived as tourists, become illegal afterwards because they are no longer tourists. This obviously with a certain connivance and acceptance on the part of the companies that hire these people. So to combat this, we have to hope that the EU can agree to protect us against this problem of illegal immigration. [1 :	0
Our society is geared towards white men. Part of that gearing is that their ideas and opinions are celebrated and encouraged, and as a consequence others might feel uncomfortable sharing their ideas and opinions in spaces dominated by straight white men. You can observe this phenomenon yourself! Are you in school, university, or employed with a wide variety of people? Observe how often women and people of color speak up - particularly in spaces where they are a) new and/or b) in a numerical minority. I'm willing to bet it's significantly less than the white dudes speak up. The other consequence of this, of course, is that if there's a straight white male opinion on an issue you better fucking believe *everyone* has heard it, because the straight while male opinions are the mainstream opinions. They're the op eds in your newspapers, they're the SCOTUS decisions, they're the authors of your magazine articles, etc. Sometimes it's nice to have a space where this particular viewpoint isn't belabored past the point where it's useful. Finally, 'safe spaces' can also foster a discussion between a group of people who are all on the same page. No movement would ever get anywhere if it had the first hour of any given meeting trying to explain its core tenets to newcomers. If I want to hash out the specifics of intersectional feminism, I am most likely to accomplish that goal with a group of intersectional feminists. I *ought*, if I'm a good intersectional feminist, to have a good logical justification for intersectional feminism in general, but sometimes I don't want to have to *give* that justification every time I talk about it.	0
Student Loans, Many of the problems that students are facing are with student loans from the private sector. Take for example Sallie Mae, this company has it on file that i dod not graduate from college and i did graduate. Their collections agencies are like loan sharks going to the extreme of making threats and cussing out students who cannot make payments. I know for some people it is easy to make payments on student loans but for many it is a struggle to get by. All students are trying to better themselves and sometimes they simply cannot afford to make payments. Companies like Sallie Mae are in the business of making peoples lives miserable. Their collection practices, customer service and lack of options are usually the reason why students default on their loans. Paying for college is a marathon not a sprint and these companies treat the repayment of student loans like a sprint. I think they need to offer more options to students. I also think private institutions ala the schools that lend money to students need to do a better job at giving students options to prevent default. resolutions and remedy not judgement and default.  	1
I would like to say a few things. So: first of all, this is a very big integration issue. In terms of criminal foreigners. We have done a pretty good integration work in Hannover, so not us, but the Hannoverians have done that. Over the last 20, 30 years. And in comparison with Munich, it can be said that there are much fewer criminal foreigners and that the foreigners who are there also have better access to higher education and so on. That means that in Munich, for example, it is the case that almost no foreigners go to university, while in Hanover it is still 10-20%. The second thing I would like to address is that far too few people ask why this is so, that everything is addressed here. The question is why are these people so worthless, so without values. Why do they treat their women differently, why is all this happening? Why do they come to Europe at all? And why are they addicted to alcohol? Or why are third-generation Turks so unwilling to work and so hostile to society as a whole? I can answer the latter question very well from my own experience, because I have some friends there. In our country, the Turks, the first and second generation, were almost not integrated at all. And so the third generation feels strongly disadvantaged in society, which in fact it is. And as a result, they get into a defensive attitude, which forces them, ultimately, to act the way they do.	1
Regarding the immigration integration program. In the past, perhaps European society or certain countries that received more immigration had conditions so that this immigration could adapt, integrate without problems, perhaps. This is not true today. Immigration is not an isolated problem. It is a problem of society. And it has to do with employment, of course. When there is no work or no job, a whole series of problems arise for those who have come from elsewhere. Those who want to work but don't have a job. So the problems I see are that European society does not have the same conditions today as it had in the past. To be able to welcome and to have the same level of immigration that it had. And now we have a problem of integration of a new generation. The second, the third, the fourth, those who are already here enough. Maybe that, that's the problem.	1
"In 2010 I was sued by a debt collector for a debt. At the time I was in my final year of law school and was surprised at the amount of misinformation used by the plaintiff's attorney (e.g. claiming that no proof of assignment was necessary). I informed the attorney that I would need proof that this was my debt as well as proof that his client had proper assignment of the debt. He responded by threatening (via e-mail) to interfere with my Bar admission process. I did not believe that an unsubstantiated debt would affect my ability to sit for the bar and so I stood my ground. He dropped the case (without prejudice) in Magistrate Court and then re-filed in State Court five months later while I was going through my Certification for Fitness process. As a result of his second lawsuit, the State Bar did not allow me to sit for the Bar due to ""a pending lawsuit"" about debt. He eventually also dropped the lawsuit in State Court. He never shared proof of this purported debt nor did he ever produce proof of assignment presumably because he never had valid proof of either). Nonetheless he was effective in ""punishing"" me by interfering with my ability to sit for the Bar after graduating from law school. this occurred in Georgia. Their rules for Bar Admission are available online at   "	1
I think that immigrants come to Europe because, first of all, Europe seems like a paradise for them. I am thinking in particular of Africa, they have French TV, they see French ads and they say: Oh, it's wonderful over there, all the French are beautiful, all the French have big houses, all the French have a big car, all the French have a beautiful wife - you have to go there. This is one of the first points. Europe appears to be a miracle, you have to go there. And the second point, I think that some countries have very serious economic situations, in Africa an absence of development, in Eastern Europe a [...] of development with the end of communism. So, this causes a misery which, in front of the paradise Europe, pushes the future immigrants to emigrate. So, in my opinion, one of the solutions to the problem of migration is precisely to help countries to develop in order to avoid emigration and therefore not to rob them of their elites who are the only ones capable of producing a certain economic activity in their countries. Thank you.	0
I agree. I have been harassed for years (after getting a new cell phone number) from debt collectors calling for someone else. I presume it is the person who had my phone number before me. No matter how many times I tell them that they have the wrong number, they just keep calling over and over.  	1
I do not think that we should exclude some people from this immigration policy just because they do not have relevant qualifications. Mainly because we can train these people, so we should not look for specific qualifications. We cannot accept that only highly skilled workers enter and reject those that perform functions that do not require high skills. Especially because in our countries nobody else wants to take these functions. As I said before, we can train employees and after some time, a person can even ask for citizenship.	0

The data is difficult to obtain and likely not attainable considering lawsuits can be filed in magistrate, county, state, and federal courts. Also the data could be inaccurate since a case can be postponed and renewed later. I do not know if there is any central data base for either court. Also, lawsuits are filed in bankruptcy proceedings as well so these would need to be considered as well. This is why I am concerned when numbers just get tossed out without and substance verification. Based on my experiences I would estimate about 1.5% of delinquent accounts were forwarded to filing a lawsuit.  	0
Possibly the most egregious action of all regarding credit card debt occurred in 2002, suspiciously close to the 911 aftermath. While insurance companies were paying out tens of millions of dollars to building owners who suffered damage because of 911  (which technically they should not have done  since this was an act of war which is NOT covered by most insurance plans),  the comptroller of the currency was DENYING insurance companies from competing with credit card companies in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena. The result was a credit card debt suspension insurance monopoly for the credit card companies with premiums that were overpriced by a factor of 1000% to 2000% The profit margin was so high for credit card debt suspension insurance that the CFPB actually had to fine the credit card companies OVER 500 MILLION DOLLARS in the summer of 2012 for overly aggressive credit card debt suspension insurance sales and marketing practices. I had warned about overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance back in 2008 with the creation of __URL__ but was never compensated for my efforts. It meant that MOST credit card defaults in the United States over the last 10 to 15 years were based on a fraudulent foundation of obscenely over priced credit card debt suspension insurance that consumers could not afford to keep purchasing. Consumers were literally paying for 5 years worth of credit card debt suspension insurance but only receiving 3-5 months worth of coverage! Most of the times that a judge was declaring a credit card default, they were propping up the overpricing of a monopolistic credit card debt suspension insurance policy that did not fairly give consumers the most obvious way to protect themselves from a default that was caused by life changing event We could literally fix the U.S. economy almost overnight by doing the right thing. First acknowledge credit card debt suspension insurance fraud that the credit card companies have perpetrated on the american people over the past 10 to 15 years  and as retribution reduce all consumer credit card debt by approximately 65%. Then raise the monthly minimum payment on the remaining 35% from 2% to 5%  so the monthly payment remains roughly the same but consumers feel their debt more easily going forward. The comptroller of the currency tried to get credit card companies to raise their monthly minimum payment requirements from 2% to 4 or 5% back around 2005 but relented when it became obvious too many people would default. By reducing consumer credit card debt by 65% as a form of reparations for debt suspension insurance fraud consumers suddenly have a lot less debt BUT still have to make a similar monthly payments. However MORE of that monthly payment goes towards paying down the actual debt rather than the cesspool known as ever expanding interest rate charges.	1

"These so-called ""Blue Laws"" that prohibit cars lots being opened on Sundays and liquor being sold on Sundays, requiring the debt collection industry from closing down on Sundays (no calls, no letters, no contact) would not create any undo burden as many other regulated industries (car, liquor, gambling, etc) already abide to such ""blue laws"" and they operate just fine and make plenty of profits. The debt collection industry should be required to close down completely on Sundays.  "	0
It seems to me that the living conditions in Poland - and everybody knows this - that we will simply be forced to work abroad, or rather in Germany, in our neighboring country, for quite some time, maybe even for quite a long time. At the end of the day, it's more profitable for us, we simply earn more, and in addition, the standard of living is different.	1
"&gt; but that does not warrant discriminating against every individual in the group. Rather than looking at it as discrimination, I want to illustrate that it's part of an elaborate game. To try to change your view, I want to start with a casino. Ultimately, a casino is taking a risk with every bet it takes; it has to handle the possibility to paying out each and every time. To minimize the risk, the ""house"" has a hierarchy of wagers, so that bets with a low-risk of paying out require less initial investment than those with a higher risk of paying out. Consider the roulette wheel. Because the odds that the result will be ""red"" just under half the time, such bets are relatively risky for the house. To keep from losing all their money, they are going to make sure that the payout on that is relatively low: 1 dollar gets you 2. On the other hand, anyone picking a single number has a low chance of winning, so that is a lower risk for the house. They can offer a return of 36 times the bet because the chances that they'll have to pay are really low. If a casino offered 36:1 returns on a 50-50 bet, they wouldn't be in business for long. Now, think of insurance as organized gambling. When you take out an auto policy, you are basically wagering that you are going to get into an accident someday. Meanwhile, the ""house,"" or the insurance company, is wagering that you won't. In order to stay in business, then, the insurance company has to make sure that the odds aren't stacked against them. For young men under the age of 25, statistically that's akin to the ""red-black"" bet on a roulette wheel; a very risky wager. Thus they aren't going to give big payouts unless the initial investment is high. Meanwhile, those demos with statistically lower risks wouldn't have to spend as much to ""play"" because the insurance company knows that the chances they'll have to pay out are slim. The alternative would be that all payouts would be of the ""red-black"" variety, because otherwise, the insurance company wouldn't be able to stay in business if it offered the low-investment/high-return bet for everyone. Like the casino giving 36:1 on every bet, an insurance company wouldn't stay in business for long offering the same rates/wagers to everyone. TL,DR: Insurance is organized gambling, and demographics are the spaces on a roulette wheel; not everything is going to pay out the same."	0
Your source doesn't exactly seem that neutral on this subject, and I'm having a hard time finding numbers on this that aren't from a conservative/Republican source. But I also have a question: what differences are there in the way a liberal bias manifests versus a conservative one? I ask because other than MSNBC and the much larger FOX, I don't see that many that aren't a blog or somesuch, where the bias is blatant. How many are simply a more-or-less neutral outlet that one might read a scattered article and detect some kind of bias one way or the other? by what metric do you decide an entire outlet or journalist to be biased as opposed to the assemblage of facts on a single article?	0
Let's start by assuming the creditor provided something for which a consumer agreed to pay. Creditors should be entitled to get a phone number and address at which the creditor can reach the consumer and to get updates as long as a debt is outstanding. If a consumer chooses to use only a cell phone, the creditor and collector should be able to contact him at that number.  	0
The debt collector must be required to submit the original application for credit with the consumer's original signature and the original letter of approval for the credit. The debt collection company should be required to submit full documentation that the debt actually exists. Too many debt collectors rely on falsified affidavits.  	0
"I have experienced a debt collector call me several times in a day although they have already got the voice mail. Even if I already have spoke to them and told them my situation and created a ""payment date,"" they call again the next day. I do not know if the system is talking to each other or they just have that ""auto dialer"" on and just calls all day and every day. It is abusive and on hte verge of harrassment. Not to mention, the time that they call is 10pm or 9pm. I believe that is too late to call and there should be reasonable time to call and based upon the time zone you LIVE IN not based on the area code of your mobile phone number.  "	1
Mslade, you have some valid points about the confusing Foti rulings, but I think you are wrong about the TCPA. This law has always applied to debt collectors, politicians, and even charities with respect to cellular phones. And it's not just one judge who has ruled in this way. The FCC and the courts have repeatedly affirmed it.  	0
I have experience collection companies who buys the debt from the 1st 2nd or 3rd party add on its fees along with the other companies fees,then submit a new account number to the original account as though it was a new account. So, a original account for the sake of argument was $500.00 turns out to be listed on your credit report as a $3,000 delinquent account. Government laws should not allow this practice to exist. What ever the original account is that's what should be reported not interest and additional fees a collection company deems it can add to your credit bureau report.  	1
"what kind of consumer contacts do debt collectors... disputing the debt. That presumes they actually follow the law and do a validation investigation. That is wrong, they do not. I sent a letter to a company claiming I owed a debt and I was clear I was disputing the debt. A clear, declaratory sentence. I mailed it to the address listed. There was NO PERSON who signed this letter to me. I had to send it to To Whom It Concerned. But it was clear I was disputing the debt. I did so within two weeks, well within the 30 days. Yet they did nothing but wait 30 days and send me a letter saying ""here is the info you requested."" It contained nothing I recognized. You are presuming they are actually validating. This is the biggest mistake. They do none of that. Any rule that defines what qualifies as a dispute would help. The clearer, the better. The vagueness now has led to abuses. Such as ""frivolous and irrelevant"" disputes. That is a license to abuse consumers.  "	1
They didn't say a thing about it. They contacted him via phone since he was homeless at the time and told him they were taking him to court. They didn't even tell him which debt it was for initially.  	1
I think the solution to this immigration is going to be through Europe, or it's not going to work. It will work through Europe, or it won't work at all. So we have now eliminated the borders because of the Maastricht Treaty, and if one country allows foreign citizens in, and in excess, then all countries accept that, there are no borders anymore. And we are all together. And for the good of all, so at the moment we are in an economic crisis, and that is then always the immigrants, they are then most affected by it. And they always say then that's the fault of the immigrants. And so the crisis seems to be long and difficult. And given this situation especially as we have it now in Spain, so that's really a financial debacle at the moment with us in Spain and so there is a sharp increase in unemployment and personally I'm afraid that in a few years... because today we still have unemployment, but there is still social and financial aid and if all the people who are now in unemployment, if they no longer get social subsidies, then it's first of all the immigrants who will then suffer the most. And not enough thought is given to them, so we have to take measures in the European framework and also take measures uniformly. And one of the big problems of the EU at this point in time is that we really have to adopt and adopt some uniform guidelines. And of course that's difficult to achieve that unanimity because countries are just different because of their culture and so. And they don't want some issues to be dealt with jointly with the European without... and then feel that you are interfering. Yes, how many are we here now? Are we 17, 18 people? 17 people. And we all have our opinions, we all often have different opinions. Now imagine how difficult it is for 27 representatives from different countries to come to a unified or unanimous result. So representing more than 400 million inhabitants, 500 million even fellow citizens. It is incredibly difficult to reach agreement and consensus. Above all, to reach unanimity. It's almost impossible. Yes, and for the problems that affect all countries in the same way, and if, for example, one country makes a decision, that then affects all the others as well. But then the decisions have to be made by the EU, not by the individual country. Because if you belong to such an organization, we have the advantages, but we also have to transfer part of our sovereignty to the EU and then Europe must really take hold. We have to be less Spanish, less German, and more European, at least in such important areas. At least on such important issues.	0
I think that everything is based on financial issues. According to what our colleague said before about the not rich countries like Poland where many Polish live whom the state cannot offer much: The state is not giving them many opportunities for example to have a good education, healthcare, because he cannot afford it. So it is going to be very hard for the state to also find money for the illegal immigrants. Here, the monetary policy should somehow be terminated. Especially these quotas we were talking about before. From where shall we take them to help immigrants? It is hard especially for the poor countries which cannot always help its own citizens. Though, there are the richer countries who can afford it.	0
i agree. their comments are outrageous and is just more of the same. why should we expect a lobby group of debt collectors to really want enforceable new rules?  	0
Yeah well, but what you're asking yourself, these are people who fled their country and what happens afterwards? Suddenly you don't need them anymore. You think, yes, now everything is going wonderfully in Iraq again, but it's not true. Then suddenly they are considered illegal immigrants and we have a problem.	0
I wonder why people come to us and if they live well in their country. Do they live well in their country? There must be a reason why these people come to us.	0
I'm in agreement with that statement. Having worked for a Sheriff's Office where we served many debt collection processes, I found that not much effort is made to locate the proper address for the defendant. When we would find the defendant had moved, we would return it not found. However, the same cannot be said about private process servers who go out and post processes on the door without confirming they live there.  	1
"I don't think that any social drinking (alcohol) is justifiable. CMV I am unaware of any positive effects of drinking alcohol even as a social lubricant. At various levels of intoxication, it lowers inhibition, reaction time, focus, vision, and decision-making capability. I put more emphasis on the last one listed, decision-making, since the lack of judgement due to alcohol is what causes many of the anecdotal mistakes I have read/heard. Therefore, I find it baffling that anyone would consciously choose to drink alcohol for any reason any other drink (or even any other ""action"") could also fill."	0
Validation should be obtained from the Creditor by the Collection Agency prior to any Collection attempt is made by the Collection Agency at the very least. It would be even better if the Collection Agency would give notice of validation at least 5 days before any attempt is made to Collect. This notice would give the Consumer a narrow window to contact the Creditor directly to satisfy a debt that may be outstanding or to inquire about the details of the alleged debt before making a good faith payment to the Collection Agency. The rules of Evidence Judicial Procedure should be horned during the validation process. With out meeting some measure of the burden of proof all functions of Debt Collection is simply a burden to the Tax Payer, any proceedings with out court worthy documentation would be frivolous. If Custody of the debt is transfered form a Creditor to and Collection Agency the Contract must be available for the Consumer or Custody of the debt by the Collection Agency should be invalidated. Privacy should be respected. When it come to mortgage debt; Upon the issuance of a mortgage form a bank the bottom line banks holding do not decrease. In essence The bank has written new currency (guaranteed by the future payment of the Property taxes, and other Taxes placed on the individual Citizens of the United States of America backed by there Social Security numbers and property deeds) in to existence. Essentially the Borrower is giving the full amount of the mortgage plus interest to the mortgage lender. If the FDIC truly backs Lenders, The lender should maintain the documentation of the agreed debt and a Default should be handled by the FDIC. Outsourcing to a Collection Agency can compromises the custody of the debt and encourages harassment of the consumer by a 3rd party. May Fraud be Minimal and Prosperity be Abundant.  	0
I agree with Sasha, not because of the immigrants the criminality increased, especially in the charge positions. Today, we have an economic crisis and the situation is more difficult. However, we have problems with gypsies. 	0
Yes, maybe to ask a little question: This documentation, I didn't read it very thoroughly. It is not clear to me what the common policy of the European Union is. So I don't know this immigration policy perfectly. I already know some national accents, but of the European Union, I don't know what are the main lines of their policy.	0
Consumers should be aware of who is handling collection procedures. The seller of any consumer debt should be required to notify the debtor of which debt owed to which creditor, is being sold by xyz organization to 123 debt collector. The effective date of the debt sale and contact info for the new collector should be included.  	0
Let’s take the example of a welfare state. If all the people were on the same level, everything would be different. For example in Sweden there is a tradition of a welfare state. In Sweden if somebody drove the car too fast, he is getting a fine immediately and this fine is proportional to this person’s earnings. It is how it works in Sweden. However, you said 10%, for me it is not a problem. If all people paid why not me. If someone imposes on me such system, then why not. The point is that not only me. In Sweden everyone is paying for such purposes. Of course Nuca, we cannot solve in 5 minutes all problems of this world. 	1
Yes, that's quite right. But as we read in the document here, one of the main problems with illegal immigrants is that they start with a legal contract but then they enter the illegal sector. The legal contract expires and then they continue illegally, without a contract practically. So people who come to Europe mostly want to stay here for good, not just do a temporary contract and then leave. They want to enter the European system. They don't really want to fit into the culture, but they want to use the economic advantages and not really appear as Europeans. It is very difficult to send them away again, they are hard to find. Yes, I know that it is difficult there. But I also know that there are many immigrants, most of whom come as tourists. With a one-month visa and then they stay here as illegal immigrants. But these are then different phenomena in the individual regions, but there are also many, for example, who work in agriculture. Some of them have a temporary residence and work permit. But I am convinced that there are many immigrants who would then return to their countries if they had the chance to gain a foothold there again. There are many illegal immigrants, but they don't return to their countries, because if they did, they wouldn't be able to go back to Europe to work again for a while. I am convinced that if we could give them work and control them better, that they would return to their own countries and then they could come back for certain jobs. If they knew that they could come back next year to work here temporarily, then maybe that wouldn't be such a bad plan.	0
As a Director for Collections now for Kennedy Space Center Federal Credit Union, which is over 500 Million in asset size I try as I have for prior union to file suit closest to the Consumers current address. One method is to assign over to an attorney within the current residence-venue of the Consumer. In legal terms we attempt to get service when filing a suit out of state, its method is called obtaining if possible a Alien Juddgement outside from the County and or State the contract/note was originally signed. There are states in the Union that do note accept foreighn judgments. So recording a judgement obtained for example in Floirda and rerecorded in another State may not be possible.  	1
Yes, I'm quite tired. That's why I didn't talk much. And also I have little experience from my own life on the issue of immigration. In the Loire region, we are not so much exposed. But what I want to point out is that if there is unemployment, it is structural unemployment. It is there because the system of economy, the market needs to function in tense flow with too many people as workers. So it is the immigrant as well as the nationals who pay. It's a bit of wishful thinking to want to make one work like the other. In any case, there must be some on the cargo ship. I think that's the question. Do we want this system? Otherwise, I wanted to say that I am quite happy with the debate we had together. I think that as citizens we are quite open to foreign populations. That's what I feel when I listen to you. And personally I think that there must be something that I don't think about. It's the financial question. Why countries are digging into this aspect. That the reasons of the migrants are legitimate. If we don't welcome them, is it because we don't want to share our wealth? Well, that's the question that I think we should explore.	0
Immigration is always associated with crime. It's always said that they don't want to integrate, they refuse that help, they don't want to participate. But I think it depends on how you treat the immigrants. We have people in front of us. And now you try to exclude them. So I think you try to put them directly into groups and I think that's not right. You can't say immigrant equals criminal. Now how would they react to claim their rights? We have that in Germany, for example. With the population of Turkish origin. There is a negative look on this population. So there is an exclusion, there is a rejection in the society, and that was a fact.	0
I believe allowing unrelated topics to be part of the same bill is damaging to the legislative process. CMV It is a common practice in the introduction of legeslation to include completely unrelated issues in an attempt to get them passed as part of the main issue. For example, one party might want to pass law A, but not law B. A second party wants to pass lab B, but not law A. So when the first part introduces a bill on law A the second party will tack on law B in hopes that the first wants law A to pass so badly that they'll be willing to allow law B to slip through. A recent example was anti abortion legislation being grouped in with motorcycle safety laws. I find this disruptive to the process. By forcing politicians to weigh the merits of completely unrelated issues against each other, the consideration given to individual issues is diluted and good laws get shot down to avoid the passing of bad, or vise versa. Change My View. **EDIT:** My view has been changed. Thanks to /u/thedeeno for pointing out that this is how minority interests get their views noticed and pushed through despite little interest. Also to /u/floorberry for pointing out that this is a way to get around using a LOT of time on small and (to the greater body) unimportant topics such as relatively small allocations for infrastructure upkeep. /u/treseritops made a similar point very well. Also, thanks to /u/auandi for pointing out that the House *already* has a rule against this, but it's effectively castrated by the normal political structure.	0
"I would like to see the time frame for validation change. I, as a consumer, have 30 days from the date of the letter to dispute the debt, however, the collection agency can take as long as they want, even years, to get back to the consumer. This practice is not only bad but some charge interest on the debt, even though they don't call it that (fee's""), all the time they are 'looking into it"". If I have 30 day's they should have the same time frame to get back to me, period.  "	0
I don't know if I understood you correctly or not. I take my daughter to a religious school. So, a Muslim comes to this school with his daughter and he doesn't agree with the crucifix in the classroom. And it has to be removed. So, I have to adapt to this Muslim. Why? If I don't believe in this crucifix, you have to take your son to another school, that's how I see it. If I take him to this school, it's because I want to, it's because I believe in this religion.	1

Notifying consumers of the sale of their debts and related details would help consumers with identifying who is contacting them about a debt; there are robo calls about lowering your credit card interest rate and such that are solicitations. Consumers have a right to know who they are dealing with in relation to their financial affairs.  	0
I would have a question for the Germans. Aren't the third generation immigrants already in Germany. And then are they still considered immigrants even though they have German citizenship and were born in Germany?	0
When I introduced myself, I said that I have personal reasons that I came and I wanted to add something to Marianne when Romania was not yet - there were a lot of illegal immigrants who came to Romania and it is because of these immigrants who came to Romania, that many of my colleagues lost their jobs and their employment. At the moment it is because of this immigration that I have lost my own job and he is in Hungary - I am not saying that he is illegal, but he accepts a salary that is much lower than the salary that we could have. As far as the Chinese are concerned, for example in Chinese restaurants it's very often a big problem that ownership is not acceptable.	1
Recently, courts have held that debt collectors can escape 1692i's venue provisions entirely by pursuing debt collection through arbitration instead. As the NAF studies reflect, arbitration has not proven a satisfactory alternative. I urge the CFPB to include in a rule language interpreting 1692i as requiring debt collectors to proceed in court, not through largely-unregulated arbitral forums.  	0
So, immigration is easy to solve. If we put ourselves in a country like Ecuador with 0.50 euro cents per day to live, I guarantee you that we will not have any more immigration. That's why I advocate zero immigration because we will always have people who will automatically feel attracted. But if we have zero, we will only have two or three percent, it will be manageable. If you say bring me a few, there are others who come after. We make zero. We know very well that will happen. Why? Because it's a little bit like lights - we do the same as his people - yeah, we're not going to starve in our country ? But I mean we can't take in all the misery of the world. Is it us, to be European. We have the guilt of being European? We will give our salaries in these countries so that they live. No, it can't work like that in my opinion. Good charity begins with oneself. I think we are not responsible for the misery of others. Our politicians are, but not us. Our politicians, certainly. But I am not a politician, no. I am a worker. That's good.	0
I think that in Poland are not many immigrants. I guess, most of them are coming to my country from Ukraine and Belarus.  However, people are also crossing Poland to get to the EU countries that have a better standard of living. Especially now, when the borders are open. Before they were also crossing the borders, but illegally. At the moment, it is much easier for immigrants to cross the Polish borders and get to other Western countries such as Germany. Thank you. 	1
As a mathematics and computer science major, I personally study best from doing practice problems over and over until I've sharpened my intuition as well as my working knowledge of how the tools I have learned relate to each other. This process takes much longer than a few hours. In abstract mathematics especially, knowing the definitions simply isn't enough to be ready for an exam. You have to know how to attack problems, where hangups and issues can arise, and you're racing against the clock for the entire exam. Without having done practice problems to get me in the zone, I will not be prepared. Yes, all the homework I do over the course of the semester is good practice and helps me learn, but you move away from topics quickly and it's very easy to forget how to use certain definitions and ideas if you haven't touched them for a few months.	1
"So now we're going to bury the dead and we're obviously going to treat the living. That's what they say, well, that's what Marques de Pombal said after the great earthquake in the 18th [century]. I disagree with that. So why do I disagree? These people, these immigrants, were needed for a period of time. They worked in the fields. They picked melons, for example. I only talk about Spain, because that's what I saw in the report. Because Spain is a very pragmatic case. Well, it's clear, it's real. I have nothing against ""nuestros hermanos"", Spanish people, but these people worked, legally or illegally, I repeat, make a difference - I don't know. But while Spain was a great economic power, these people helped the country, well Spain developed, built roads and so on and so forth. And now, when they are not needed anymore, they are given a little ticket. Here you are, go home. But look at it this way: If these people had been protected, if they earned as much as the Spanish, of course, it's in the merit, you earn more or less. Yes, but I do not agree that the work of an immigrant is paid less than the work of a Spaniard. No. Unfortunately, this is what has happened. Immigrants earn less. [1 :"	1
I was never informed by Bank of America that they sold my credit card and closed the card. When I realized it, I paid it off immediately. During that quarter, after long illnesses, my Father and Mother both passed (within 31 days of each other) and frankly, credit card payments were not in the forefront of my thinking. ALSO, just because a bank or credit card company has been exempted from Usury laws does not mean they do not commit the violation! THAT needs to be stopped!  	1
"Additionally, as loans are set up on varied systems and they fall in to collections for calls to be made a break-out of phone types should be part of the ""Solutions"" .

I don't think that is the solution, I hear there isn't room in the jails to put all the bill collectors. A lot of the multiple calls problems come from an dialer calling, if it doesn't get an answer it will call back later.  	0
When my twins were a week and a half old we took them along with us and our older two kids to see Cars 2. They each fussed for about a second when it was feeding time, but then we gave them their bottles and they shut up, ate and slept through the movie. When the movie was done the people that we were near said to us they didn't even realize that we had the babies with us. I think banning anyone is a stupid idea. But everyone needs to be respectful of other patrons. If one or both of my babies had been fussy and inconsolable I would have taken them out of the theatre immediately. If my older kids started being disruptive I would have taken them out of the theatre and given them an earful (cause they should know better). Edit: I wouldn't bring a toddler to the movies. That's just a terrible idea.	1
I agree with you. Even in such a small town like Malbork, which counts 40 thousand inhabitants, I have observed that there are many changes, for example restoration of streets, sidewalks and building an entertainment arena, so I can see an improvement as well. Thank you. 	1
just the phone number should show up on the called ID. The consumer can google the number and figure out if they want to talk or call back the number. More importantly, it gives attorneys the ability to make fdcpa claims against collection agencies since we know who is calling.  	0
There are a number of reasons that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 1. Eating first thing in the morning stabilizes blood sugar levels, which regulate appetite and energy. 1. Breakfast is thought to play an important role in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 1. Breakfast can be a good source of vitamins. A simple meal of processed cereals can provide vitamins and minerals which people can find it difficult to get elsewhere with just two meals a day. Now, this doesn't mean that a breakfast of pancakes and bacon every day is going to be healthy, but there are a ton of easy recipes that you can make to get your day started off well. * A whole grain bagel with cream cheese * A bowl of whole grain cereal with milk or yogurt and a side of fruit * A bowl of oatmeal (I like quaker oats, you just put oats and milk in a bowl and microwave for 2 minutes, add a bit of cinnamon) * A fruit smoothie or breakfast smoothie ( If you're in a time crunch you could just have a protein shake or an apple or something easy like that. It's all about getting in the habit, just takes a week or two of being disciplined before it starts to feel natural.	0
I am saying that collection agencies cannot be trusted and more often than not go beyond their job scope. Some act as loan sharks and not collection agencies. I also think that their behavior is criminal when it comes to making threats against consumers and harassing people with disabilities and seniors. So, yes i think criminal charges should be pursued for their cover ups and harassment. Also other violations of privacy and fairness.  	0
"The most common consumer contact my firm receives as a dispute is the comment by the consumer on a call with the agency that ""it's not my debt"". While that may be a true statement in some cases, some proof from the consumer should be required as to why the debt isn't theirs. For our customers, proof of residence at a different address from where our service was provided is usually sufficient for us to remove that customer from the debt. The consumers must understand that they have to work with the creditor or agency to correct whatever info lead to an ""incorrect link"" (common name, bad SSN, fraud...). The 3 items listed in CFPB summary is usually adequate.  "	1
"This is an awesome suggestion! Your suggestion ""I don't think they should be allowed to call ANY number for more than 3 months without successful contact with the debtor"" is spot on! And I can't believe that no one else has ever suggested this before. 3 months (or whatever an appropriate time limit is) would reduce the constant harassment that I and many other innocent parties receive. This morning I received an illegal phone call from a collector at 6:17 AM with a spoofed phone number for a person that I have never known and I have told these collectors this several times already. They have the wrong number. And I am tired of this. The CFPB should absolutely implement a rule that forces unsuccessful contact to 3 months.  "	1
The politicians listen to the people were advised. I don't think, so that's not happening in Denmark especially. Because if you look at what's happened in the last few years, you find that the politicians have listened to the people. A line has been drawn, a debate has been held about integrating migrants into our society. I would like to say that some countries tend to think that the woman should take care of the house and the children and not put her nose outside the door. But that is certainly a big problem. The children who then grow up with us in Denmark are influenced by this and we see that Muslims have an influence. Then of course they become more moderate, the Muslims who come to us. Because they see how it works here. They get jobs, but they are very smart, they can work very well with their hands as well as with their heads. What I would like to say is that the problems in Denmark are solved by setting up a crisis center for women. Young women from Muslim families can come there and they don't want to be forced to marry someone they don't want. There are people who want to swim against the tide, they don't want to take on the role that is performed [presented] to them.	1
"This Draft Summary of Discussion fails to address the issues of confusion about the statute of limitations and how they vary among states. This is a big source of confusion in terms of collection of a debt and jurisdiction. Creating a more stanadrized set of rules would alleviate these problems. In 2010, the FTC released a report, ""Repairing A Broken System,"" which made mention of the need a universal statute of limitations. Additionally, in 2011 ACA's plan, ""The Path Forward: ACA International""s Blueprint for Modernizing America""s Consumer Debt Collection System"" also advocated for a national statute of limitations. This is something that both sides of the industry actually agree upon. 50 different states and 50 different statutes make it too confusing for consumers. I also reiterate that a compromise in terms of years can be reached. Also, debt tolling needs to be done away with. It only adds to the confusion of when a debt becomes time-barred.

I think it's a very interesting topic. There are many nuances, I for example could go on talking about it until midnight but I think time is running out and we need to put some order in this discussion. So I propose the following: This afternoon, we will only talk about legal immigration, tomorrow morning for example we will talk about illegal immigration and also I would like us to fish out a little bit the arguments given in the documents we have in front of us because I think there are really very very interesting arguments in there.	0
"I am a clerk at a local city court. I am the civil clerk and I feel that debtors are treated extremely unfairly by debt collection laws. The Court cannot give legal advice so it is saddening to have to try and explain and console upset litigants who have no idea what they are in for. I think there should be more avenues for pro se litigants who cannot afford to retain a private attorney (which is 95 % of the litigants in my city). I can say that most people do not answer summonses because they either were not properly served or they just straight up do not care, or most often, do not understand the legalese. BUT, I do have to say that I get many litigants who call and ask what they do now that they are served. On the occasions that people do file answers, most of them are in letter form, not a ""legal"" verified answer. Most debt collection attorneys jump right on that and request a summary judgment. Our Court does not turn away letters, and we send a copy to the attorney and set the matter up for a pre trial conference with a judge or court attorney to help try to get both parties together to come to some sort of resolution. The Court does have to adhere to a scheduling policy for these conferences, but we are very flexible if a defendant has a scheduling conflict we try to accommodate them as best we can. When summonses are filed with the court, half of them have tons of information about the debt, others only have the amount due! I find that sometimes it's hard for litigants to obtain further proving documents from attorneys, even with the court telling them they have to. When entering default judgments, I take my time and examine the whole file, like comparing the contents of the summons/complaint and the default judgment submitted, re-checking the affidavit of service of the summons (to make sure the defendant had the legal time to answer the summons), and ensuring that attached to the default judgment is the proper documentation as to purchasing the debt, a non-military affidavit, etc. I also make sure that they are being charged the proper interest rate and court costs. The bottom line is that the debtors still do not have enough and/or sufficient laws to protect them, and the Court's hands are tied based on these laws, even if they wanted to help, they couldn't. I know the Court is to remain impartial, but in a small city, everybody knows everybody and sometimes it's hard to see these practices occurring.  "	1
Patience is the number one option. Agree to contact the credit card company and have the debt reduced to what it was at the time of default. Agree to even a 5 dollar monthly autopay with the promise that eventually it will be increased. Then report the account in good standing to the credit bureaus as long as those five dollar payments come in.  	0
Social market economy is just a slogan. I've been a cash cow for 46 years - plundered, cheated, deceived - and I'm at the end of my rope; I can't take any more, I have nothing left to add, and if there's more to come, who's going to pay for it? Health insurance? Who is going to pay? I have to pay. The bosses don't pay; I pay. And then we are supposed to pay health insurance for the whole world - how is that supposed to work?	1
So I don't know what your impression is but anyway, as I got all these proposals and when I read them, there are pros and cons but it seems like these last areas - but anyway, it's hard to make a decision because you can easily sign all the arguments in favor but also against. But I think it is a long term problem and at the same time a short term problem - I think that until 2030, due to the migratory change that we are going to live, we need 25 million immigrants until 2030, so at that time, we could immediately think of man as a commodity but on the other hand, we need this man, this commodity and therefore we have to be prepared, we have to be ready to welcome these people that we need. So, in any case, I read somewhere, we need more than 20 million people from third countries, outside the European Union, to satisfy our own market. This is the long-term problem, but there is also a short-term problem, which Micheline mentioned: What can we do? I think that nobody is doing enough at the moment to welcome the people who are already in our country, but it must be said that France has been a land of asylum for 200 years, a country that has always welcomed foreigners, But we have also noticed that for two generations now - more or less - we have really had problems in France with immigrants and at this point we should ask ourselves the question, what are we doing in the short term to be able to welcome the people we still need and what are we doing for those who are already here? These are two very different problems. But we should approach it very slowly.	0
I believe that Marriage as a lifetime commitment is an outdated expectation. CMV I think that the Till Death Do You Part idea of marriage is simply not supported. Most marriages end in divorce anyway. In my own family, my great grand parents divorced, so did my grandparents and so did my parents. I don't know what should replace the lifetime commitment and expectation of monogamy of Marriage. This is an important question because I want to raise a kid someday. I believe the economic and financial stability of a two parent household is probably best for kids, but I have no interest in monogamy, nor could I ever pretend to believe I will want to be with the same person for my entire life. Edit: Oh, view changed, I have been away from reddit for a while.	1
As there can be a substantial monetary impact from incorrect entries on a credit report in the form of higher interest rates or being unable to secure a loan, bonafide disputes should NOT be allowed on a credit report.  	0
Have you've ever read a book, or a series of books (like Harry Potter or ASOIAF) and felt depressed when you finished it? When that happens to me, I look on my bookshelf and pick something completely different from what I just read because I know that anything similar wouldn't be enjoyable (such as reading Harry Potter after ASOIAF would be too similar to each other - both are fantasy after all - but rereading Ender's Game wouldn't be too bad). Essentially, you need a rebound game. Something so completely different from Dark Souls that after playing it for a few days and weeks you'll be ready to dive into skyrim or bioshock again, and really enjoy it too! For me, the best games would be Civ 5, Kerbal Space Program, or Surgery Simulator 2013. The last two are so silly that they take the depressing pain away.	1
A simple solution to all of the hype about calling cells which is by far the most common means of contacting a consumer these days. Direct that all telecommunication companies offer a site that allows the agencies to register their phone numbers. If a call is placed to a consumer that does not have unlimited calling or testing then the charges are reversed to the registered phone agency.  	0
[JOS] was saying, for my Romanian colleagues, because in the history of Portugal there was a less pleasant moment in the past and he was referring to that moment. I say this for my Romanian colleagues especially. So a historical problem that I will not go into now. And he referred to this historical moment and to the illegal immigration of the Portuguese. Because Portugal had at one time a system of dictatorship. But I agree with him, because each country should decide on immigration at the level of the parliament. [01 :	1
Rather we are talking about the specific support for legal and illegal immigrants. These people need papers. Surely we all know that even though we pay the insurance premium, from somewhere we need to take all the money. Right? So for people that are excluded, we need to guarantee them access to social care, social benefits…So now we need to establish some rules consider each case separately. So or we send immigrants home, or we provide them with decent conditions to live in this country.	0
no, I think it would be better to do it as a group, because the concerns in Germany are different than the ones here in Spain. And I don't want to create a negative spirit here by dividing it up. But everyone has different concerns in their own country. And the questions can therefore also be different. So the idea now is to do this as a group, and we will proceed as follows: Alvaro?	0
A credit reporting agency should be required to immediately comply with information regarding disputed debt and completely remove any reference to the debt. As an example, I am attempting to have a time barred paid lien removed from my Credit Report. 2 of the 3 bureaus immediately removed, 1 refuses to remove. I have sent documentation from the court, the original creditor, from the office of probate judge all to no avail. Without a remedy, I am left with a false item on my credit report.  	1
well, the philosophy of Islam is based on theocracy and not democracy. It makes a difference. It brings a different worldview. Because there, you base yourself on the morality that comes directly from the Koran. The way of thinking is quite different. The idea of morality is quite different. In Tenerife we have had many problems. So I'm a teacher and yes with the veil, there were some problems. The young girls come to school with the veil. If we want education and we want democracy, then what? Then everybody has to be equal. We said we don't want the veil to be put on and then the children were not sent to school. Rather that than that the parents would have allowed the veil to be dropped. Then the children don't go to school anymore. That was the result. In the Canary Islands, of course, we live with tourism. The Germans, the English come to us. We are a friendly host country, but there are demographic pressures. And it used to be quiet with us, but that quietness is gone. And then to the prisons. To the criminals that were addressed. Our prisons, they are hotels, so that is very different in our country than in other countries. The people are fine. They have food, people are taken care of, that's not so normal in our country. Regarding the Turkish residents and their integration: we have a problem with Eastern Europe, with people who came to us, to the Canary Islands, and there we tried to integrate the people, we had teachers who were supposed to remove the language barriers. That just to make it possible that the children at least know the local language.	1
(... ... ... ...) I would say that it would be absolutely necessary that we all have the same conditions within the EU under which we regulate this question, because due to the open borders within Europe, a shift of the problem will take place again and again anyway. And therefore, within the EU, we should also have, I would say, a common legal situation that regulates something like this in the first place. And in this respect, I find such a discussion, as we have it here, necessary, and can only welcome that, I say, then also to coordinate, where is the consensus between the different national solutions, then evenly.	0
States Rights versus Federal Rights are the biggest issues with the rule making process. There is a vast divergence of state law requirements that create areas that confuse consumers, regulators, and those in the industry as to what laws apply in what settings. A universal rule that would apply in all settings would assist all parties to remove the ambiguity and conflict that currently exists with state multiple levels of regulation at the municipal, state, and two regulators at the federal level  	0
I believe there is nothing wrong with urinating in public. CMV. I believe that laws banning urinating in public are based on 19th century moral values, and discriminate against those with small bladders. I live in London, and I've often had to stagger home from a night out for over an hour on the tube. Even if I empty my bladder before I leave, it's entirely likely that I'll need to go again before I reach my final stop. Unfortunately, there's often no choice when caught short on public transport, or waiting for a bus late at night, so I'll have to have a piss on a tree, or in a drain, or a dark corner somewhere. However, I know that if a policeman caught me, I could face an £80 on-the-spot fine. Now, I'll concede that urine doesn't smell particularly nice, but that shouldn't be a problem if public urinators take a little time to pee on soil down a manhole or whatever. Urine is perfectly sterile, and poses no health risk. Furthermore, I would argue that complaints about having to look at someone weeing (and possibly catching sight of their genitalia) are as immature and repressive as opposing public breastfeeding. And also, would you rather I took a leak on a tree, or that I pissed my pants on the train? Ladies and gentlemen, please change my view.	1
Yeah, I was listening and I mean it was very interesting. Everything that was said here. Around the table has been very interesting. I personally feel very well integrated in Denmark. I think the problem of illegal immigrants is certainly a problem that should be regulated by the respective countries. I am talking about asylum seekers in particular. We have now chosen quotas. We had in the past people from Tunisia who were embarked from [...] also in Denmark, and what is also important is that people come to a country as guests - and that is the case for asylum seekers as well - they should be grateful that they are allowed to come there. And then they certainly have to respect the rules that apply in the country. That is, I think, very important. And when the children of these immigrants come to the schools in Denmark, then they are no longer considered migrants, but there is probably little the EU can do about that. Which leads to a whole bunch of countries having to make a special effort to sort out this problem. And it's really very complex.	0
With regard to this ghettoization, I would like to say that it's up to the residents of the city themselves that no one else wants to live there in that area and then the housing prices and rents simply drop and then people move in who can afford it because, for example, they don't have such a good education and then have a job that brings a lot of money - for example.	0
I think we can all agree with this, it is just right. However, if it comes do various religions, for example in Holland there is a tendency to forget about tolerance. So often, they want to foist something on us, so that we would live in the name of their religion. There were even murders on religious grounds committed by them. So we believe that Muslims, I am talking particularly about them, think that there is only one religion – their religion, and we have to appeal for tolerance. I think that there is a lack of tolerance from the side of the other party and that is why there are so many conflicts within our society. 	1
When the borders were open, criminality has dropped. I live close to the Western border and before the borders were open, criminality was much worse. Now, there is no criminality at all. At least at the western border.	1
No we are not talking about the Polish language. This is not a synthesis. I think the most important here is a labour law, the European Labour Law. To have the same labour law in all the European Union countries would allow to jointly regulate immigration problem. 	0
"Every debt I've ever had go in to collections has supposedly been given notice in advance. In the case of 2 hospital bills many years ago they claimed to have notified me by mail several times but I had never even received the initial bill let alone the follow ups. Since I was insured at the time I only had to pay a reasonable co-pay and would have readily done so had I gotten the bills (as additional information, in both cases I offered to pay at the time of visit and was told they only bill). This particular hospital has an ""in house"" collections department so I get the impression that they often neglect to actually send info to patients so that they can then collect the additional fees and interest as profit. When a debt is turned to collections I feel it might be best if a mandatory 30 day notice outlining what the debt is for, previous contact attempts, amount due, available options such as payment plans and the exact effect of the collections process on the debt is sent to the person in a manner that is trackable and shows the intended recipient had the notice in their possession-perhaps a registered receipt type of delivery.

Wow, I didn't even know we had those rights except for the one about the workplace, they're all news to me. So I've no experience, but my guess would be that the debt collectors would rather not receive this information.  	0
&gt; I think people who live on the street need help, even if they dont want it Many people actually enjoy this freedom. They enjoy traveling, working in different locations, etc. [Hobo's are 'workers who wander,']( and even have their own ethical code. I don't think it's right to force them to conform to societies expectations, i.e. living and working in one place. I personally have moved between several states in the last few years for job opportunities. If a State had suppressed my ability to move, I likely wouldn't have had the ability to learn new skills, and become more valuable. &gt; Large denominations of vagabonds are drug addicted, and need therapy. Many are runaway children from broken homes with no life skills, and need guardianship. A large number are insane, and need to be evaluated, medicated or put into an institution. And let's be honest, many need a shower. On top of all that, a fair number are criminals, concealing weapons (two of my friends got stabbed/bottled downtown by beggers) But this is a reason to arrest the ones that break the law, not the ones that are over all good citizens who just like living on the streets. If anything, we should make it easier for people to live on the streets without being harassed by police officers. It also raises the notion of why people live on the streets in the first place. Is it zoning laws, lack of unaffordable housing, restrictions on structures (i.e. tents are illegal), [because so many psychiatric facilities were closed in the middle of the last century, with no laternatives being created]( etc, etc. Rounding up homeless people and putting them into 'reeducation' centers does nothing to stop new people from becoming homeless, or to address the underlying mental health issues that often *can't* be treated with drugs or even therapy. &gt; While the responsible citizen in me recognizes the danger in giving government power to ship off people into detention/forced care, I can't help but feel that some people need it, especially against their will, if their freedom will lead them into drug addiction, crime, prostitution, illness, unplanned parenthood and potentially death. If you think people need help, you should donate your time/money at homeless shelters, or helping homeless people in other ways if possible. There's absolutely no reason to give the Government any power to round up *more people*, especially with their current track record of putting people in cages (re: [The Drug War]( Perhaps if the Government had a track record of *actually* helping people out, instead of making situations worse, they would be a good candidate for this task. However, I see no evidence of this, and think it's best to let people do what they want, so long as they don't hurt other people.	1
Sir had said that these leaders in Africa are very corrupt but what is corrupting them? Is it us who are spreading this corruption? Or, what do you think? What is the basis of this corruption that exists in these countries?	1
In Belgium, so to speak, the situation is differentiated. The number of illegal immigrants who work is relatively big. They work illegally, because they live illegally and those people are often taken advantage of. These are people who live in centres for asylum-seekers and have problems with finding a decent work to earn a livelihood. There are also many of those who have started the asylum procedure and do not live in asylum-seekers centres, so they work on the market, but very often they work with no permit, this is the situation in Belgium. 	1
"I believe Obama should be impeached and tried in civilian court for the unlawful killing of US Citizens in drone strikes. CMV. As the title says, I think President Obama (and any others directly involved) should be impeached by Congress, subsequently removed from office, and tried in civilian court for (at the very least) murder for the killing of US citizens in overseas drone strikes. It has been well known for quite some time that the Obama administration has used drones overseas to kill certain targets, and that some of those killed were United States citizens. This is no longer something that people discuss and the government doesn't comment on; the administration has now admitted to the killing of four **US citizens** in drone strikes, three of whom were not targets. Sources: My main argument stems from a reading of the Constitution. The Constitution represents a contract between the Government and The People. I find the following excerpts to be particularly important in this case (listed in order of applicability, with emphasis added): ~~Amendment XIV, Section 1, Paragraph 1: &gt;**All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States** and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; **nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.**~~ Amendment V: &gt;**No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury**, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, **nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law**; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. Amendment VI: &gt;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the **right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury** of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and **to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence [sic].** Article III, Section 2, Paragraph 3: &gt;The **Trial of all Crimes**, except in Cases of Impeachment, **shall be by Jury**; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Article II, Section IV: &gt;**The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of**, Treason, Bribery, or other **high Crimes and Misdemeanors.** (Online source for quotations: In my understanding of the Constitution, ~~all four~~ three of the fatalities were unlawful. ~~The killing of Anwar Al-Awlacki should be classified Murder in the First Degree, as it was clearly premeditated and he was not tried, so the killing cannot be deemed capital punishment.~~ The killing of Al-Awlacki can be justified by saying he was an enemy combatant, the capture of whom would have been infeasible. However, if the three were accidental as claimed, they are still felony manslaughter. Such felony level offenses are gross abuses of power, and must fit the definition of a ""high crime"". This, in my understanding, makes it obvious that impeachment is an appropriate course of action, and, if the Senate finds the defendants guilty, they should then be tried in civilian court, since the offenses are against other citizens of the United States. Change my view. **EDIT** /u/Jazz-Cigarettes changed my view on Al-Awlacki, but I remain unconvinced that the other three deaths are not impeachable offenses. **EDIT 2** As /u/Tyrelxpeioust pointed out, the XIV Amendment applies only to the States (and so is irrelevant here), while the V Amendment is relevant."	0
So the Jürgen again here. I have to thank Mario, because he hit exactly the right words. Point number one is that you should really check who is coming, how long [is he] in the respective country, to what extent is he needed. The most important thing is, what qualifications does he bring with him? And I think that's great what Mario said, it was complete. If you behave like that, then we are where we actually could have been already. Because then we have the most qualified trained and the ones that are needed. What was said correctly was that last year about 5500 doctors left Germany. Towards Denmark, towards Sweden, towards England. Because the question is asked: Why did they leave? From Germany, to Spain and Spain among others. Because they are simply better off there in terms of working hours and because financially it has improved for many. And I just wanted to tell Jens privately that he lost his document when he arrived. Thank you.	0
I would like to add something. The standard of living in Germany is higher than in Poland, so it is understandable that the cost of living is expensive. I may give an example from my area and a few specific examples, but may I calmly maybe also give my example: So I, what I earn and then all additional expenses, so I get gross 2000 zloty, which corresponds to 500 euros, so a quarter approximately, and if I then deducted the insurance premiums and other indispensable expenses, I am left with just half, 1000 zloty and a square meter of living space costs six zloty, so that is, I do not know now how you can convert that. I'm just trying to put it into a logical context with what I find out when I move, because a Polish family has to spend about 90 zloty on electricity alone. So you can do the math yourself that the cost of living is disproportionate. So I don't agree that living in Germany is more expensive than living in Poland, I can't understand that.	1
I think beards are disgusting. CMV I have friends who have huge beards that they're incredibly proud of, and every time I see them I think it's just gross. Whether the well-groomed, short type or the long lumberjack-y growth, beyond the stubble stage it's all kind of weird to me. Nothing about them seems manly or rugged. I've heard a variety of responses to my view - some agree, some think that I'm going against some unspoken tenet of manliness. I've been most surprised to hear women that find unkempt, large beards attractive. I'm a man and I can't imagine doing it. I've bypassed the stubble stage into light beard territory before but I always reach a point where I start being bothered by it. What's so great about it? Why are people attracted to them? Why do people want to grow them? CMV.	1
The US actually had a policy of forced sterilization in the 1900s. Check out the Buck v. Bell case. Basically, this resulted in many women (mostly minorities and lower class women) being labeled as 'mentally retarded' and being sterilized without their consent, when they were in fact NOT mentally retarded. While I don't disagree that people with severe mental disabilities shouldn't have children, our history of forced sterilization shows that such a law would leave itself open to abuse.	0
"I would like to see strict regulation of the so-called ""skip-trace"" vendors. These are the companies that debt collectors and others hire to provide them with contact information. From my own personal experience (common last name, many debt collectors after me), I can say that I believe that I'm at the mercy of these vendors. They gather all sorts of information about people without verifying any of it, as far as I can tell. One debt collector told my state's Attorney General that they hired one of these vendors who provided my phone number as a valid contact for someone with my last name and first initial. This person was a stranger to me, but the debt collector wanted me to pay the debt. I think that these vendors should be strictly regulated and use a research tool other then the phone book to gather their information. They should not be able to provide ""valid"" information unless it really is valid.  "	1
That our politicians missed it, who were thankfully brought in after the war in the fifties; it was missed that the next generations, that they would be better integrated. And that was missed. But now we are in a position again, I would say, because of the economic crisis that we all share, to roll up our sleeves and start all over again and say that we will integrate them. And that starts with the fact that everyone who wants to live in the individual country is first ready to learn the language and is willing to do everything for the country where he would like to live, so that the country is doing well enough, so that this migration of peoples, which has been going on for over a hundred years, slowly settles down, just like the Portuguese employees go over to Spain or to us, as was rightly said, the Polish employees would like to work in Germany because it's about the money, they would also much rather want to stay in their own countries, if the economy was so strong that they didn't need to leave at all, that they really only temporarily, maybe, I say, the three four weeks for the harvest, but this of course also minimizes jobs in the countries again. As Thomas rightly said, it's a problem, who can bend over eight nine hours stabbing that asparagus? I have already tried, it is very exhausting, but thank God I stand full in the bread, I tried it once to see how it actually goes.	1
I'm with Massachusetts on this one. Repetitive and robo-calls are annoying and not productive. Another fact about robo-calls is that their messages often start in the middle, or maybe this is done on purpose. When it has happened to me, I just hang up. Policies regulating the number of contacts made within a specific time period should include all modes of technology.  	1
Eventually I was, there you go - to make economic aid for example for countries that develop economically and that limits their immigration to Europe. I totally agree, it's positive, but I think it's mostly for the African continent. In the case of China, it is completely different: In China, they already have this economic development, the Chinese who leave China to come to Europe, it's not because they are poor, it's because in China the problem is different, and therefore it's not by helping China - which doesn't need economic aid at all - that it won't limit Chinese immigration, so it's true that we really have to moderate the solutions we want to put in place to limit illegal migration because it's not applicable in a general way. It's really, I think, something that needs to be done so reacting between countries, one country and Europe, rather in a way of making a general policy.	0
Payment processor Visa has general information and the corresponding state statutes about the 10 states that prohibit companies from charging credit/debit card fees located on their website. Texas, which most people would think would be business friendly, is actually really consumer friendly when it comes to these fees, for example. Texas has had a long-standing state law against credit card fees, and just recently this year created a new state law to cover against debit card fees and other stored value cards (like prepaid debit cards). __URL__ __URL__ __URL__ __URL__ And, no, I do not have any knowledge of if debt collectors are charging debtors payment processing fees or not, but if they are--especially in the states that forbid this practice--they should not be allowed to do so. And I further believe that in the remaining states that do not have any laws forbidding credit/debit cards surcharges, that a fed reg/law should forbid debt collectors in all states from doing so.	0
No, what I meant was, the basis of the regulations should be the same. With a lot of nuances though, and reservations for the individual countries. The situation is already different, I agree. It has to be differentiated depending on the country, but the basis should be uniform in terms of regulations. That would be good if it were the same. Many problems could be avoided right from the start. And I insist: temporary immigration is also a reality. From the experience I have, I know that even Spaniards were very much temporarily on the road to work in France in the grape harvest. But people wanted to go back to their own country for a few months when they knew that they would be able to work in the European country again the next year without any problems.	0
I would like to say that the decision is taken at the level of each country, at the level of Europe, that can be conceived. I think it would be more effective if it were a decision taken at the European level. But above all I would like to say that personally I would like to express my disagreement with the policies that have taken place at certain times, in certain countries, of legalizing illegal immigration. Because it happened in France, I think it happened in Spain, it happened in Italy, it happened in several countries. These movements of legalization of illegal immigration are calls for a new immigration. And then, above all - in France, for example, I was flabbergasted to see at the time of the last movement, where there was talk of legalizing illegal immigrants, to see to what extent the demands of these illegal immigrants were in line with those of the bosses? Practically, we have bosses who have gone on hunger strike, right? Or strike movements to defend the legalization of certain illegal immigrants, because of course, what interests them is to have a workforce to pay as little as possible. And the ability to make profits is much more important. This was true in the restaurant industry in France, I remember the bosses who went on hunger strike in France, to legalize the - I had never seen that, in France, in all my life, I had never seen bosses   defend immigrants. So I think we have to say once and for all that this policy of legalization doesn't lead to anything, because afterwards, we have the same number. So we have to find ideas in our order, that's it. That's what I wanted to say.	1
"To the first question, due diligence is a must. Even if collectors are allowed to continue litigation (which I do not see going away,) there must be a penalty for the collector if false claim is made. If a collector starts litigation and it is found to be against the wrong person, compensation and additional penalty should be paid by the entity initiating the litigation in the form of a reasonable fee to the victim and an additional (and substantial) fee to the governing authority to help cover oversight expenses. To the second question, I believe an overwhelmingly large portion of consumer debt can be repaid. However, there are always going to be exceptions to this. In cases where debt can not be collected for whatever reason, it should be written off as truly not collectable and no not be allow to be sold again as debt to be collected. Fine tuning and definitions of ""Not Collectable"" will have to be worked out by the appropriate oversight bureau or agency. To the third question, both party's must be measured. There are currently established credit reporting agencies to monitor the consumer side of this issue and an additional, numerical evaluation score can be added to the consumer's already established credit report. That would be a starting point that can be expanded on as the system is fine tuned. The collector, on the other hand, would require a new measuring system that would not only score the company as a whole, but the individuals taking part in any debt resolution activities. For successful examples of such a system I would direct you to the Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and their Compliance-Safety-Accountability system. Admittedly, their system is much more complex and dives much deeper than would be required for the debt industry. However, their point system is valid and flexible for future change. It would also allow for measurement of the initial creditor. Such measurement would give the government and investors a better idea of a given business' risk level. Add to this mix, the recommendations from Mr. Bartmann and you have a system whereby collectors and financial institutions will better regulate themselves to achieve an ethical and responsible outcome and not hide behind the ""what I did was legal"" defense. It would be a Win-Win for both sides and bring many consumers out of the debt death spiral. Lastly, the federal government could implement this system with a minimal impact on state autonomy. It would reduce the number of litigation in state and local courts, thereby motivating the states to take part.  "	0
"They could at least start with address and area code of debtor""s phone number. And I would say that the reach would be at least as far as the local commuting area. So for a city like Boston, there's Boston, Chelsea, and the other surrounding areas. Now, if a debtor from NY traveled to Boston for the marathon, for example, that would be much harder for a collector to have a reasonable expectation of a debtor""s whereabouts. But once a debtor has identified his/herself within the reach of the commuting area of the place of emergency, then perhaps the exemption period should kick in. In a place like Newtown, or Colorado, if a collector has a reasonable belief that a debtor may have been an employee of the school or movie theater (if they can't identify the debtor being in the local commuting area by address/phone number), then they should also stop collection for the exemption period. So, place of employment, address, phone number, and debtors self-identifying their whereabouts, could be ways that debt collectors could/should have reason to believe the location of a debtor.  "	0
I currently have an alias on my Credit report that I have NEVER gone by. I've disputed this serveral times and I can't get this alias and the related debt off my report. As such I want federal laws that REQUIRE an agency to produce some paperwork ,legal document that proves a consumer used that alias on a credit application/paperwork. When disputed with a CRA they should be requesting this information from the agencies as well. CRA's should be the neutral parties and be the enforcing agencies on both sides. CRA's should be mandated to report accurate information and be responsible to gather the accurate information. currently they are warehouses of bad information that err on the side of collectors. Consumers do not have a reliable agency fighting for their rights. without enforcement Federal laws equate to a bunch of useless words on a paper.  	1
[Yes, I have another question] and that is here in the booklet where it sort of says: Which immigrants are we talking about, the legal ones or the illegal ones? So about the illegal ones is it about the non-EU countries, so about those who are not in the EU countries? Because I think it's kind of very opaque otherwise.	0
It apprears that the debt collectors of the debt collection industry are conducting a money laundry and racketing operation by explointing and obtaining monetary from comsumers for products that they don't sell to them or services that they don't provide to consumers with no inital purchase contract with consumers. It appears that debt collectors are obtaining monetary from consumers where they don't have licenses to sell products to consumers or provide services to consumers. It appears that debt collectors are costing companies money when companies are trying to recover their loses when they miss payments from their customers for the products that they sell to their customers or the services that they provide to their customers with alegal purchase contracts. It seems that debt collector are relying on companies' money and on consumers' money for an income when they are not initially involved in the a company sale of products to consumers or in the distributing of a company of services to a consumers.  	0
I have been contacted about a collection agency that stated that an old prescription charge was unpaid. The total was like $1500. When I asked for proof, I received a piece of paper that had three numbers on it that added up to $1500. Nothing more. Literally. When a consumer asks for proof, they should at the very least receive a fully itemized listing of what it is is being collecting upon. (e.g. a detailed statement of account, or the un-paid invoice(s). Additionally, consumers should receive documentation as to why they are legally responsible. (E.g. an agreement that they signed. I realize that for businesses that traffic in unpaid consumer debt this is going to be a huge burden as this information has long been lost. Too bad. At the very least, this should be the standard for any debts incurred after a certain date.  	1
1009 I am talking to the neighbour in front of me, but as far as I am concerned, I do not know. In Holland for example, persons who had been living for ten years in this country, and who are not legal in there, I think they should have a right to obtain a legal stay. Well, it is not, so to say, a perfect situation. There are many political debates on this issue. In some cases, I think that we could apply selective immigration in order to fight against a peculiar habit of illegal immigration. We have signed for example, a petition for people who had been living in Holland for a long time, and they were granted a legal permission to stay. 	1
How, for example, can we gaze at Islam people? We can see more and more mosques and enormous loudspeakers which are hanging from those buildings. I think it will be a problem. It may be even a serious problem, because I have been in Turkey many times and I cannot imagine that one could build a catholic church there.  So how far can we go with accepting and assimilating other cultures? Now, continuing this thought, do you think that Arab people want to and are able to integrate? 	0
I'm not completely convinced of that either; I don't see it that way. In fact, I think Poles are rather tolerant of immigrants. It also seems important to me that the immigrant consciously, willingly adopts or accepts the culture that he now experiences in his new host country, and it would make that easier, of course, if he feels respected and if he then also - at least psychologically - accepts the conditions in Poland. There are some immigrants who find that difficult.	0
Yes, I have to say that in France there is a lot of money dedicated to general training. And in particular to the training of young people or people who are unemployed. And training is not, I would say, the clique [...], which necessarily allows entry into the world of work. There is still a lot of competition in terms of getting into the workplace. Then there is still a lot of unemployment in France - at least when I talk about what I know. And there are organizations, such as the AL? in France, which is the authority that allows appeals on discrimination. And regularly, there is discrimination in hiring for reasons other than the level of training. So it's still more of a cultural difficulty than a difficulty linked to people's skills.	1
Calls at work are too instrusive. Most companies, like mine, do not allow personal calls. Not all people have M-F 9-5 office jobs. If you work in a warehouse, a production line or as a cashier, you cannot take calls and it can cause issues with a supervisor. As someone who has answered a company phone, you can tell a caller that the employee cannot take calls or that they don't work there, but that caller will repeatedly call back. My position on this is simple, if the creditor does not call to confirm employment before credit is issued, they should not call after the debt is in collection. If they confirm employment then they could also inquire about the communication policy. Personally, I am in a position of constant public contact with no available phone with me and it would be hard to immpossible to have a phone conversation without leaving my work area which would cause issues with management for my job.  	1
"You are a liar! I have been harassed for over 5 years by companies looking for someone I have never heard of because this person put a random string of our area code, local exchange and 4 numbers together (that turned out to be my number) on a loan that he then defaulted on. I have told them to stop calling, they have a wrong number, and guess what"" 5 Years later, they are still calling!  "	1
I agree with the French colleague. I would like to add one more point. What Europe does not have yet is a total integration. A good example of total integration was the Portuguese immigration in the 70s and 80s. So these are immigrants who finally acquired the French culture. There is perhaps has this of the years ... is an alliance with the culture .... Me, I think that the Portuguese are a community respected in the man. I think that it is the same respected in all the world because the secret was the tolerance, the humility, the work. And above all work. We agree that all communities contribute positively through work. This community is accepted in all countries. In America, China, anywhere. But that's not what this is about. We are discussing regional details or local details of each. No, there are problems. It's not the work we're discussing here. If everyone contributes positively - I am talking about immigration here - through work and then accepts the culture - and here I am giving an example. We had the examples of Portugal and the Africans, but... I want to give you the example of the gypsies, for example the gypsies. They are stateless people. Who are going to register and therefore have identity cards, whose minority is now being defended. Because it's not logical, but it's fashionable. And so people always contribute negative stuff. Drugs, counterfeiting, etc. and then they go to look for what is called minimum income, benefits for children and maybe when in France the same thing happens with the Arabs with the risks to women. well, for me they are people that procreate [?] Loves everything. They are going to cry children, to make children and after we are going to see the allowances. It is not a policy, it is to destroy the culture of a country! And one can really let put in this spiral will destroy itself in a term. I think that there it is always work. From a whole of nations and in all cultures and in [...] an integration, leads a plain integration. The 27 countries are not yet totally integrated, and then there are still some iniquitous towards the decision of the EU and then we have in Portugal Brazilians and each one its regional problems. Well this question of illegal immigration, some future problems in fact. But they are necessary, very difficult and drastic measures. [23.16]	1
But that's the illegal work area anyway, they shouldn't be working at all, they shouldn't be hired. They get almost nothing but they shouldn't be working for that anyway. When someone is hired in Spain, the rules are the same for all Spanish workers. Regardless of their nationality. As soon as they have a work permit, they automatically have an employment contract and then there are also collective bargaining regulations and Spanish regulations in that sense. So they have labor rights like any employed Spaniard. They have a wage, they have working conditions, just like any other worker if they have a legal employment contract. If foreigners have a normal labor contract, they don't get paid less.	0
"In 2010 I was sued by a debt collector for a debt. At the time I was in my final year of law school and was surprised at the amount of misinformation used by the plaintiff's attorney (e.g. claiming that no proof of assignment was necessary). I informed the attorney that I would need proof that this was my debt as well as proof that his client had proper assignment of the debt. He responded by threatening (via e-mail) to interfere with my Bar admission process. I did not believe that an unsubstantiated debt would affect my ability to sit for the bar and so I stood my ground. He dropped the case (without prejudice) in Magistrate Court and then re-filed in State Court five months later while I was going through my Certification for Fitness process. As a result of his second lawsuit, the State Bar did not allow me to sit for the Bar due to ""a pending lawsuit"" about debt. He eventually also dropped the lawsuit in State Court. He never shared proof of this purported debt nor did he ever produce proof of assignment presumably because he never had valid proof of either). Nonetheless he was effective in ""punishing"" me by interfering with my ability to sit for the Bar after graduating from law school. this occurred in Georgia. Their rules for Bar Admission are available online at __URL__"	1
As someone who regularly reviews credit reports, I am appalled by a practice I see regularly. Debt Collectors frequently resubmit the report of a debt as delinquent every month . This will have a highly adverse impact on the consumer's credit scores.  	1
"If I have been falsely served or subserved, (the making up of a person who does not exist to claim a service, or simply stating ""Jane Doe"" received the service) and the judges don't care, and the debt collection companies don't care, I should have the right to file an errors and omissions insurance claim against the debt collection company for false service that resulted in a verdict against me. I have already tried asking for an errors and omissions insurance policy from the debt collection company so that I could file a claim and the debt collection company simply ignored my request. I find this both egregious and outrageous.  "	1

Here, when we are talking about immigration, it should be first identified why a certain person left his country. Just like my friend before said to be a refugee is also a man, which probably feels bad in his own country. For example, when his country’s situation does not give him a life in dignity. So I think that every country should identify immigrants and help them in certain ways, for example with social benefits. I know that some countries for example Poland are not rich countries, so they need EU help in such a matter.  Especially the countries where immigration is quite high.	0
It is quite a problematic case. I think that the country plays an important role with helping immigrants. Let’s say that a concrete person would like to stay and live in a certain country, and then the government should ensure the normal development of such a family, especially the youngest members of this immigrant’s family. So at least one person of this family will have a higher education and no matter if he lived in Germany or Italy, he would have a better start and would integrate not only in the family’s country from which she escaped but also in the whole Europe. Here, the most important is education system and health care system and for that the country should give money.	0

As it was stated in this documentary, most of the illegal immigrants we have are actually legal immigrants whose visas have expired. So I think, if you limit that a little bit, that this group maybe gets for us in the discussion actually a little bit different facts, because they were already there and were integrated here, so they had their job here and because the job was good and because they wanted to stay but then were not able to get the visa extended; isn't there the possibility to make legal from illegal?	0
The problem is that cell phone customers have to pay for the minutes that are used. I have pre paid cell service and debt collectors are calling me all the time looking for someone else who I do not know. This is the problem. Harassment to the cell phone owner and harassment that the cell phone owner must pay for. this is why it will always remain illegal for debt collectors to call cell phones.  	1
They can't be sued on in court and communications should reflect that. I have found that persons who buy old debts are not competent and rely on software and letter services to fulfill their collection obligations. Perhaps it is time to return to licensing of collectors.  	1

"&gt; [rea·son]( &gt; 1. a basis or cause, as for some belief, action, fact, event, etc.: the reason for declaring war. &gt; 2. a statement presented in justification or explanation of a belief or action. &gt; 3. the mental powers concerned with forming conclusions, judgments, or inferences. &gt; 4. sound judgment; good sense. In definitions one and two if someone's belief in a religion causes them to do or believe in something they are doing it for a religious reason because their religion is the cause and used as justification. In definition three if they apply their religious system of belief to conclude, judge, or infer something, they are using religious reasoning. For definition four, if their are no logical inconsistencies between the person holding a view or doing something and their religious system of belief they are using religious reason. Faith in god may be a basic assumption of most religions but off of that assumption is a myriad of reasoning. And the basic assumption doesn't necessarily make it ""bad"" or illogical reasoning either, as all reasoning processes make basic assumptions."	0
Here's the thing: there *is* no correct answer. There's no way to determine the truth, because no such truth exists. It's all completely subjective, like aesthetics. Morality is a person's *opinion* of an action, and opinions are neither true nor false. Now, some opinions are easier to hold than others. Humans have a bunch of tropisms that make a pretty girl more pleasant to look at for most people than a crawling horror of infected facial tumours, for instance. A fresh juicy orange generally smells and tastes more appealing to most than dogshit, and being kind to those who are kind to you also comes more naturally to primates than beating the crap out of people for no particular reason. However, that doesn't mean that beauty exists anywhere but in the eye of the beholder, flavour-goodness anywhere but in their mouth, musical talent anywhere but in their ear, or act-goodness anywhere but in their mind. So, just because you can't prove that your opinions aren't 'more correct' than others, doesn't mean you can't act on them. As an extreme example, imagine someone starts playing a Nickelback album... Generally, if you start digging around in your personal ethics, you'll find that you can reduce most of your gut feelings to a handful of simple principles - and anything left over tends to be a special case that you should probably work on convincing yourself against, or refining your principles to include. And the fun part is, other people will generally agree to those principles, or to judgements derived from them (in which case, you can generally hound them a bit into affirming the principles after all). As such, when someone's acting in a way you find blatantly immoral, chances are the person can't even justify it to *themselves* - and in the meantime you have a duty to intervene. And if they manage to convince you that their way conforms to a more elegant and better-fit morality than your own - then you've learned something new :)	0

"I believe that a universal statute of limitations would be an effective way to end debt tolling. If there was a universal statute of limitations, there would be no need for debt tolling. Collectors would be able to file suit no matter where the debtor lived based on a single set of federal laws. It also makes things less confusing for debtors (they know that they can be sued within X amount of years no matter where they go, hence they can't ""run"" from debt and debt collectors don't have to go from state to state, wading through murky laws. Furthermore, debt collectors should not have the privilege of hiding behind tolling laws. Either they sue or they don't within a federally mandated set of time. Tolling simply keeps zombie debt going and going.  "	0
What I also feel is very important is that when we have these immigrants, we also have to integrate them and I always think this integration process then gives these problems, because the framework, the culture, everything that these people bring with them could be an enrichment for us, but it's then a big problem with the language, it's a big problem of the parental home, the support then also of the children accordingly, and I think if this integration could be worked on more intensively, then there would not be many problems and then we would also be with this togetherness.	0

The simplest way to understand this is to break the energy consumption of a car into two pieces: acceleration and cruise. When accelerating the weight of the car is extremely important to fuel economy. 1% more weight = 1% more energy required to accelerate. At cruise weight becomes almost negligible because the primary loss is from drag which is not effected by weight. From the very first gas-electric hybrid the key piece of technology was regenerative braking. Suddenly instead of throwing out all the energy that was spent accelerating the car each time you have to stop you recover it and store it in a battery for later use accelerating. For most hybrids the main fuel economy gain comes from stop and go driving. On the highway, hybrids and close to identical as possible gasoline powered cars are not all that different. So lets assume that a hybrid Prius is ~10% heavier than a conventional Prius. So Hybrid = 1360 kg, Conventional = 1230 kg. Accelerating to 100kph uses H = 525 kJ, C = 472.5 kJ. Assuming they have identical efficiencies they use the same amount of fuel. Now they brake and the conventional loses all that energy while the hybrid recovers 50% of it. Next time they accelerate the hybrid uses 262.5 kJ from the battery and 262.5 kJ from gasoline while the conventional uses 472.5 kJ from gasoline. So even without any power source other than gas, higher efficiency engines, better RPM mapping, or any technology other than regenerative braking, the hybrid comes out on top.	0
Probably late, but just to add, my organs are shit. I have complicated medical issues that have damaged my organs, muscles, and skin. I can't donate blood either, because it could kill the person. I HAVE to be able to opt out of organ donation, because my conditions are not things doctors would test a transplant organ for, normally. Unless I grow sick, have to stay in the hospital a while, and then die, the doctors wouldn't know, and they would kill someone with my organs. [Mainly with my blood] If I got in a car accident for example, and was pronounced dead at the scene, but the other person needed a kidney ASAP, what doctor wouldn't want to put my kidney in them? It LOOKS healthy. Opting out is my way of preventing people from dying.	1
I believe that this rubs people's hackles because the brain easily confuses fitness standards with military might. The problem is this is not the case. Fitness standards are a basic notion of overall fitness. It perhaps at one point was something similar to the idea of firefighters, that any one firefighter, if called upon, could pull any other firefighter out of a burning building. It stands to reason then, that you would want to make the basic standards for a firefighter to be able to lift and carry 250 pounds (the most likely weight a firefighter and his gear would weight.) But in todays ever changing military, it is simply not necessary, nor is it wise to operate under the idea that any soldier at any moment could and would need to take the place of another. Psychological operations, networking, drones, smart-war tactics require much more variety in ability. This level of functional differentiation requires different skillsets. In the same way that we acknowledge that the Air Force requires more technical knowhow, we see different standards for physical fitness in the Air Force as we see in the Marines, where brute physical skill is more often necessary. We also know that adding the diversity of ideas is one of the things that makes this country great, and our military is no exception. Similar to the idea that female police officers radically changed notions of interrogation with detectives and brought a fresh, nuanced perspective to the craft of detective work. So, for the same reason that you shouldn't be alarmed that a long distance runner would be a terrible strongman, so should you not be concerned about the fitness standards being different for men and women. The only thing that is important is that women remain physically fit within their ability level, so that their mind will be kept sharp (the point of fitness) and their body ready to react with purpose. Our military will always have plenty of strong men to do what strong men are called upon for, and having a diversity of skillsets and ideas that women will bring will only enhance our military might, not weaken it.	0
With a fully communicative voicemail identifying the purpose of the call I think one call is quite diligent. If they choose to call and leave no message then they might as well have done nothing. At least this way their message is being delivered.  	0
About a month after my husband left the military and before we even moved into a new place, a creditor called his parents and told them he was in the military with my husband and had papers that hadn't been signed so he had to get in touch with him. My mother-in-law knew we didn't have a phone yet, so because she thought it was something urgent she gave him our friends number. That collector called the friends number told the friend he was collecting a debt and my husband (not knowing what was told or how he got the number) let the collector know we had just moved and the payment was an oversight. Of course, the collector was trying very hard to get new address, phone, employer, etc but we did not have that yet. The bill was paid, yet they continued to call his parents and the friend after they had new contact info for him. Keep in mind, this was over a late $10 payment. I understand they are trying to collect a debt but doing so by false statements and telling others of the debt should never be allowed. Shouldn't they just be allowed to leave a name and contact number?  	1
My client needs to see a particular doctor. When she called his office she was informed that she needed to pay on her account of $278. She was not even aware that she had a balance there she had never received a bill from this office and when she asked when this bill was from, the gal told her 1986. They claim they never turned it over to a collection agency but the client filed bankruptcy in 2005. It is listed in her bankruptcy but the doctors office won't forgive the bill. If a debt owners want to collect on debts they need to send out bills so families know they have bills due, that only makes sense. My client is disputing the bill, but with no luck so far.  	1
Yes, I would cite two examples in France that come to mind: the Atlantic shipyard in Nantes, which was in the news. Two years ago, for illegal workers, who were employed illegally and housed in appalling conditions. So it's true that the product that is manufactured is luxury cruise ships. These are companies that make this [...] worse. So it's true that it raises the question of this type of practice. And then the other example I wanted to cite was in relation to Disney, which led a very important battle when they settled on Mane à Vallé. They wanted the employees who were employed in a Disney zone to be governed by American law and not by French law, which is very protective. So it's true that on the one hand there are the states, on the other hand there is the labor law that each state applies and then there is also the logic of the companies that by their economic power and then the jobs that propose or in any case that put in scales in the conditions of establishment on a given territory. There is a real balance of power today between the states, their international super-companies and the power of the workers, how they defend themselves, whether they are migrants or not. And it is true that it goes beyond this dimension of illegal work. Who is the one who does not respect the law? Is it the company today or is it the migrant?	1
"So two things, very briefly. First of all, we are all here together to talk about immigration. And it's a very important thing. But is the problem as big as everybody thinks it is? When you look at the numbers, actually, when you look at why Europe allows migration. I think that things complement each other very well. I think, because here, it is true, that sometimes there are a little bit of grating, those that can then pose problems in this or that dimension and here we do not have, but it is as soon as at the level of the numbers, in any case, we do not have a very important problem. It is certain incidents that suddenly make it a problem. I would like to mention the first point. The second point, and here I would like to react to what you said. In fact, as soon as we have taken the best out of these developing countries, the question is whether we should not also support the people in these countries. On the spot. I know that in the Netherlands they had [...] it's called ""circular"". And in fact it's about 200 people outside of Europe who took an internship in the Netherlands and gained work experience and so on, and then they went back to their country. Of course, it was just a drop in the ocean. But it was still a way for the people in those countries to be supported."	0
Frankly, I don't quite understand this notion - legal or illegal immigration. In Germany, for example, it is not possible to enter as a legal immigrant and then suddenly you become illegal. When you are an asylum seeker, you have to apply; they entered illegally, then they applied. Then the application is checked to see if they have really been persecuted. It is mainly a procedure that concerns political or racist persecution or other. So all this is foreseen, fixed by the legislator and it is very detailed. And if these people do not have the right, then they are simply expelled. So they have a certain legality during the asylum procedure, but if the control is negative, then they are expelled. So, what does this mean: these asylum seekers who have not been recognized as [?] right, should they still be given the possibility to stay anyway. When they couldn't prove that they were persecuted - that's what I don't understand.	1
That's exactly the point: no visa is issued at all - so once again we're moving within the EU - but it's a vacationer who is staying here, who is - nobody knows anything about this employment relationship, or nobody should, and it's downright illegal.	0
I have a question for Udo. The ethnic Germans from the former CIS countries, do they know the German language, or is the problem again lack of language, ignorance - actually it's one of those things; you can't communicate, lack of understanding makes you afraid and fear brings violence, in quotation marks. That is actually for me such a spiral, which arises somewhere again and again. Would it be possible for the EU to say - to come back to the EU level - this topic; a threshold is always to learn the national language in order to have understanding and to get along with each other.	0
I believe in equal-opportunity meritocracy, but I also think winners use their power to cheat and lock in advantages. The solution is to reset opportunity by seizing and redistributing wealth every 50 years so the winners have to keep proving themselves. CMV Cheating methods include: test prep, prep schools, legacy admissions, gifts to schools, inheritance, nepotism, racism. Let's put a stop to all this so we live up to the ideal of equal opportunity. I know how disruptive a 50 year reset would be, but I think if the winners really deserve their status they can handle it. They will naturally rise to the top after each reset and so much room will be made for disruptive innovation that any society that does this will soar ahead of those that don’t. Note that I don't want to dismantle firms, just redistribute ownership. I can imagine how hard this would be to implement, especially if it could not be done globally, but I think it’s a worthwhile goal because everyone needs to feel they live in a true meritocracy instead of a corrupt system. Maybe a constitutional convention would make it happen? Forms of wealth to redistribute continuously over time: education, food, health care, &amp; traditional public goods like water, roads, justice, etc. Forms of wealth to seize and redistribute every 50 years: money, land, valuable contracts, stocks, bonds, futures, derivatives, and other financial instruments. Forms of wealth that can’t be redistributed: innate intelligence, sociability, creativity, drive. These are the things winners should be judged on. It takes a little communism to keep capitalism working... unless I'm wrong.	0
I think that we should help countries in partnership with them and develop their ideals when we know that in Africa there should be one or two thematic universities on all the territories, it's a bit of a pity and a bit of a problem that these people don't have the means to develop their potential and that they are obliged to come to us. So I think that insofar as we can receive them, it's very good, but it seems to me that we must help them to develop in their own country and I think that notions of partnership, then it is true that in the [...] there are banana companies and that we do not know how the money is used, so we must also get involved in a monitoring and cetera that the money is used to create means for people to get out and mainly education, at the school and university level.	0
I will give you a concrete example. Every country perfectly knows from which different countries it has immigrants. We know why they are coming, we know all the reasons: economic or different ones. The conclusion is that we could give them some kind of quotas and then control them. We could control them without any prejudices or manipulations. Of course it would not solve all the problems but for sure somehow it will help people to come legally to different countries (because the control has been already made).	0
I think, finally, I come from a region where there are not many immigrants, so I am perhaps not in a good position to speak, but I think that immigration poses problems, in Europe and elsewhere, it is not the immigrants who work, I think that it is rather the immigrants who do not work. I think that if all immigrants worked, we wouldn't have such a problem. I have the impression from afar that family reunification, company, that's a lot of people and I'm not making any judgement on that, but the fact that when you see all the Afghan and Pakistani illegal immigrants who want to come to Great Britain, they want to go to work. It seems clear. And they are prevented from crossing when they want to work. And there are many of them who are here, but I am not sure that they really want to work. So, this question is also taboo, because if we say that we are anti-immigrants, then, I believe that the question is not the same, but there is an immigration for work and an immigration even if the adaptation was difficult, also that at the level of social protection, a coverage that is not [...]. I think that attracts them too.	0
"E-Oscar was created by the credit reporting agencies due to a requirement that is outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This process is fully electronic save for the consumer's ability to upload paper correspondence or documents for the debt collector/creditor to review. Additionally, the CFPB has published clarification as to the requirements surrounding a ""reasonable investigation"" when a dispute is issued, requiring debt collectors/creditors to go one step further. The underlying issue is this system is abused by many individuals who mass submit disputes repeatedly that have no validity. Agencies and creditors are forced to sift through all of those frivolous disputes in order to actually address legitimate disputes.  "	0
[03: 09] It seems to me, that a very good solution would be encouraging, not in another way. A good solution would be to change various legal procedures in order to facilitate legal immigration so that the immigrants would resign from what is illegal in favour of the legal one. As it is known, if they have a status of illegal immigrant, they will have more rights, greater guardianship and state care, and it seems to me that a good idea is included in the documents we have received, that we should head this direction, I suppose. Thank you. 	0
It's actually like Björn said, we have the Spanish, we have the Italians, we can't let them do it and solve everything themselves so they're the ones who are facing many problems, so the island of Lampedusa for example or other areas so in Spain, in the south of Spain and so I think there are also negotiations that are going on, that is other countries also have to give more active assistance to make sure that these external borders of the Union are better protected. At the same time, inside, we should do more, perhaps by discussing more to see what we could do to allow this integration after 60 years, and so we have the Algerians, second and third generation, the Turks, second and third generation, so that they become real French and Germans, because there are obviously many associations that are busy and so on, that want to open up these cultures and so change mentalities, but I believe that we must also have a positive attitude, and so they always remain among themselves and so on - no, sorry! If we open up, if we also open up more and more, why wouldn't we be able to mix - I don't mean to merge the two cultures, no - but to have a better understanding and a 100 percent tolerance without having constant frictions and hatred between two, three groups. Obviously this starts at the level of the individual but at the same time, the European Union can and should still do a lot at this level as well.	0
A question that I'd ask surrounds dialects. There are numerous dialects for Spanish, French, etc. and it would be very expensive for agencies to translate every letter into every dialect of a certain language, Spanish being the most common for this type of occurrence. I'd greatly appreciate feedback, commentary and also recommendations on everyone's view on how to address differing language formalities.  	0
I still vividly remember receiving automated calls every Saturday morning in college insisting that I settle a debt under someone else's name. It was a case of mistaken identity, and eventually I sorted it out by tracking down the collection agency and calling them during business hours. This was a tremendous inconvenience, however. I strongly support limitations on robocalls, on total call volumes, and ask that you consider creating a complaint process for harassing or mistargeted calls. Collection agencies should face financial sanctions for misbehavior, payable to the target of their abuse.  	1
I would like to note that everything depends on what kind of illegal immigration it is. For example: if these are refugees of war, I would be more for keeping them in my country, for example in a refugee camp, and not to send them back to the countries from where they escaped and where they certainly await death. A bit different we could treat the immigrants who came just for economic reasons, commercial reasons, but here as well I think that everything depends on the individual situation and we should take into account various factors, for example: What will happen to certain persons after extradition to its own country? Does this person have a place to come back or not? Was this threat already there before he moved?	0
Failure to properly validate the debt as described by furnishing final billing statement and original application would invoke the consumer's rights to have all further collection activity immediately barred and the ability of the consumer to have the debt IMMEDIATELY removed from their credit report. All too often it takes years to have false or misleading information removed from a consumer's credit report.  	0
There are still too often abuses by debt collectors in regard to time-barred debts. Zombie debt collectors who use partial payments, acknowledgement of the debt in writing, or other tactics are effectively hard-wiring around the laws having to do with the statute of limitations. I have witnessed situations where consumers were effectively tricked into setting up a series of payments on a long time-barred debt. Collectors continue to take advantage of consumers for whom ESL and also those who are unsophisticated and possibly naive.  	1
Don't you think that having autonomy is not very compatible with the notion of having freedom of movement on European soil? And from the moment when we want to have this freedom, we can hardly be autonomous, not taking into account, in fact, the problem in a whole Europe. [1 :	0
The question to the expert I would ask: How would you imagine that these immigrants who are illegally employed some by [?] children, how would you legalize them? All of a sudden. So, first question: If the children of illegal immigrants can go to school if the parents don't have the papers, if they don't have what's required - how is it possible for their children to go to school? Second question: If they are legalized, then the employer will not employ them anymore, because these people will have to respect the minimum working conditions and the collective agreements and then it will not be profitable for the employer to employ them. And then these are people who are there legally, so they can have access to all the social security benefits, unemployment benefits, etc. when, logically, these people lose their jobs. That can't be right. So I repeat, I'm not against it, but I don't quite understand how it can be put into practice.	0
When calling about a debt, debt collectors MUST verify that they are speaking to the debtor(s) or other adult within the household. I know that is stated within the FDCPA but from experience I know it doesn't always happen. My situation goes back to the 1970's but it was done then and it's probably still being done today. Calling repeatedly, threatening, screaming, cursing at children gets collectors absolutely nowhere. It is a most disgusting form of abuse that should never be tolerated. New language in the FDCPA should specifically and clearly state this. Additionally, there should be some form of penalty for collectors who engage in this demeaning and useless practice.  	1
"&gt; BUILDING 7 What exactly was the benefit of these unknown insiders destroying building 7? It accomplished nothing compared to the Twin Towers and Pentagon in terms of boosting public support for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the only other theory I can think of was that there was some sensitive data stored there. In which case, wouldn't these ""insiders"" have a much easier job sneaking in and destroying the data rather than destroying the entire building? &gt;The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed The buildings fell at free fall speed because they were being piledriven by all the building on top of it. Think about how much weight was at and above where the two planes hit. How many tons of metal, concrete, etc. came down the minute the collapse started? That much weight is pretty much unstoppable. &gt;implying a coordinated severance of support beams... Have you seen the amount of wiring and explosives that normal demolitions companies use to destroy a building? How much time it takes to set that stuff up? How much more time it would take to set it all up but have it all be perfectly hidden? How could these ""insiders"" sneak into the building undetected by security personnel and janitorial staff and do all of this work? Work by the way that was **impossibly durable** because it all survived the impact of a jetliner and the subsequent fire. How do you design a demolition project (which is by it's very nature, prone to explosion) to withstand the impact of a plane and a massive fire? &gt;with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns. A 45 degree angle cut only really makes sense on a vertical support, so how did they attach thermite to a vertical support? Even nano-thermite takes considerable time to burn through a support that thick, so whatever you're using to attach the thermite is just going to burn and fall off long before the I-beam is cut through. &gt;Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns. I suspect this was probably the result of debris falling down an elevator shaft or something similar, but I've got a more important point: What would these noises mean? The buildings toppled from the top down and once the collapse started, Atlas himself couldn't hold that shit up. &gt;Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene. A building falling with such force pulverized almost everything in it's path, including rusty stuff and stuff made out of aluminum. Here's the kicker though: **how could they have possibly gotten away with it?** Breaking the story would make you a national hero and celebrity, so how much money would it take to buy you off? Now take that amount and multiply it by the number of people that had to be accomplices. Dozens of demolitions *experts* (and I mean they have to have a demolition superpower to pull off this job), Security and Janitorial staff that took a bribe to effectively let their friends/coworkers die, guys willing to kill themselves for the job. Add onto that all the people that found out working on the official report of what happened and every guy at Popular Mechanic that learned the dark truth. And every single one of them took the bribe? Not only did they take the bribe, but none of them have come out about it yet? The NSA couldn't even get away with it's spying operation when it wasn't hurting anybody and had noble intentions (wrong and an invasion of privacy, but still...noble intentions); but you think that a group could get away with murdering 5,000 civilians? The first person to come out would be a celebrity and a hero. He'd be on talk shows, have book and movie deals, and get his name written in history. But not a single person is willing to do that? To propose that 9/11 was an inside job raises so many questions, and I can practically guaranty any answers you give are just going to raise even more questions."	0
"I just see it as part of your hairstyle. It's just part of the hair that grows on your head, man. Growing a beard (or rather, not shaving it off) is no less weird than deciding how long, or what style you like the rest of your hair. I guess there is also a lot to be said about how our culture has decided that shaving is the standard, and therefor, when you stop shaving you have suddenly ""started growing"" a beard, as if you weren't already doing that, but I'm not articulate or smart enough to really dig into that. Does the reason you dislike beards have something to do with seeing them as somehow *different* than other hair? Overall, I don't think it is really about people *liking* or *disliking* beards. I think it's more that they just don't mind them."	0
It would be a good idea to create a national database of collectors and assign them an ID number just like the IRS. Require them to state their name and ID number just like IRS employees do. This would allow debtors to easily identify an abusive collector or just call a debt collection agency and ask to speak to a specific employee. If they call and leave a voicemail they are required to state their ID number somewhere in the recording. It would be good for both debtors and collectors.  	0
I should actually stand by Günther a bit. His example with the apartment is exemplary - you have to see it that way. If he invites a visitor and they stay for an excessive amount of time, if he says so, the thing is over, now you have to go home and they stay - what does he do then? The same is what we say, he has his job, he was visiting, he did something, and then the visa expired, so then the party is over, why didn't he follow up the visa? I don't know the reasons, maybe someone can help me there, yes. Why he doesn't renew the visas. But basically, as an example, he is right. Who is overcharging, claiming my home, then I would have to take some measures - and if I invite him again, one of the three.	0
I'm not sure a registration system for debt collectors really addresses the issue. I'm not exactly sure how the registration system would operate. In MA, consumers can check online to see whether a debt collector is licensed to practice in the state, many just don't know about the website or on a more basic level don't know that the debt collector has no right to try to collect from them. Is the registration system meant to displace state laws requiring licensing of debt collectors in the individual states? I hope that's not the case since states have a strong interest in regulating debt collectors for the protection of its consumers.  	0
"I do not believe that use of social media should be allowed to initiate or to conduct any legal or other sensitive arrangements or communications to and from debt collectors. There are a couple of things that I've noticed about social media: social media is a fad, and an outlet. People use social media as an outlet for the narcissistic/public/storybook/memorable moments side of their lives. And recent evidence shows that fewer teens and young adults are using facebook and twitter. And I am most certain that no social media user would like for their private life to become public life by dealing with a debt collector on facebook. Nobody likes to be in debt and have bill collectors chasing them, In writing"" to me, means a letter delivered in the mail. I would also accept an interpretation to mean delivered by email but only on official company letterhead documents. And only if first requested by the debtor and not first initiated by the collector. But I can not accept ""in writing"" to mean messages and communication sent via social media. I think that E-Sign consent should only be valid for the original creditor. And any and every collector who then gets involved must get the debtor to consent E-Sign with them. The reason is because there are some things that I, as a consumer, am comfortable with dealing online or through email with my original creditors, but there are things that I know I would not feel comfortable dealing with online/email with a debt collector. So E-Sign should not be blanket consent for anyone and everyone.  "	1
The state, county, city make their own laws. That is what I have ran into and if a person does not hire a lawyer, are not a big group, there isn't much hope for the consumer. The law where everyone may hire a lawyer has limits--IE: Will not take a criminal or money cases if a non profit org. or free lawyer takes the case. I darn sure do not understand the laws etc. and I have tried to read about all this for 2 years. Of course I'm old and 100% DAV, that could be it.  	1
So, my address in Salzburg, I would like to give it to you, because for me, no problem. You can ring my doorbell, in my street. It's very cute, it's almost a bit kitschy and we have Italians, we have Spaniards, we have people from Kongo, we have several people from Nigeria and it's no problem for us. We are just normal people from Salzburg, not particularly nice or nasty. We are quite normal, ordinary people and we see this as an enrichment of our respective cultures, because we talk, we exchange and what bothers us is the [...] both for the Austrian and non-Austrian neighbors, we tell ourselves. We call it communication and this will certainly prevent, also problems in the future. And I am not at all afraid to ring the doorbell when I see an Islamic name. There are many Turks in Salzburg and I am not at all afraid of Turks, of Turkish citizens, and I think that creating these anxieties, these fears, is not at all correct, neither from the political point of view, nor from the human point of view.

"Your reasoning is faulty because the food industry is just as profit driven as any other industry that means that they will produce whatever we as consumers will buy. If we eat less meat and more vegitarian then eventually the demand for vegitarian alternatives will cause the food industry to focus more on vegitarian food and less on industrialised meat production. And eventhough the restaurant you go to won't stop buying meat because your friend ordered a sallad it will change it's menu if they see a change in what people order and if enough restaurants change their menus then the food industry will change their production. No one person can change the world all we can do is change ourselves and hope that others follow. Where I come from things are already changing we have more vegitarian restaurants now than we had 10 years ago, we have an active debate about meat consumption, schools introduced vegitarian options and now some public schools are introducing meat free mondays. I try to think like this: If you refuse to change why should anyone else? Or as someone more eloquent than me once put it: &gt;""You must be the change you want to see in the world"""	1
while this isn't the best forum for me to go into my company's entire collection process, we work a debt for at least 120 days with letters, live agent calls, robo calls, emails, mailed invoices, and by suspending subscription service (where allowed) as part of our collection campaign. Even then, we only go to litigation after the debtor has been unresponsive to our attempts to contact them. I've found that if a debtor talks to their creditors, many times creditors will take their situation into account. I've offered lengthy repayment plans, reduced or waived interest or late fees, or partial settlement for those explain their hardship. But if a debtor is uncooperative or doesn't respond to our attempts to work out a balance, what other alternatives do creditors have?  	1
I don't think we can say that the policy concerning illegal immigration should be the domain of the country or of the European Union. These are two different levels that have to deal with different problems. I don't know what happens in other countries, but it must be the same in France, for example, when the law stipulates that in cities, traffic must be at 50 km per hour, the mayor of the city can say, in which part of the city I am going to demand that instead of 50 km it should be 30 km. So it's more restrictive. But he can't say that the law foresees 50 km per hour, and say, but in my city, I don't care, I want to allow 70 km anyway. Well, in the European Union, in my opinion, it is the same thing. There must be a certain number of common bases for all countries concerning illegal immigration - a common base. But afterwards, each country can, in my opinion, harden its position. It is obvious that countries like Spain, Italy, France, which have by tradition or by geographical context, much more immigrants than the countries of Eastern Europe. Well, they don't have the same problems. So there must be a common base and then each country must do what it wants. Terrien? principle of law, which provides well that, a government of a country can authorize or refuse the entry of a foreigner on its country.	1
I believe that no vaccine should be given to any child under one year of age, especially a newborn. CMV They never used to give vaccines to babies or pregnant women. I do not think that they cause autism, but at the same time, I see no valid reason to give a crap load of chemicals to a child who's immune system has not developed. I think at birth vaccinations are more harmful than the pharmaceutical industry lets on (i.e. mental illness rates have soared among children). Mercury is toxic. You shouldn't even eat tuna while you're pregnant. I'm not against vaccination, I'm a nursing student, it's a wonderful thing. I just don't think that we should administer anything that may derail a childs development at that early of an age. Vaccines should be administered after one year of age, at least.	0
I think Hartmut's approach, is the right one. So zero immigration - what do we think? Maybe we should start thinking about our own situation, what is the situation in the country that we represent here and then maybe even have a show of hands, obviously it's not a requirement, if you don't want to it's okay. Just to see what the mood is in this room, is zero immigration a real solution for you?	0
I have dealt with the issue of disputes and when you file a dispute and it as been closed it is placed in the comment section that you have filed a dispute. By doing this, this has kept me from refinancing my home just because the word dispute was there. The mortgage company said I had to have this removed, so I filed another form to ask for this to be removed it never was. I believe that once the dispute has been closed there should be no indication that there was a dispute filed. You again get penalized for trying to correct mistakes on your report. Another issue that has come up regarding when an account has been charged off or in my case a repossession of a vehicle I had turn over due to not being released by my doctor to go back to work and my disability ran out , I had no other choice but to hand the vehicle over. then 6 years later I received a 1099 for over $6000.00. Plus the 16% interest they charged me for 4 years. We keep paying these high interest rates but yet we still have to pay for our credit scores and only receive one free report a year, If we are trying to stay on top of credit fraud and inaccurate information that is not of our doing but from reporting agencies , these agencies should be putting more funds in for these things.  	1
After a court verdict in favor of a debt collector, Banks assess a significant fee against a customer when a customer's account is levied by the debt collector , even if there are scant funds in the account on the day the levy is imposed. Explain how assessing a 125 dollar bank levy fee when an account has 50 dollars in it helps resolve the ongoing debt resolution. The Debt collector gets nothing and the customer is hit with a 125 dollar bank levy fee. Why isn't there a 100 dollar float that is impervious to a bank levy fee and protected from the debt collector's clutches as well? Once again, we get back to the same underpinning, Judges who simply decide on whether a default has occurred without caring why the default occurred are basically rubber stamping minions of a system corrupted by a lack of fairness. People can lose income based on circumstances beyond their control, yet the system doesn't even blanche an eye. A debtor who purposely runs up debt quickly and defaults is treated identically to someone who had a perfect payment history but had to stop working to become a CareGiver for a family member. A debtor who purposely runs up debt quickly and hires a lawyer can strategically default and possibly get a better resolution than an honest person with an impeccable payment history who has lost income because of an event beyond their control.  	0
"A lot of excellent points made by MLegz13. My elderly parents needed help with day to day activities even if they were too proud to say anything. I stopped my award winning video business to be their CareGiver. Once the savings ran out, I had to default after 15 years of having a perfect credit card payment history. The debt collectors were constantly accusing me of being a ""refuse to pay"" even though I said I acknowledge the debt but had no income at the moment. It is this type of scenario that requires debts be frozen where they were at the time of default and in exchange the debtor agrees to pay off the debt, even if the initial monthly payments are just for a couple of dollars. What this does is free the debtor's phone lines so they can completely focus on moving forward rather than engage in pointless rat a tat with repetitive debt collection callers. It's why I started the Debt Neutrality Petition as well. If you click on the link PLEASE read the comments left by some of the 500 plus people who have signed the petition. Even a debt collector signed the petition, their comment speaks volumes of truth, as did all the others as well. Debt Neutrality Petition. __URL__"	1
"First of all, the notion of a ""two party system"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If 80% of the popular vote in every state had gone to Jill Stein, she would have become president, unless for some grand unprecedented fixing at the Congressional level (which admittedly could probably happen). Secondly, how do you even know that McCain and Romney would really be as bad as you feared? Everyone *thought* Obama was going to close Guantanamo Bay. Everyone *thought* he was going to pull back the executive powers Bush gave himself. Everyone *thought* he might end the drug war, or at least end the wars overseas. He's been a lot less progressive than we thought, so why do we assume that McCain and Romney would have been just as conservative as we thought? They likely would have been much more moderate as well, if they were actually elected. Thirdly, why does it matter if Romney and McCain would have been worse? If the school cafeteria serves (A) moldy pizza and (B) cold gruel, does that mean the students who eat the gruel don't get to complain about it? We hardly had a say in who the party nominees were, and we're having to live with the cards they dealt us, so why shouldn't we complain? What about people who didn't vote, or voted for a leftist third party? Also, specifically to Reddit, which you mentioned: Reddit was *all about Obama* during the election. Basically every time he came on TV, the front page had 10 posts along the lines of: * Does anyone else have tears in his eyes? Obama clinched his re-election with that speech. * Redditors, how can anyone at this point still support Mitt Romney? * Regardless of your politics, I think we can all agree the Obama family is the cutest first family of all time * Wow. Just wow. Obama just destroyed Romney in that debate. All the while, turning a blind ear to any suggestion that he might not be the Great Progressive Hope of the Universe. So I'm sure a lot of the moaning on Reddit is blowback from that."	0
There's no need to be rude about it. There are some debt collection practices that should obviously be illegal. Other things that people are discussing here are obviously matters of convenience. To the extent that preferences are widely shared and outright prohibition wouldn't increase lending costs across the board beyond a marginal amount, outright prohibition makes sense. But if someone wants the ability to stop someone from conducting any and all robocalls from all phones, and robocalls help creditors recoup their loans, then the creditor should be able to charge a regulated fee for that convenience. I'm not saying that the debt collection agency itself would charge the fee Just that a consent-based approach is another option.  	0
"It bothers me a little that the subject of immigration is reduced to religious choice, as if the fact of having such or such a religion implies that one has a certain culture at all times in one's life. I would like to say in this regard that when we look at the second half of the 19th century in France, how in Anger for example, in the West of France, we spoke of Bretons who were also French, and also Christians, we spoke of them in exactly the same terms as we use today for immigrants coming from Black Africa or North Africa for France in any case, exactly in the same terms. So, it bothers me that this is reduced to, how can I put it, a tree that hides a forest. That's it. So what bothers us about the arrival of these people? What is it that bothers us? And here I'm just talking about the word ""immigration"", afterwards, there is also the word ""illegal"". That would perhaps have to be known at another time . But what is it that bothers us?"	1
I too have received calls from collectors who are on fishing expeditions, looking for a person who owes money. THE PROBLEM IS, EVEN AFTER BEING INFORMED THAT THE PERSON THEY ARE LOOKING FOR CANNOT BE REACHED AT MY PHONE NUMER AND TO PUT ME ON THEIR DO NOT CALL LIST - THEY STILL CALL. I have contacted local law enforcement, state attorney general and federal levels and been informed that if I owed money, I can have the debt collector contact me in writing only, but if I don't owe money, I have no protection because the debt collector has a right to do business. Unless the debt collector has more than a last name that matches the person's who owes the debt, they should be allowed to attempt to contact that phone number ONLY until they are told that that person cannot be reached at that phone number. They should need to have more than a last name for any further phone calls. They should also have to tell the person they insist on calling why they believe they can find the person who owes the money there. Additionally, they should also be required to inform the consumer of how to file a complaint if the calls continue. There should be a penalty for harassing people who don't owe money. When you don't owe money, getting phone calls early in the morning or late at night twice a week is harassment the more abusive ones robo call several times a day and hang up when an answering machine picks up). Additionally, the means of protecting yourself from harassment should not require any financial burden to the consumer. I was told I could file a lawsuit in the case of one extremely abusive collector  	1
"[CMV] I believe the reality around me does not exist, and there is no way to prove it does I'm convinced that it's not possible to rely on the world around me to be real and that there is no way to prove it to me. An extension of that is that I feel like there is no way to actually know anything whatsoever. From math to physics and chemistry, every science has holes in it and they depend on big assumptions about reality that cannot ever doubted, otherwise the whole system falls over. For example, mathematics, being one of the most fundamental basis of our perception of the world, depends on axioms and postulates that boil down to ""Been tested a ton of times, makes sense in our heads"" for even the simplest statements of x=x. Or that 1+1 = 2 because we've never encountered a situation where this was not true. Anything as fundamental as that, and just the whole knowledge of human biology where the brain depends on outside input to judge its environment and ""prove"" reality to itself seems utterly flawed. Think about it. I don't know if what I see in front of me is actually there. I don't know if the people I talk to are real. How can they even prove it to me?

It's actually beneficial: This is how minority interests get things done. Ignoring the practical problems that arise when we start creating arbitrary issue boundaries, a system where every issue is segmented would be a system dominated by majority interests and also a system where negotiating is severely limited. For instance, suppose a few states live in a particularly dry region of the country. These states might have a minority interest in, say, fresh water delivery systems. Suppose they need to build a new one. Answer this for yourself: Why would the majority fund a project like this? 1. Because they are generous? 2. Because it's the right thing to do? 3. Because they can get something in exchange? By allowing 'unrelated' issues into bills, we give this minority interest leverage at the negotiating table. They can effectively say: we can't support your bill unless we get traction on our issue as well. In addition, by giving them a stake at the table, we can make our bill, which may otherwise be irrelevant to the minority, something worth taking action on. Now this does NOT mean dry-state representatives can SAFELY vote NO on a bill when they don't get traction on their issue. A vote is a constantly evolving negotiation, where the public perception, public desire, majority interest, and minority interest are constantly balancing. Allowing bills to be open documents maximizes the issues that get weighed into this calculation. I think this is a good thing - even though is may be frustrating when your issue is blocked by some other interest. **tldnr;** unrelated topics increase the leverage of minority interests and makes the original bill appealing to more counter parties.	0
Calling a debtor at work is counter-intuitive; if collectors are continuously calling someone at work, other employees may report it to the debtor's supervisor. Most companies have established rules about receiving or making personal calls from company or cell phones during an employee's working hours. If a collector or creditor calls a debtor on his/her cell phone and is informed that the debtor is at work, the call should be terminated. No calls to employers should be allowed as this jeopardizes the debtor's job. How does that help in debt collection? It doesn't.  	0
I think it is frightening that immigration is measured by a criterion such as education or professional qualification. There should be a principle. So we have, for example, in the documentation the points system when there is a need in a certain sector for skilled labor. So maybe we will let them in, but as a matter of principle, we don't give this opportunity to people who don't have qualifications. I find this a bit difficult because it would mean that we would simply be ranking immigrants. And one has the impression that disadvantaged people who live badly in their country of origin are not wanted in our country either.	0
It is true that on the local level, there should be provided an immigration policy. I agree with that. I agree with the Sir who said that immigration policy should be carried out on the national level. However, I think that we, I mean the EU, should create some kind of frames. Then, the EU member states will make more concrete decisions.  	0
Yes, I think that in most countries - it would be stupid not to admit that, that we need a certain number of immigrants. As Jesus put it, there are types of work that we don't want to do and we let others do it. And at some point, the entrepreneur takes advantage of these people, somehow, somewhere. In all countries, we should ask ourselves what has happened historically in our country. There was a time when the doors were open to all people who came from Latin America. Everyone was allowed to come and there was no question about where they came from, what they could do, it didn't matter, everyone was welcome. And there you should already know like Ana said or Carlos or Jürgen, that people should integrate themselves culturally. A week and a half ago there was an article in Periodico where they said that children born in Spain, 13, 14, 15 years old, don't feel Spanish. They feel like they're Ecuadorian, Colombian, or whatever, which they don't even know, but whatever, and then they beg or they steal and then you find yourself in a situation where someone is robbing you and you can't send them back; he's from your own country. And then what do you do? He stays there, once and for all. And that means that except for legislation - the laws are made by the smart, or for the smart, depending.	1
I would like to respond so, Gudrun actually, I also see this problem of language and so in my opinion language is one of the factors. And it doesn't even have to be German, because they come to the European Union, so it would be better to find a solution - I don't know - French, English that they learn at least one language let's say common and so if there is this availability, then it doesn't pose any problems in my opinion.	0
"Ok, I'm a high school debate student and the topic you brought up is one that is often debated. I'm a liberal, more than most, but economically I don't think we need more socialism in general if out goal is economic prosperity. I agree with your points on heath care and basic utilitys (internet i hope) but I really do disagree with you on higher education. Before I go into the meat of my argument I want to establish what parts or forms of socialism are effective and what parts are ineffective. The two sides of the scale are capitalism and communism(duh), and socialism is somewhere in the middle. I argue that socialism does not have anything unique about it, to be effective is must use some capitalist policies and some communist policies. If you try and split the difference you end up getting neither. The examples in the US are Medicare and Medicaid, Section 8, and more recently social security. These are all government run programs that use a mix of Public and private funding and today are a drain on the gov. and increasingly less effective. You can have a socialist society where one sector, say heath care is under total government control(to provide it to everyone) or under all private control(to increase tech and keep prices low) than both will achieve there goals. By extension this means that when you a a partially subsided or half government controlled sector then you end up with a mess, high prices low tech innovation. (this referrers to government capital not regulation.) Higher education should not be standardized or payed for by the government. 1. Today higher education is overemphasized and is not catered to those who would benefit from having it. 2. Only 30% ish of the people have the mental capacity to benefit for college ( Dorrel, 11). This means that you would have to have the US government either supporting or carrying out tests that say, ""You're in, and You're not"" or they would just let everyone in. The former is unconstitutional and the latter is not realistic or cost effective. 3. You have have no mix or government money without impacts that outweigh the benefits. Government money in a private sector will drive prices up, so while the Gov. intentions were good the have actually created a bubble that will burst very soon. 4. Government funding is ok but it would need to be done through a subsidy contingent upon low prices not loans. 5. Government run colleges will halt scientific research as we know it. Now, despite student loans, there is stem cell, cancer, biochemical and other kinds of research going on. If the government took over the schools any tech advancement could be grabbed, halted, weaponized kept away from the public. This possibility halts advancement in general and would hurt humanity as a whole. 6. Finally, the fiscal argument. Colleges cost alot, and they won't make money in the form you are suggesting. Simply put, we don't have the money and that is a reality everyone has to face regardless of philosophy. Any retorts , kritits or comment i please leave them"	1
"I think that the EU cannot live without immigration. With more immigration or with less immigration - it lives with immigration. This is fundamental. And then with immigration from Africa, people, they come to another country, to another society. And they don't want to give up or give up their culture, their polygamy, their bigamy. That's it. And the example of the maternity hospital, is an example. People, they arrived in a country like France. France has a culture. In fact, the woman cannot be touched by a man during her delivery, so you have to choose another country. You have to submit yourself finally, you have to respect the culture, the practices of a country like France. And crazy ? It is our culture. But we are good in some areas, we are bad in others. But that's how it is. But we can only move forward by respecting others. And those who want to come, they have to think: ""I'm going to respect the people I had known when I'm in my destination country""."	0
In fact, that's a big problem. The countries of the EU need to cut military spending and put the money aside for the welfare state, for pensions, and for European civilization, European civilization, which is very human and humane. We don't need military, we don't need weapons, that's one way to address the problem.	0
I wanted to say that when we talked about unemployment earlier, it is now also being investigated in Spain, for example, what happens to Romanians who have become unemployed in Spain and receive unemployment benefits, that they are not at all willing to return to Romania, Mr. [Rolf] on the other side of the table is right. We can't always start from our own personal experiences, we have to look at this problem from the point of view of society as a whole. We talk about economic aspects and integration, but it's also about security. That is a big problem. There are organized gangs of immigrants, I don't know if they are legal or illegal immigrants, but there is also a big problem with crime, with security. I don't know how to solve that. They have a right to work, of course; if there is work.	1
With regard to this point of view, I would like to give my opinion. What is the use of a qualification, what is the use of training if the diplomas are not recognized? I have experienced this myself many times in my professional activity that we have people, for example, who have a university or college degree from Russia, who already have work experience in highly qualified professions. But in diplomas, qualifications are not recognized. This is the problem. And then we say we have doctors, we have a lot of people who come to us to work and quite qualified. So when we talk about the emigration of German doctors, all of a sudden we ask these doctors - some years ago, fifteen years ago, it was impossible, it was very very difficult for example to realize a transition year and to adapt to the medical system in Germany. Today it is different, the possibility exists. But in other professions, it is really extremely difficult to have a diploma recognized. And I don't think this is the right solution.	1
Yes, in France, there has always been immigration. In the 20th century, there were in particular the Polish for a certain period of time, a little later the Italians, the Portuguese and the Spanish, before the Second World War. This did not pose any problems, in the sense that people came to France to work, not necessarily to die, at the end of their normal life. They came to work because there was more work in France at that time than in their country of origin. But they tried to assimilate, to integrate into the host country. And it was relatively easy because the cultures were relatively close. And from all that we have heard since the beginning, people are not opposed to immigration, but we feel that the problem that arises, even if the word has not been pronounced, is that many immigrants are of Muslim faith and that precisely, that makes a very different culture. So, it's true, it's a problem, we mustn't hide   [...] our faces. Most immigrants try to live like they do in their country of origin, others do not. But there is indeed a problem that many people feel every day and this problem, in fact, makes them against immigration in that sense. That's the first point. Second point, it is true that by accepting immigrants in the European Union, we somehow impoverish the countries of origin. And for that we can't do anything, it's not us who go and get them, it's them who come of their own free will and I don't see how to do it differently. But it is certain and even last night, I saw on French television a program about French doctors who had operated on children in Togo and the Togolese doctor said that there are more Togolese doctors from the Paris region than Togolese doctors in Togo themselves. But that is not our fault. It is a choice they make and I do not see how we can oppose it.	1
How about allowing arbitrators to not be bound entirely by the law, but also by common sense when it comes credit card defaults? Common sense tells us that if a Colorado flood washes away a community, those in the community are possibly not going to be able to pay their credit card bills for a few months. Common sense tells us that a medical emergency, being the victim of a hit and run accident, destruction of a home, or becoming an unpaid CareGiver for a family member should take precedence over the monthly payment requirement. This is not about debt forgiveness, its about declaring a debt neutral, no more penalties, fees or interest rate charges are applied to the debt, and the debtor agrees to pay off the debt in a reasonable manner, even if it takes 10 years to do so.   	0
"I don't believe that, regarding sexual preference, we're necessarily born that way. CMV Let me first state that I don't believe that sexual preference is a choice, or that it can be changed through therapy (the evidence definitely seems to be against it). When people say they they were ""born that way,"" maybe what they really mean is simply that they didn't have a choice in the matter. In that sense, I agree. However, AFAIK, there isn't enough hard scientific evidence to support the theory that people are born straight/gay/bi/asexual/etc. I think the possibility exists, but we can't at this point in time, say that for sure. I think another possibility is that while genetic factors, and hormonal influence may play a part, environmental (physical, emotional, social, etc.) factors after birth may also play a part in forming a person's sexuality. Am I wrong? CMV."	1
Is it possible to just allow consumers to opt out of certain kinds of communication entirely? They could set transparent, limited rate increases which debt collectors could charge for each mode of communication that is eliminated. A rule setting that kind of rate increase would add some necessary transparency to the question of whether these kinds of communications are even worthwhile for the agency.	0
There is a Chinese saying that you should never give the fish to the person to eat. No, you have to give him the fishing rod and make him learn to fish. That's it. That's it. And then I think what we need to do is for those who want to come and want to have a better standard of living. They don't have the opportunity to do that in their own country. That's fine. That's why I told you earlier that in some countries there is so much wealth, in Africa, for example. And this wealth is not distributed. Often people abandon these countries because the wealth they have is not distributed to all. And so they have to think of other options. I think the main problem is this. Europe is getting older. That is a fact. But we must not let the young people die like that. They are the problem.	1
I think that in general, the drone strikes are problematic in a veritable cornucopia of different ways, but here's my take on al-Awlaki. He was both a U.S. citizen a senior member of al-Qaeda, and so it's fairly difficult to argue that he wasn't committing treason, right? So in a perfect world, he'd deserve a trial for that treason, the result of which almost certainly would've been conviction and execution. But he'd been out of the country and on the run for years, AND he was still actively participating in and abetting the operations of al-Qaeda right up until his death. So what if a trial for al-Awlaki was never realistically going to be a possibility? What if there was never going to be a feasible opportunity to capture him or conduct a raid on him a la bin Laden? It's not like he was a random high-value terrorist who regularly made visits to the U.S. where he could be easily captured. If he was revealed to be checking out a falafel restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Obama administration chose to drone strike him into oblivion when they could have easily apprehended him instead, that would be a regrettable decision. I think al-Awlaki raises an interesting question: what do you do about an American citizen who is actively committing treason against the country, but is doing so while on the run and who may be difficult or impossible to capture? Do you allow him to continue coordinating terrorist attacks against you because you can't capture and try him, even though you *could* kill him?	0
One theme we see throughout comments is that debt sold adds confusion as to whom is the creditor, and also triggers a new credit entry, making the debt appear as incremental (additional), when it is simply transferred, and fresh. The solution to this is simple; do not allow credit bureaus to ever list more than one entry for the same debt. Put the burden of accurate recordkeeping on the bureaus, because they are the only entities who have a responsibility for accurate recordkeeping and they are paid to keep accurate records. Currently the cost of sloppy systems is externalized to both creditors and borrowers, both of whom tend to re-externalize it to other creditors and borrowers in the form of higher costs. It is irrelevant whether these dual entries are caused by negligence, incompetence, or malice on the part of the creditor or collector because it is the responsibility of the credit reporting agency to make this practice impossible. Adding steep fines for double reporting would incentivize CRA's to police their systems so each debt only garners one entry. Since CRA's are immune from libel suits in most of the country regulatory oversight is especially important. Conversely, clarifying that reporting agencies are not immune from state libel laws -- that regulatory authority is in addition to state defamation law -- would also quickly incentivize more accurate reporting.  	0
I think that immigration is not really able to solve this problem; this is also very clear in my area, because in our country, for example, they want to hire Chinese, who demand wages that are twice as high as in Poland but this is not a solution in the long run.	1
"This is entirely too much information to require. It's not the job of creditors or collectors to send notices about ""best practices"" or personnel information. This thread is about notice that a debt is assigned to collection. NOT sold, but simply outsourced to someone who specializes in collecting past due debts. Notices is given when the validation notice is sent. The company who sends it is the collector; the letter itself will state the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed. That's enough.  "	0
Did it occur to you that you were taking introductory classes? Even if they weren't at the introductory level, some humanities classes are made for students in other programs to take as electives. If you had aced something like critical perspectives or Middle English I'd be more impressed. Also, not all STEM students pick it up as well as you did. I've seen plenty of engineers get their asses handed to the by an English course. I took an elective commerce class where we had to do a group project. My group was mostly engineers and biology majors. Before we handed it in I had to hastily rewrite the whole thing because so much of what the others wrote wasn't even readable.	1
Indeed, the children who were born here, well, they stay here, they go to school here, they grow up here, okay. But it also happens very often, that these children who grew up here, who want to get married, finally return to their country to get married. So they also bring one more person to Belgium or Europe. I think that's one more person. And well, it is perhaps also a problem, which we could try to solve, but there are also sometimes arranged marriages, in many cases. So, that I find... I agree, for those who live here, who have children here, who get married here, who become grandparents, there are many who still don't speak a word of Dutch or French and for the time they have migrated they still need an interpreter to come and ask for something or to express themselves. There are many of them. My sister, she lived 15 years in Madeira and the first thing she did was to take a Portuguese course and then she spoke Portuguese and she integrated in this country. She also worked and well, this migration, I find - she has come back now - but I find that, this is a migration that is possible indeed. I would agree with that. But if we... there are a lot of people who, well finally we go and look for them, we get married, and then they come here again with the person, so it's a problem that is added to the ordinary migration.

I wanted to come back to what Brigitte said to say that, yes, indeed, humans must be taken for what they are in the positive sense of the term. This, when Brigitte talks about Kleenex, it is already far from excusing all, but it is already what is done, when we relocate a company elsewhere. So, I'm not necessarily trying to link it to immigration.	0
Well Kantian ethics is ridiculous. Either you take it very literally, in which case you're not allowed to be consequentialist. So you can't lie to the Nazi officer who wants to know if you're sheltering any jews. Or, you make mini situation specific categorical imperatives, so, everyone should always lie when a nazi officer comes to the door and asks if there is a jewish man in your house. Problem with this is, it's tautologous, all it's saying is that in every situation do the right thing. It's not helpful, really it's just the doctrine of double effect/consequentialism framed really unhelpfully.	0
The OP is actually much more clever than you all are giving her credit for OP has only made a comment about what happens IF Batman can escape the first fight - so any crazy-powerful superbeing wins but is not relevant to the discussion. What we really need is some sort of Lovecraftian villain that would allow Batman to escape the first fight, but which would nevertheless gradually take over and *become* insurmountable (maybe zombies, in general, although tbh I don't know if they count) That, or somebody who reincarnates as a more powerful being (Phoenix?) or who could just outlast Batman (Hulk / Wolverine, maybe)	0
I don't think smoke breaks should be allowed at work, CMV I am a smoker myself, but I never smoke on the clock. Hell, I don't even bring my cigarettes to work. I don't think it's fair that people who don't smoke have to work while people who do smoke (an addiction brought on by themselves) get to leave work for the 5 minutes it takes to go smoke a cigarette a few times during their shift. Three of co-workers take smoke breaks at least 4 or 5 times during a shift and I continue to work. I can't really take a break myself because I don't really have a reason to take a short break (because I don't bring my cigs to work). Smoke breaks have been a very common thing amongst most of the jobs I've had. So I figured there might be a good legitimate reason behind it, so I'd like to have a discussion about it. CMV. EDIT: [This reply]( changed my view. If someone feels the need to smoke, they'll get frustrated when they don't smoke and become less productive. To keep them productive and happy workers, they'll let them smoke to keep everything going smoothly.	0

"I have a few objections to your reasoning, and I'll do my best to explain them. &gt; Voting, at least in the United States encourages an us-versus-them mentality, creating a vicious atmosphere. Wrong. It's been shown that it's not *voting* that creates the Us vs Them atmosphere, but that such thinking is inherent to the labels themselves. There was an experiment [edit: [Link](] which presented subjects with the same media clip, but with a lead in emphasizing divisive labels (eg ""We're trying to find the opinions of Republicans/Democrats/Conservatives/Liberals on the following news report""), unifying labeles (""...opinions of Americans..."") or without labels at all (""...opinions...""), and the first group reacted significantly more strongly to the partisan slant than the third group, who reacted more strongly than the 2nd. As such, it is not *voting* for a republican or a democrat that makes you more partisan, but *thinking* of yourself as a republican or democrat (or any label, really). &gt; The voter is asked to accept a political party's complete list of economic and social ideals. You cannot separate individual issues at all--you have a few packages to choose from, no matter how much you may disagree with parts of each. This is the nature of representative democracy. Except because we're not a parliamentary system, in the US we don't vote for a *party's* ideals, but on a *candidate's* ideals. That said no candidate's ideals match yours to the point that you can vote for them in good conscience, then by all means, don't vote for them, but to decide ahead of time that it's not *possible* for a Republican or Democrat to hold the same values as you do is just as horrible a prejudice as deciding ahead of time that a black person or white person cannot, either; in both cases, you're treating people as their labels, rather than as people. &gt; People who join and actively support one political party or another submit to a certain degree of mob mentality. This is true, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't *vote,* it means you should not join a party. So long as you continue to *actively* think of yourself as independent, you will be able to resist that trend. &gt; Voting selects for traits such as charisma, popular appeal, and so forth, rather than competency in governing. Wait, you're rational enough to see that he masses *don't* think, yet you're just going to sit back and let them run the elections? That's silly. If you're better than that, vote on *substance.* Places like ballotpedia collect lots of good information on all the topics and candidates on your ballot. If you do your research, you can balance out at least one Charisma based vote with your Competence based vote. &gt; created purely to show that the politicians uphold the views of those who voted for them ...but that's their *job,* to reflect the will of the people who elected them. You wouldn't ridicule a state for enacting an initiative ""purely because doing so upholds the views of the people who voted in favor of it,"" would you? What's different here? And my final challenge is possibly the most important one: &gt; I intend to go to the polling location and submit a blank ballot That, fren, is *worse* than not voting. That potentially enables [an unethical poll worker]( to submit a vote in your name. Besides, isn't that doing exactly what you're complaining about in your antepenultimate paragraph? ""If you're a [blank] voter, you've Done Your Part to ~~support the democracy~~ protest!""?"	0

"I think the ""unless"" part of the rule about contacting a person more than once should be scrapped. They should not be allowed to contact anyone (other than the debtor him/herself) more than once. If the person (usually the innocent family member) they contact to try to locate the debtor is willing to give out contact info, fine. If not, whether they have it or not is beside the point. They should not be forced in the middle. It is not their debt, or in any way their responsibility. And when collectors claim they can't give their name or a return phone number to be passed on because of privacy reasons, how can they expect someone else to share personal contact info with a stranger?

"The problem isn't that the media wants ""views"". What else would media ever want? The only reason to broadcast *anything* is if you want a lot of people to see it. The problem, if it exists, would seem to be that the media wants to get *paid* for views. But that's been the model of media pretty much for as long as it has existed. Any time you get something for free on the internet, you are not the consumer, and what you're seeing is not the product. *You* are the product, and what you see is the means of production of that product. You get something nice, for free, because someone wants to pay someone else to buy your attention. And any problem we have with the media showing us what we want to see is a problem with *us*, not with the media. You're complaining about the wrong actor in this play."	0
The effect of being illegal, there is an answer behind it. When you do something illegal, what do you get out of it? You're welcome. It seems so obvious to me that it's illegal. I couldn't imagine entering a country where there are well established rules. So it's basic. If you establish laws and you don't respect them, then who are you? Even the one who is illegal, he says: there we can do what we want. That's all.	0
"I am a 21 year-old who is rapidly becoming a hermit/recluse. I don't necessarily see anything ""wrong"" with it. When I was in high school I used to care a lot about how people perceived me. I didn't have many friends and was fairly shy and whatnot. In college, during my freshman year, I thought I'd make changes to my life to become more sociable. Unfortunately, I didn't change much because I stayed at home for school to save money, and moreover, I was still fairly shy. I'm in my last year and the pressure is beginning to pile up. Need a job, need research experience for grad school, still need to take tests, keep resume updated etc. On top of that, I want to keep my main hobby (writing) alive. I'm finding that making friends is becoming less of a priority. But at the same time, I'm seeing myself turn into an extreme hermit of sorts...what's troubling is that now I don't care. Before I cared about appearances, having lots of friends...now I have like, literally, 1 or 2, and I hang out with them maybe...once every couple months. Otherwise I really don't hang out or go anywhere. When I look at others, I can definitely tell that this is not supposed to be the norm. People go out on the weekends, have at least friends who text them about stuff that's not school related, go out to bars, have experiences. I just don't care anymore, but I think this may be dangerous. My twenties are supposed to be vibrant, or at least that's what novels and movies say. Change my view. I don't really necessarily want to be a hermit anymore, but at the same time...my parents don't have friends. Older people I meet seem to not have friends. When I was growing up, most of my classmates' parents didn't have many friends. It seems that having friends and ""doing life"" is something reserved for the young...then people have families/get hitched and loose interest to go out."	1
We will always have a problem, because immigration is linked to culture, to religion. And so we have big problems, take Arab women for example. We have escalations in the hospitals. They come to give birth in hospitals. And they don't let themselves be treated by a doctor, it has to be a woman. And some crazy men fight with the doctors because for them it is illegal to [...] touch a woman who is about to give birth. And this causes enormous problems. So there is this problem of immigration, that's one thing, but the problem of culture and religion that are also combined. So I don't know, it's a very complex story and I think we're going to see in the coming years. Very, very big problems next to that.	1

Few years ago in Italy there was a first official case about it. They gave jobs to a big amount of immigrants and let them stay in Italy. So many immigrants from France and Germany came to Italy. So I do not think that such a big procedure of legalizing immigrants is the best idea and solution. Such people should be integrated in the society. Of course we can not reject them on margin; this is also not a good solution. I also think that all of these people should be somehow integrated in the society. Of course, everything here depends on the individual situation. I’m talking now especially about the people which should get political asylum. Not all of the people are coming for economic reasons, also criminals [are coming], and we should remember this as well.	1
"I had surgery at a hospital in 2006. I have 2 forms of insurance, both excellent. Therefore I rarely have a medical bill to pay, or it is for a very small amount. Sometime after the surgery (I do not recall how long after the procedure), there were repeated calls to my phone by an actual person who said, "" This is (first name), give me a call at (phone number)"". Since we did not know the person, no one called back. We thought we should report it to the DONOTCALL list, but we had no company name to report. Finally I happened to answer the phone when that number appeared and the male voice said, ""you know what this is about, right?"" and I said, ""no"". He said, "" you have an overdue charge with (hospital name). You haven't paid your bill. I work with a bill collection company"". I said ""I have never received a bill."" He said ""really?"" I said , ""yes"" He said, ""Call accounting at the hospital"". I called the hospital and they said to talk to my insurance company. I called my 2nd insurance company and they said both the first and the second insurance company had paid the hospital. The 2nd insurance company said I did owe money on the bill, something like $1.08. A bill collection company had been hired to collect $1.08 for which I had never received a bill! I asked both insurance companies to send me additional copies of the Explanation of Benefits. When I received the copies, I sent them to the billing department of the hospital with a check for the amount that the 2nd insurance company said I owed. I never did receive a bill. Nor was i warned it might go to a collection agency. A collection agency was hired for an amount just slightly over $1.00. Because of this experience, I do not plan ever to use this hospital again if I can help it. My family has had referrals to doctors associated with this hospital, but I always try to get a doctor who is not associated with it.  "	1
In Spain, not everyone who comes into the country can actually get a job. In Spain we have a commission, a council, an advisory board, where then also members from the unions, from the companies, from the government are represented. And for each province in Spain, the employment needs on the labor market are then examined. And on the basis of these assessments, they then try to find workers. And then there is also a system of investment in the country of origin, especially if that is a country that is very close, so that is clear, if we don't help the countries outside the EU, then we can never solve the problem. So we really have to find a balance. Since this law was passed in Spain, a lot has changed. You saw that in the summer, when many immigrants came by boat or by plane, everything actually went quite well, because the employment needs, the needs of the labor market were taken into account. That more or less worked, but I think it has to be extended to the entire EU, so the needs of the labor market really have to be assessed and then there can be a common policy for the whole of Europe. Otherwise, you shoot each other in the foot and then no problems are solved at all. It is important, for example, that this cannot be left to the companies alone or only to the political parties, because if, for example, we have a political party that has a different opinion than the others, then there should be such a commission, such an advisory board, which consists of the different layers of the population, of the different parties concerned, and then the needs are evaluated. The trade unions, the governments, the companies should then participate. Because at the moment it is mostly the case that only the companies have a say. I think that everyone should have a say in this. Social agencies don't really have a say either. But it is very important that they participate. We really have to make sure that each country decides what its own needs are, and then there should be such an agency at the European Union level, in the European Parliament, so that the common needs can be assessed. And then it will be decided whether the guest workers, the immigrants will be allowed to come to the EU. On the other hand, we must then also help in the countries of origin. Everyone understands, of course, when there is such a problem. Then, of course, one's own interests are always represented. The political interests, the economic aspects are brought forward when there are problems. Of course I have my political ideas, I don't deny that either, but I don't really have a political option. I can only represent the workers, because we also have to earn our bread. So I can't just say, yes, that's the lesser evil.	1
"There should be limits on how much money a family can lose to a Casino within a certain time-period. CMV A Casino just opened up near me, and it is HUGE!

It blows my mind when I think of how many families will be destroyed because the mother or father found an easy way to forfeit their incomes to gambling, alcohol, and expensive steaks. I have known half a dozen people, one of which personally, whose families were destroyed by gambling. By having Vegas styled Casinos in the middle of a suburb and in front of our shopping mall, our community will suffer. The negative effects that gambling has on middle / lower class communities is extremely detrimental to their financial &amp; social stability; especially with how it stagnates their climb up the socioeconomic ladder. My argument is that: we should define or enforce limits on how much a single family can potentially lose to a Casino within a certain amount of time. I understand how difficult it would be to legislate this, and it may be better to use more subtle approaches; but I seriously believe that a compromise could be reached. The simplest way would be to disallow excessive losses based on whether or not you have claimed dependents on your taxes. **Pros:** * Much of the ""high"" that addicts experience comes from the anticipation of their next win. It is the constant need for that gratification which drives their over-spending. As with drug addiction, when you delay the gratification along extended periods of time; addicts start finding better ways to focus their energy and attention. Of course, some will translate that desire to other addictions, but most realize that: ""I'm doing just fine without it."" * ~~I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp; money.~~ MVC. * The first step to conquering addiction is to admit that there is a problem. Casinos do the EXACT opposite, though, as they mask the reality with free booze and the constant lure of wealth. By at least recognizing the problem at the source, I believe more attention will be brought to the issues. Even if it's just as ineffective as the ""Smoking Causes Cancer"" labels on cigarettes, it's still better than nothing. **Cons:** * By regulating the Casinos, you encourage the establishment of illegal operations. These are more damaging to a community. * Extremely difficult to legislate, and Casinos would fight it to the death; no matter what the compromise was. * There may be other more effective ways to combat the problems associated with Casino culture, and this one would be controversial. [Here is a calculator]( which shows the average expected losses per/hour. Who knows how accurate this is, but we do know that Casinos are very profitable. TL;DR: If someone has children, the amount of money they can lose while gambling should be limited. So as not to feed the socio-economic reality where 'the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer'."	1
I think that the number of immigrants in my country is quite small. If they are coming then for sure to complement labour shortage. Especially in the construction field. During the last time, before the crisis, was such a big construction “boom” in Poland. However, Polish workers went to England, Ireland, or Germany because they wanted to earn more money. It caused that many Ukrainians and Belarusians came to Poland and complement the builders. I guess most of them were working illegally because it was much more cost-effective. However, I don’t see a big problem with immigrant at the moment in Poland.	1
As for medical collections, I very, very rarely see a legitimate dispute. Most often people are just trying to get the item removed from their credit or scare the collector with threats of FDCPA action. Many of the disputes we receive are copied directly from the internet and contain all kinds of demands for proof that are not required by any state or federal law OR even the rules of evidence during trial. CFPB really needs to address this issue and set a clear standard for what is (or is not) a legitimate dispute and how the collector should respond.  	1
So I agree 100% with the development aid as well. But we have to remember that development aid exists for three reasons: One, we want to have an economic partner at some point to buy our stuff. Second, we don't want a war to break out down there, that is, we want to strengthen the - yes, the social fabric, and only in the third respect is it completely humanitarian. But if a state, to which we have given an order to please keep your people in your country, does not comply or does not comply in the same way as we do, are we then really prepared to take this unpopular measure of stopping development aid there, with the consequence that it actually hits the wrong people there. Because those who have to take the responsibility are, so to speak, the governing caste of this country, and not the people who try to get out of this country to come to us. And then we're back to Wolf's initial question: How much do we dare? And our main problem in this context is simply that we as the EU don't have a contact like an African Union, otherwise we could of course say, we'll send all you illegals to the African Union, see how you get them distributed again and please make it very nice and pleasant for these people, yes? No, they just throw away their passport and we have to find out if they are Moroccan or Albanian or whatever, yeah?	0
"I believe men shouldn't be expected to put the toilet seat down for women. CMV It is considered common courtesy that when men finishes his business in the restroom, he has to put the seat back down for the ladies. In fact, many men are chastised and criticized for not doing this. This entire social ""courtesy"" seems absurd to me. We are continually working to level the playing field for women in society, and women and men alike often get offended when women are treated like dainty, delicate creatures who can't get their hands dirty. This is an archaic view of femininity that was used as a reason to deny the vote, women at work, and other socially and politically limiting rights for women. Expecting men to put the toilet seat down for women perpetuates inequality and this idea that women are too feminine to adjust a toilet seat. Men have to grab and raise the seat to use the restroom, and then touch it to put it back down again. Again, it's not so much the effort men have to exert, but about the symbolic gesture it sends towards our attitude of women. Men must do the dirty work for the women, and women can't get their hands dirty. If the toilet seat expectation were simply for aesthetic reasons, I probably wouldn't care so much, but the argument continually asserted for why the toilet seat must be put down by men is often that there ""are women in the house/office."" All I think it does it perpetuate age old sexism and views of femininity, and it is an outdated social custom that needs to be abolished for the good of all humanity. Change my view. **EDIT**: I mean just the seat, not the lid. The lid closes the entire toilet from use, the seat is what you sit on. I'm talking specifically about the seat of the toilet. **EDIT 2:** Shout out to [this comment]( by /u/Internomer for changing my view. I'll post here what I replied to him: Before you take this post too seriously: yes, I know it's only a fucking toilet seat, and no one is actually getting hurt/being sexist, but it's the theoretical/logical component behind it that I'm addressing. This original post was written in a kind of tongue-in-cheek fashion, with some broader, somewhat legitimate points being made. It wasn't supposed to legitimately piss anyone off, just create a friendly debate surrounding the custom. But anywho, shout out to /u/Internomer for chaning my view. ∆ This argument, one of choice, is the best answer I've heard, and it wins my support. Logically, leaving the seat how you left it means each person, male or female, has to exert energy the same amount of energy each time, either putting the seat up or putting the seat down depending on gender. This is all based on the assumption that a man must put a toilet seat up in order to urinate. But /u/Internomer rightly points out that a man can choose to urinate sitting down or standing, and taking this presumption into account, neither person of either gender would have to do any work because the seat would be down at all times. I also think it addresses the sexism aspect. A man exercising his choice to stand rather than sit is fine, as long as his choice does not infringe on the woman's necessity to sit. Should a man flaunt his privilege by leaving the seat up when he just as easily could have peed sitting down, I think he is inflicting harm upon the women. While there could still be a radical feminist argument lambasting a man for feeling compelled to put the seat down because he is sympathetic towards a woman's lack of privilege that a man has with his choice of sitting or standing, I think that's taking things too far. This argument wins!"	0
The next point that I think is quite acceptable is selective legislation to regularize illegal immigrants in a country, to give them legal status on a case by case basis depending on whether they have a job, a family and so on and whether they are likely to impose a burden on the public service. But there is no time obviously, we have not solved with the - we will have to come, the problem of people who come only to - after the traumas of visa, and that they stay in the countries, I do not want to evoke the subject of the prostitutes who come from the countries of the East, who come every six months, they are replaced, they come with visas, they work six months in France, they return and there is a new arrival. It's also an eternal waltz? of immigrations that for the moment there is no way to control it.	1
More information to the consumer with the initial notification would be more confusing and intimidating than it already is for them. Simplifying the initial notification while including information about how to contact someone if you do not recognized this obligation is the way to go. Then the CFPB can design and require everyone to send a separate Summary of Consumer Rights to a consumer. It could also be available in the exact same form on the CFPB website and on informed professionals websites within the industry. I would maintain the consumer's right to ask for a cease communication, but I would suggest that the CFPB would serve everyone better by including that the CFPB would suggest that the consumer may be better served by keeping this communication available except as a last resort. This solution also bears the added advantage of making sure the public is aware of the assistance available through the CFPB.  	0
Consider the Panopticon: It's based on a reliable observation about human behavior: that we act differently when we think we're being watched, even if we aren't. A dummy camera can often be equally effective as a real one. People restrain themselves when they think they're being watched, but the problem is that it's their own imagination of what the spy will do which governs their behavior. There is no policeman as effective as the one inside our own minds.	0
"I believe a woman cannot rape a man. CMV! Edit: Since I didn't follow the rules very well, let me expand upon what I mean. Sure, a woman can perhaps ""rape"" a man with a broom stick or something. I'm not saying that can't happen. And I certainly think a man can rape a man. I'm talking about penetrative vaginal intercourse. I don't believe a woman can rape a man in that way. **Last Edit: So it looks like this subreddit is pretty much a joke. Out of all the replies I got, only three even attempted to change my mind, and only one that I can recall was not openly hostile. It's really pathetic, considering what this subreddit is supposed to be. The vast majority of the comments were basically flaming and personal attacks, and ANY comment I made to clarify or defend my opinion was just downvoted into oblivion. It's kind of sad and pathetic that on a ""CHANGE MY VIEW"" subreddit, the userbase seems to be completely incapable of respectfully arguing with logic and evidence, and just succumbs to personal attacks. I shan't return here.**"	0
A neighbor who has since moved away has had her debts turned over to collection agencies.

I don't know if I understood this correctly now, but I think that to change the culture of an immigrant just because this person came to another country - I think everybody can keep his own original culture, which he has had since childhood and he grew up with. And it's possible, of course, that he doesn't adapt completely, but he should make an effort, of course, to adapt to the country he's living in now.	0
I believe that Kantian ethics stands as a good guide to live your life by. CMV. Wiki on the topic (sorry, mobile): I see nothing wrong with this theory of ethics.

Yes, we have to be careful when we comment, sometimes we interpret things a little bit, but have to be a little bit humble about it I guess. I noticed one thing in particular now for example. Selective immigration of businessmen and employers. Certainly we've seen that at first glance - it's a little bit shocking to me. Why should business leaders be leaders in immigration? Well, focusing on those who have qualification that are scarce to the EU, those should be admitted selectively? I, for example, would say that immigration should be led by employers already, because people who immigrate basically just want a job. If we have a job, we will automatically have an income, if we have an income, then we are just satisfied. After all, that's what we want. Self-reliance. Immigration should then be regulated or controlled, but the whole thing must already be monitored or controlled by the employers as well. Because they will provide the appropriate jobs. That's what I wanted to point out here in particular. But we should not read too much into it here. If we want strongly regulated immigration, that does not mean that we are no longer human. Yes? We can still want this and still be humane about it and still be a little bit altruistic.	0
Honest, respectful and open communication between consumers and collectors should be the goal. If there are too many roadblocks to making contact with a debtor, more consumers will find negative information on their credit reports and have more lawsuits filed against them. Rule number 1 strikes the right balance. If the consumer responds, the consumer will receive the mini-miranda disclosure and information about the debt. If the named person is not at the number, is it really so awful to call the collector and let them know? If calls contiue after that point from the same collector, then there should be penalties. Professional collectors do not want to waste time calling a wrong number.  	0
I think I do kind of like this idea. This designated database/website could also list Summary of Rights for state laws and Fed laws. Then this same website might also be able to be used as a way to report abusive behaviors (or link to the appropriate websites to do so), and other relevant information for consumers regarding consumer debt, credit, and credit reports, and other various useful information that is currently available but is spread across many agency websites. The website could be paid for and maintained by the debt collectors (sort of like how annualcreditreport.com is paid for and maintained by the credit reporting agencies). It could be a way to help bring legitimacy to the debt collection industry by having a way to identify them to separate the legit companies from the bad ones while allowing collectors to operate effectively.  	0
Yes, I am of the opinion that the task of the EU is not necessarily to close the countries and the borders, because we have to see everything a bit more globally, we are one world and the world consists of many other countries and we have to make sure that the rest of the population and the other people are well off in some way, which we have exploited over all these years. We have an obligation; humanity is a very important principle and I am simply of the opinion that we cannot close ourselves off and simply cook our own soup - how else are we going to deal with climate change and everything else that is coming our way if we only want to deal with it nationally? We can't keep ourselves alive at all.	0
Once a debt has reached the end of its statue of limitations is should be removed from the consumer credit report. However, collectors use the law to refresh old debts so they effectively never leave a report. If a collector can't sue to retrieve the debt it has no business on a consumer report.  	0
"I agree 100% with this statement. Creditors should not simply be able to pull your credit report at their fancy. I had so many soft pulls (this was before I realized I needed to opt out of marketing) that my credit report from Equifax got ""split."" Basically, this means that my report got chopped in half and trade lines disappeared. Also, a legitimate creditor attempted to pull my credit and was told by Equifax that I didn't exist. Everything was GONE. After numerous fruitless attempts at reaching someone at Equifax, I finally got a real person. I was informed of the split and told that the burden was on me to provide them with the correct information to ""put my report back together."" I had to fax them my driver's license, social security card, and a utility bill, all because their software cracked due to too many inquiries that I didn't even authorize. It's still not resolved, and I've filed a report with the CFPB.  "	1
"If a debt is to be turned over to a collection agency, the owner of the debt should be required to send a fully itemized statement to the debtor. The statement should have a large-type header, something like, ""[NAME OF CREDITOR] IS TURNING THIS DEBT OVER TO [NAME], A DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY."" This would give the debtor another chance to pay in the simplest way, before getting tangled up in idiot phone calls, and it would help the debtor identify the debt. The debt owner already has the itemized bill; it would be just a matter of copying it again and sending it. there should be a requirement that the original creditor make a true, good-faith effort to contact the debtor. I've dealt with those who do this, and those who don't. Some will send you a bill, and then when they get no answer, call you and check the address, which is often wrong. Some, it seems, hardly wait for the ink to dry on their first bill before they turn it over to collection.  "	1

"I dislike gender identity as a concept. CMV. Okay, so here's my understanding of the issue. Everybody is born either male or female, and this is your sex, but whether you are a man or a woman is a an issue of identity, and is independent of your sex. That is, one can be born a male, but later on in her life, realize that she identifies with women and women traits, and thus decide to identify as a woman. She would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns, start wearing girl clothes, practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine, may or may not get genital/chest surgery and/or hormones, and then, she would be a girl, and do girl things. Here is where I have the problem. What are ""Girl traits""? What are ""Girl things""? I have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and non-discrimination. I dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race, orientation, etc., and as such, **I don't consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine**. And I think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits are. When did we decide what traits are? What is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl? Or a boy for that matter? What, if you're...sensitive or something, then you're a girl? I'm a pretty sensitive guy! And I can tell you, there's ALL SORTS of things that I do that other people would consider ""Girly"". But the thing is, I think people are full of bullshit. I mean, I don't really *care*. If people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns, I would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldn't correct them. It's just, I don't get it. To me, assigning certain traits to a gender, and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seems...backwards. It seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles. Like, if you're a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresses...well, wearing dresses doesn't really help you identify as a girl, does it? All you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl. All wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look. That's not about how you perceive yourself, it's about how you want society to perceive *you*. Like, when you tell me you're a girl...well, great, I just learned nothing significant about you at all. That doesn't give me room to presume anything about you, it gives me no information. So why is it such an important identity to so many people?"	1
I would say that the people which are coming to the EU from the non-EU countries sometimes sell their entire wealth because they need money for the journey, which is very expensive. Afterwards, when they are coming back to their own countries, they have nothing. It is not that simple to just let them go back to their own countries and look for help in the country from which they fled.	0
Yes. There is nothing left, but just to agree with this. However, I would like to respond to what Frans said. I would like to stress that it is good to have in mind that there is a difference between these groups of immigrants. I am referring to Muslims in plural. It is a vast group within which there are definitely some differences. At the same time, I think, that considering the present situation, when there are some difficulties with accommodation, e.g. there are 20 people living in an apartment being designed for 5 people – well, that is a problem. A problem for a neighbourhood, so the government or maybe even the European Commission should do something to improve those people’s situation in order to avoid conflicts. Those conflicts often result from the fact that too many people live on a small area. I assume that everyone knows Paris or Rotterdam. In those places there are districts with many houses in which no one should live. However, there are just too many people and this is what puts pressure on social issues. If we would be able to avoid it, we would have far less problems.  	1
To stay with the asparagus; if now an unemployed person is sent there, a German unemployed person, then he will, under certain circumstances, if he now works for a certain time, or just like these short-time workers - now I've read a headline somewhere, that they are in a very stupid position, because they have to pay a lot of back taxes, and probably a lot of them would be unemployed anyway. And it's all like that with these asparagus stealers. If I harvest asparagus for a few months, I might get even less money afterwards than I would have gotten before, right? So you have to do all that too - it's all like that....	1
Consumers need to be pro-active in everything they do. If an individual had the capability to take on a debt then they should have the capability to resolve the debt. Every credit union I know goes the extra mile to help their members achieve financial success.  	1
"I had to spend quite a bit of time dealing with their repeated calls. Of course, they weren't looking for me but rather for someone with my very common last name and first initial. I had many calls from them one day. Apparently, their telephone representatives were trained to hang up if they received any response other than, ""How do I pay?"" They'd hang up on me before I could complete a sentence. That particular day, either by accident or through malice (I suspect the latter.), they had their robo dialer programmed to call back immediately. The representative would hang up on me and before I could step away from the phone, the robo dialer would call me back and I'd be speaking with another representative who would hang up on me. After many such calls and hang-ups, I was finally able to get a representative to stay on the line with me long enough for me to explain that they were calling the wrong person. After that the calls stopped. As I think back on this experience, I find it quite comical, but I didn't at the time. I did file complaints with the FTC and my state's Attorney General.  "	1
I believe all of the possibilities listed are necessary. I never did business with Joe's Collection Agency and would never recognize any debt they allege is owed.

"It has been my experience that practices can vary greatly between various creditors who find it necessary to turn delinquent or defaulted debt over to a collection agnency. In my situation, little or no notification was given. At a minimum, a creditor should give specific information as to date and which company the debt is being assigned or sold to. Getting such a notice would help me understand that there is going to be a change with whom I would be communicating with going forward. The costs and expenses or problems that dad honors are collectors would have been giving those is miniscule compared to the problems cause by not giving notice. I would argue that they would actually save money in the long run like giving such notices. At a minimum, The information that should be clear that in the notice is (1) the date of when the debt would be turned over to collection agency; (2) the name address of the collection constant company to whom the doubt was assigned; and (3) specific formation about the debt collection company and a list of that company's ""best practices"", policies and procedures as to what the consumer can expect. It would be good if there could be a single-point-of-contact for this company as well as the supervisors and owner of the collection company. Collection agencies need to be forced to deal more forthrightly with consumers and be required to deal with greater transparency.  "	1
I am sorry, I forgot that I should introduce myself. I think that we should introduce a differentiation between individuals from different Islamic groups. Muslims are not all the same. There are those who want to be a part of some European community. There is a small external group, maybe fanatics for real, and unfortunately public opinion associates all groups with them. The society sees all the groups through the prism of those small fanatic groups, what often leads to wrong opinions.    	0
As it comes to economic immigration, it concerns the labour rights, so we cannot let them not being adhered. That is why such illegal practices should be fought against. Those who are willing to be paid less than a given countries average wage, but higher than in their countries..hmm.. Maybe they are the victims of some kind of long procedure. I do not think that there is any benefit, neither for them nor for countries. In Belgium, and also in my town, there were employers on whom penalties were imposed for employing illegal immigrants. So something like this takes already place, and the penalties are imposed.   	1
Yes, maybe what has stayed in my mind a little bit now, I would suggest that one pays attention that one does not... it seemed to me before that Christianity connects with that democratic values are possible and that this is not possible with Islam. The two religions are not so different, in fact they are very similar in some ways. And if you look at Christian history, it has very little to do with democracy. And I wouldn't play the two religions off against each other, because it's just as possible in Islam to live democratically and Muslims also have these as well as values and Islam and democracy are not mutually exclusive in my opinion. And when we say European values. What is that? There are 27 member countries where partly the mentalities within these member countries are very different. And where in the individual country, for example in Austria there are Austrian values, there are about 8 million Austrians, you could say there are 8 million different values in Austria. And as many different values as there are EU citizens. It is always the question, what do we mean by European values? What do we mean by adapting to these values? That comes out a bit, that only these common European values make democracy possible. I would like to question that, basically that this is the case. We put ourselves higher in Europe than we actually are.	0
So if it comes to for example the situation in Italy, I know some cases when people came to Italy and their situation was legalized. For this reason, many other immigrants came to Italy.

Yes, we had already established just now that there must be certain rules for this. So, it has already been said about the borders; there is a little bit different discussion but not too many people should come into the country, so that a certain prosperity, so that a certain level is created, so that also those who come to us have the appropriate education and can also adapt to this level, that they get this opportunity and I think that is for the EU of course once from the basic structure the task, so to bring these ideas to the national level, so to open up possibilities, fictions [visions] and then within these national levels then to use these appropriate mechanisms, which are then for each country specifically of sense. Because you can't say that within the whole EU all mechanisms are of equal value, but it has to be handled differently and I think that's this big challenge and accordingly it could only work - in cooperation - that the EU develops these visions and in the countries they are then implemented with a lot of expertise and a lot of good policy.	0
Allow the States and/or local courts administer lawsuits. Regardless of any added rules, documents, etc. none will help increase debtors attending hearings.

The first entity I will probably take to small claims court and possibly file a complaint with Kamala Harris. The second incident I started sending faxes messages in big bold letters to the same fax where my prior faxes had been lost, asking other workers to look to see if they had taken the papers by accident. I also faxed overnight warning those who might have access to that room that taking fax documents could lead to their arrest. I did this for several days in a row. It was the only way I could think of to apply a much needed enema to those who have established a routine and can't shake free from it. Of course this assumes that they care.  	1

You can save a life for $2500 today, but that doesn't guarantee that any people are saved in the long term. Donations to save Rwandans from malaria in 1990 were not as effective as they seemed, especially considering that the ensuing slaughter seems to have had as much to do with overpopulation as with ethnicity. A $2500 donation to physics research at a state college won't save any lives in the short term, but it will rachet humanity ahead in a way that is much harder to undo than increasing the population of an impoverished country. And if there is a better state of society ahead of us, then by shifting us toward it, this donation may save more than one life.	0

We had already said earlier that because of the aging of the population, it is very important that we provide for the next generation, so to speak, which we ourselves are no longer able to offer, so such a new generation must also be led, developed, educated; so it is actually very important right now in this period that we start so that our pensions are also secured in the future.	0
Keep in mind, a cease and desist letter does not stop a debt collector from attempting to collect a debt, it only stops the debt collector from communicating with the consumer via whatever method the consumer requests the contact to stop. This does not mean a consumer no longer owes a debt. I do agree with the fact that a debt collector must notify the creditor of disputes. As a matter of fact, legitimate debt collectors do this on a regular basis. As a debt collector typically does not own the debt, they're unable to control what a creditor does with that information, all they are currently able to do is implement internal controls that protect the consumer and the agency. In my opinion, a legitimate dispute should be defined as currently, a consumer solely mentioning the word dispute requires action on an account. I believe some sort of requirement should be imposed as to WHY an account is being disputed and some sort of evidence be provided to support the claim.  	0
As far as immigration is concerned, I think we should look at this problem in a more general perspective. Immigration has existed at the European and global level for a long time and it will continue to exist for a long time. We should think of solutions and ideas to use this immigration, this flow that comes and goes in our interest. It is true that immigration, and I believe that immigration should be selective. And this selection would be at the level of education and expertise or abilities in one field or another. It is true that everyone can choose to come to a European state, so that they can live better, to gain autonomy. It might be a low step towards these ideas to try to solve the immigration problem to our advantage. So select in such a way that these people, these immigrants, can function, can help the European community in a development and not create a problem for the EU. For now, I still have some ideas and maybe I will come back with more comments. For now it's this. [1:	0
Massachusetts has this right. There need to be strict and enforceable limits on the number of times a collector can call during the week. I've received as many as 40 calls over a 5-day period from Citicards and calls every 50 minutes at work during the day by Wells Fargo. THIS IS SHAMEFUL AND THIS FREQUENT REPEAT CALLING HAS TO BE STOPPED BY LAW! Those of us who are in debt know it and don't have to be reminded over and over again. Calling numerous times per day or per week won't get the debt paid any faster. If you explain that to the collector on the other end of the phone, they blame the repeat dialing on their computers. Now that's lame. The computers can be programmed to call once a day or a hundred times a day. Once is enough.  	1
I dont understand why bill collectors are so stuck in ancient times. I get so many calls and its annoying. I would much rather get a text or email. The phone ringing can be annoying and a text is more subtle. It also doesnt require me to hear a long dragging voicemail. I would rather get a text saying who they are and what they want. If I dont respond soon then call me.  	0
I think this question about the control of the influx of immigrants. How can we control it? How can we do selection between the immigrants? I think it is a good question and I was intrigued by that. I would like to get an answer for this question.	0
"First, I have learned there is a significant legal difference between 1) identify theft, 2) mistaken identity (see contract law Furthermore, that these three words need to be separated, clarified and their legal handling completely examined. There is almost zero legal remedy for wrong person found. More information would NOT have helped. The lawyer had plenty information but he did not validate any of it after he found my address. The clerk told me these lawyers and their agents are ""just going through the phone book/internet"" hauling people with the same first and last name into court thinking they will eventually find the debtor. A complete waste of court resources, an enormous expense to the innocent citizen, and the unlawful detainment and threatening of an innocent citizen and their assets. The debtor, it has since been discovered has left the county. The lawyer could have easily validated his information using online public property records from both the Clerk of courts and the County Clerk and found out the middle initial was not a match along with over 7 other pieces of identifying information that were not a match. The lawyer did not even do the simplest checking. I filed with the IARDC and nothing happened.  "	1
we have an agreement with Poland, so for the asparagus harvest and everything, that are [is] legal. From Europe, they come to us legally. They're not illegal, are they? Yes, and we have enough workers.	1
So far as we can currently understand, all life is cancer; self-perpetuating simply because it does. My argument against absolute certainty in existential nihilism is the belief that increasingly novel arrangements of materials and ideas represent the only kind of progress that is *potentially* meaningful to intelligent beings. If there really exists any 'meaning' behind intelligent life, all previous formations of human society and ideas produced have not found it. Thus, *meaningful* progress if there is any to be had, can only be found in directions unexplored. Forward advancements in science encapsulate all past scientific knowledge. Forward advancements in technology obsolete all past related-technologies. Forward development of moral valuations invalidate all past systems of morality. So long as it does exist, humanity's only legitimate goal is to build on upon everything 'previous' in order to accomplish novel progress. An intelligent mind sees no other alternative. Future formations of human life and intelligence can only be *potentially* meaningful so long as they are different than all that came before. Given the choice between zero and infinity, aim for infinity - even if infinity is incomprehensible. You and I already understand the meaning of zero, so why waste time on that?	0
"In order to get a default judgment through a State Court, a collector's pleadings have to spell out the theory of their case (usually contract) with sufficient specificity that a reasonable person can understand the basis for the claim. Without some form of affidavit from the actual creditor, very few courts will award a default judgment. Also, most state court approved forms are already written for the ""least sophisticated debtor."" I don't see any reason to impose a more stringent standard on collection lawsuits than are imposed on any other lawsuit.  "	0
Debtors should be able to leave a message for a specific debtor, the name of their company and request a call-back at a specified number. When a consumer returns this type of call, the collector or debtor should be required to give them the mini-Miranda warning. There is no need for collectors to leave messages revealing the nature of their calls. The Health Information Privacy and Portability Act prohibits disclosure of protected information to unauthorized parties and the same should apply to debt collectors.  	0
I would like to respond to what François [FRH] just said. I think that life in society is based on a certain form of legality - even if the term legality may offend. I think that we all have rights, certainly, but also duties, surely. And in relation to that, we can't do everything and anything, we have to stay within a certain framework, without this framework being too stifling, of course, but I think there have to be rules and we can't just move from one country to another without being subject to certain rules. Well, that's my opinion on the matter.	0
For me too, religion is not the means by which I judge people and it should not be, of course. Unfortunately, I must admit that many people are judging others by their religion, in what these people believe in, what they eat - meat or not - how they live... I guess it will always be like that. When there is such a big culture mix, there will always be people which will discriminate and it is sad.	0
After offering documentation that I didn't owe a debt, the collection company ignored what I offered as proof and continued to try to collect the debt even stated they didn't care that I didn't owe it. They should be required to investigate and respond in writing to a consumer's defense, so a follow up can be made, or complaint filed with a governmental agency. Documentation should also follow the claim as collection companies sell their lists to new companies. Better, no documented defense of a claim should be eligible for sale until resolved.  	1
"Debt collectors are very knowledgable in what they do. We are professionals. But debtors are not stupid and should be expected to do their own research and educate themselves to participate in their defense. Why should a creditor have to explain to a debtor how to avoid paying their debt. By the time it's reached litigation, those conversations should have already occured and the debtor should be ready to offer his defense without being ""taught"" by the person to whom he owes money.

So, what poses the problem is the illegal. Because with legal, we don't have problems. In principle, we are legal, so I don't understand why we beat. The big problem is the illegal. And when it is illegal, it means that it means. It means then with humane way, I don't have the right [?] to be here, we take them home, like if someone comes into your house, there is no big future [? And I think that in our country I want those who defend the culture, that it will bring something. I think that we already have 27 countries with different cultures, different languages, plus in our countries communities. I want to say that Europe presents other countries. Are not... I think it is already quite a lot. And I don't see why we should shudder people to come to us. Because it is a case very often, that's the problem. When you look at the news, and you look at the detention centers, it's a pain, isn't it? It was almost like Somalia. We have to take measures, sometimes very hard measures. That's why Europe and the European Parliament - it has to be something hard. Because we are already a small minority and we don't know much, you can imagine. When you defend texts or you have knowledge. It must be terrible. And that's why we have so much length [?] [1 :	0
"If a debt is to be sold, the owner of the debt should be required to send an itemized statement to the debtor. The statement should have a large-type header, something like, ""[NAME OF CREDITOR] IS SELLING THIS DEBT TO [NAME OF DEBT BUYER]."" This would give the debtor another chance to pay in the simplest way, before getting tangled up in idiot phone calls, and it would help the debtor identify the debt.  "	0
Well, I don't quite agree with that. It's true that employers abuse illegal immigrants because they really don't pay them much. [21.17]	0
It seems like it's a German problem, but Germany is a big country and they can take everybody. We in Denmark, live in a small country. In the eighties we had open doors and we cannot accommodate such a situation. We are a small country with a few million inhabitants and we want to keep that then, not that we had developed a xenophobia there. We just wanted to make sure that those who came to us could be integrated legally, so that they also represented or could represent an added value for Denmark but also for themselves. And we tried to find a solution there, but we are quite sure that those who thought that way in Denmark gradually became angry when they learned that more and more foreigners wanted to come to us, whom we also wanted to integrate and we had not only had positive experiences. So it's interesting to hear what was said back there.	1
yes, so I would like to speak for my neighbor here. What do we do with the immigrants that are already with us? So what do we do with all those who are already with us now?	0
When anyone makes a demand for payment from another party, it is incumbent on that person to produce the evidence to support such demand and not up to the second party to produce evidence that he is not liable for such alleged debt. Otherwise, anyone can create trouble and misery for any person out of mischief, ill-intent or out to make some fast money for himself or even to defame the second party, as proper businesses are adverse to bad publicity. If the first party claims to represent a third party to collect debt for that third party, then the first party (collector) must produce evidence that he is authorized by the third party to collect a debt for the third party alone because anyone can claim to represent any party in an attempt to defraud the innocent second party.  	0
"Here's what I would change about American gun regulations. CMV Stipulated: improving the way we regulate guns is not the only way to reduce the frequency at which we're violently killing each other. But it is **a** way. Let me also say that I'm reasonably sure that *something* needs to change about the way the 2nd Amendment is viewed. I'm less sure about exactly what should be done. Here is what comes to my mind. I may not be able to defend these ideas in much detail, and I'm interested in the community's thoughts. I mainly wished to argue ([as I did in another CMV]( that **something** needs doing. Indeed, if you don't agree that there is a need for more regulations or increased enforcement, or if you feel that it would be unconstitutional to do as I recommend, then we should discuss it in that other CMV. But I was [pressed]( for specifics, so these are some of the possibilities I think are reasonable. Please tell me what you think of these, and tell me what else you would like the government to do. 1. If you aren't properly licensed, you can't own or possess a gun. Getting a license means demonstrating some kind of proficiency related to safely and responsibly storing and using the weapon. Like a driver's license. And like a driver's license, demonstrating increased levels of proficiency and responsibility means you can own more (and more destructive) weapons, or even carry them in public. I'm not reflexively opposed to private ownership of, say, semiautomatic handguns, assault weapons or large magazines. But I'd like owners of those kinds of weapons to undergo frequent and intrusive recertifications, with the intrusiveness and frequency tied to the lethality of the weapons/magazines. 2. Getting a license involves background checks and some kind of mental health evaluation. The more significant the license, the deeper the checks. 3. You can't buy or own ammunition without a license. Maybe there should be restrictions or bans on especially destructive ammo. 4. I've heard suggestions of an exorbitant tax on ammunition. CMV, but I don't see how that helps. 5. If you are in possession of a firearm, you need to be able to demonstrate that you acquired it legally and are properly licensed. Just like a car. ""License and registration please."" 6. All firearms must be traceable. You can't sell a firearm except to someone licensed to own it. All firearms must be individually identifiable, and all firearms sales must be recorded and tracked. Just like a car. 7. You have to display your license to be ~~admitted to~~ served at such places as firing ranges, gun stores and gun shows. 8. If a firearm is used in a crime or is found in the wrong hands, the weapon's registered owner must be held to account. If you lost it or it was stolen from you, your license is suspended, downgraded or revoked because ipso facto you didn't meet your responsibility for safeguarding it. 9. The BATF and other enforcement agencies have to be funded and empowered to enforce these and other regulations nationwide so weaknesses in one state don't lead to a flow of weapons elsewhere. And a national database will, of course be required. EDIT: converted bullets to numbers for readability with /u/JOberlander's response."	1
"No, because what you're describing isn't a thought. We can't reason with it. What you're describing is your mind reacting to something it perceives as being out of the ordinary, incongruous with your own experience of the world. I grew up in a country with no black people in it. Literally none. One day, I found myself in a small room with a black family. I had never seen a black person up close before and certainly never been a minority. I didn't find it ""disgusting"" but my palms sweat a little, my heart raced. And I was so frustrated and embarassed by my reaction! I had always been raised to believe that racism is a terrible thing. The important thing is to distinguish between what your gut feels and what you believe to be right. They aren't always the same thing. People who cite gut feelings as support for their beliefs are to be treated with extreme distrust. Also, maybe watch a whole load of vanilla gay porn, or all five series of Queer as Folk. The exposure will probably get you over this reaction."	1
It seems to me that the system must provide a series of 'handshakes': When a dispute is initiated; when the dispue is resolved; or when a dispute is withdrawn. In each case the consumer must know with certainty that the collector acknowledges the consumer's position and that the CRA has been properly notified. The CRA must be party to the handshake, It is unacceptable that consumer's complaints can laguish for months with the consumer having no way to determine whether the CRA has received updated information from the collector or whether the CRA is taking unduly long to process the update.  	0
Yes, in Andalusia we have a system of legal immigration for 10 years, so from the Eastern European countries we have immigrants, and there we see that this is also changing. Now we have a lot more immigrants coming from Africa. For example, there are workers from Africa for picking strawberries or peaches for very specific seasonal work. If that is organized, it is also possible to divide that over the different seasons, over the different harvests. But as has already been said, if only one country works alone, no global solutions can be found. We must not forget that the illegal immigration, which is mostly the ships, that these ships that we see are often only a very small part of illegal immigration. A lot of illegal immigrants come via airplanes. For example, they come on vacation for three weeks and then stay for 30 years. So, those are some of the problems as well. It is, of course, that we also have these desperate people on the ships, but I don't think that is really the problem. The real problem has to be found in a whole other sector. I think we need to do a better job of coordinating the needs of the different member states. I just said that [see ], but there, of course, all the organizations, the social organizations have to be connected to that. Everybody has to contribute. It's not just the current government. We have Berlusconi in Italy, for example, you can see very clearly how this is going. In Spain, it's also different depending on the government. So I think we also have to see that very clearly. [Transmission briefly interrupted]. We have illegal immigrants, 700,000 immigrants, who immigrate illegally and then all of a sudden they get papers and they are Spanish citizens. They get social benefits and so on. They get social benefits, but of course there are very many companies that also take advantage of illegal immigration, that are cheap workers. I am also convinced that this is the reason why we have these problems. Because if there was really the political will to solve the problem, then we could definitely improve the situation. So there's a lot that can be done.	1
In NYC courts, a lawyer representing a particular party (doesn't have to be collection related) will have a full day of cases lined up which leads me to believe at least some scheduling preference is given.  	0
I would suggest a form from 0 to 10 and then two questions, what is our interest to integrate everybody and what is the interest to find a solution for example - so by just closing the borders for example. What is the interest for that? What would be the interest, for example, for Spain or Germany to close the borders? Because I rather have the feeling that they are trying to contain the danger and that they are trying to interrupt this flow now, and to integrate those who are here well.	0

I would have liked to ask this question to the European Union, because - to our experts, to whom we have to submit questions tomorrow. And precisely all that we have just heard, I was saying to myself, why don't we ask them the question: If the European Union is in favor of legalizing illegal immigrants, what would be the criteria for all the countries to decide, to select - this is perhaps not the right term, I apologize - to keep or to deport illegal immigrants. So what would be the criteria for choosing the legalization of illegal immigrants? But at the European Union level. That could be a question.	0
It is my companies practice to send a validation of debt notice to nearly all accounts placed. This is not required but a best practice. I also believe in most cases the original creditor provides notices to the consumer on their bill if they are going to be referred to collections. Also it is time to be realistic. Is it possible that a consumer is not notified of a transfer to collections? Yes. But that being said most if not all consumers know they have not paid their bill beyond 30 days and they could be sent to collections. It is time personal responsibility plaid a part in rule making and that the rules apply to the vast majority of circumstances instead of trying to account for the rare occurrences where the process does not work fully.  	1
I'm not saying now I feared it. Yes, I think immigration is a rather difficult topic, which every country in the EU, I think, has to judge for itself, can judge, should judge, because every country has different conditions to accept people from other countries. If I understood correctly, we are now talking about immigration outside the EU membership. There are different problems in each country, and now I can only talk about Germany, and then only from the area that I am now familiar with, or what I am now witnessing - it always depends on how the respective situation is in the region: In Germany, we have a fairly strong discrepancy between unemployment percentages in the metropolitan areas and in rural areas. If general rules are then drawn up by a higher-level commission - by the EU - but then ultimately apply right down to the smallest province, then I don't think that's a very happy solution, because every region has its own specific differences. Then, of course, the fears of the individual inhabitants play a role; be it because of unemployment, be it because of understanding, or just then also from quite different cultural circles. But this is a topic that I could probably talk about for hours without having the detailed knowledge, so I'll take the liberty of passing on the word for now.	1
Social Media: While the courts have made the rare exception for use of social media as a means of giving notice, not everyone is on every social media platform.

"I live in Georgia which seems to have laws that are very biased toward the debt owner. An example is the statutes of limitations for Mortgage debt. For instance, if the 1st lienholder forecloses, and you have a 2nd mortgage also, the 2nd remains in effect The OCGA states that the statute of limitations for any "" debt instrument under seal"", is 20 years from the date of foreclosure. The 2nd lien can be sold over and over and the last one holding it can come after you for up to 20 years. In these times when houses are lost due to catastrophic illness, job loss and other situations that not due to the irresponsibility of the homeowner, legislation should be drafted to protect the consumer from financial ruin.

Yes, I risk repeating myself to say that to talk about aid - maybe I was too quick to explain that, what Europe needs to do is not aid. Since always - when we see the statistics - there are always billions that are given to the Africans but it has not given anything, it has not given anything because I said earlier that the aid there is - the money does not arrive there as Madame said earlier. The problem that is there - even when we talk about quotas to come from Africa - these people will come, they will stay in Europe, they will not go back because the situation is more than serious over there, the situation is more than serious because people do not have - it is not that people do not want to work, but people do not have the possibility. I have colleagues who are doctors, who are engineers, and when I came back - people who were even practically no education - a walker from the street, he comes to France and [... I have colleagues who are doctors who can't even keep up with the small needs simply because it's the policy of - an effort must be made in - that is, to the organization of everything, that is, not to let the leaders, it's funny, because when you see an African president who stayed 30 years in power it's not normal, and people they know that in Europe, they know that but they don't do anything, they take people like sheep because it's -. A big country like Zaire that has a lot of intellectuals, but they take - anyone to be a leader but it's crazy because the people they don't arrive then. It is there practically everybody is prostituted there because it is money, that is to say that people they do not work, because it is difficult to earn - then, people they do not even know a very rich country or all the foreign firms entered to plunder simply because they do not want a good cooperation of the countries, they have to go there and not even in an official way and it's a roundabout way so Europe has to - it's not to give money, it's to make structures so that these people there that have proper structures and like democracy in those countries so that these people -.	0
If you are arguing simply based upon a utilitarian standpoint, think of this scenario: you have 3 individuals at a hospital that are going to die if they do not receive an organ transplant. One needs a new heart, one needs a new kidney, and one needs a new liver. Now down the hall there is a perfectly healthy man who has all 3 of these organs. Would not the utilitarian perspective be that we kill this individual to save the other 3 lives. Greatest good for the greatest number. Now this doesn't seem right does it? Individual consent is necessary from a moral standpoint. Professor Michael Sandel has a great series of lectures on this topic. Having mandatory organ donation would incentive murder and would cause society to put more emphasis towards this organ donation, rather than to what I believe would be the most practical method: increase the advancement of biomedical engineering and artificial organs.	0
I guess I should also have clarified in my previous comment that I have made attempts to deal with creditors directly if I know who they are and who they claim to be representing but my personal perception is they PREFER to continue contacting 3rd parties because they hope I'll just pay them to avoid the public humiliation. And in regards to a comment I read here that creditors can call a 3rd party again if they have a reasonable belief that the person knows how to contact the debtor, I disagree with that entirely. First of all, I'm not aware of any law that compels a 3rd party to provide current contact information for a debtor, so even if they do know where that debtor is, they don't deserve to be harassed daily for months or years as punishment for not offering up that information. Many people don't want to be involved and no law that I know of says they have to if they aren't a party to the debt. Secondly, there is no clear and concise way I know of that a creditor can prove what was a reasonable belief. My in-laws have no idea how to reach my sister-in-law because she wants it that way. They haven't spoken in 3 years and I don't see that changing. You can't assume that certain relatives MUST know where a debtor is.  	1
So now we are coming back to the topic how to (ugly word) segregate immigrants. Which of them we should allow to stay and which ones we should send back home. I cannot answer to this question because I do not know how we could check the amount of immigrants, which of course need help in a certain country and which at the moment are “parasites” and do bad things for the country, for example criminality (stealing and so on). It will not bring positive effects to the country.	0
Bank of America, my mortgage holder, does NOT even allow a formal dispute to move forward. The past 12 months have been a continues headache with Bank of America. For example, our mortgage account have always been current, and never were we in Foreclosure status, nor even approaching default. However, every single month Bank of America reported to the three major credit bureaus that we were late. I've worked with their Military Liaison Officer on the resolution through phone calls, email messages, and formal letters but without success. Urgent Help/Assistance is needed for consumers to navigate and to resolve the problems that Bank of America is creating over simple and elementary issues of basic accounting procedures. Bank of America has the undue power of making reports to the credit bureaus which adversely affects the consumer. The Consumer lacks tools to challenge and fight back on Bank of America's abuse of power.  	1
"CMV - I believe that the crimes committed by the Nazis, even though they were terrible, are a display of human nature First off I do not in any way think that the crimes were OK or justifiable in any way. What I do think though is that crimes like these are a perfect display of the human nature in it's most basic state. IMO it is natural for humans to be brutal and ""barbaric"". And that human kind as a total will probably never (or at least not in a long time) stray from the path of violence and brutality to a path of kindness and fairness because it is just a natural trait of humans to be brutal. Good examples to this are actually all the wars that have ever been fought. Sure sometimes you have to stand up against something but still a lot of situations could just be solved without using force or without starting a war yet humanity continues to choose force and war over peace and diplomacy. EDIT: I think I have messed up my formulation a bit. What I meant to say is following: A lot of people view what the Nazis did pre as well as during WW2 as inhuman and atrocious. I think that even if they are horrible things they are normal and give a good view of how humans as a species are. Or in other words humans are by definition and nature brutal and tend to be so. (Sorry somehow my English skills are just giving up on me -.-) **EDIT 2 (10.10.13 / 19:20 GMT+1):** I will take a look at your posts when I am back on my computer. To say it some things did make me start to rethink my views. Thanks for your replies so far :) CMV :)"	0
I would like to go back to the issue raised by Frans. He said that there is a part of the group which is extreme and wants to foist something on us. In my opinion, Holland has a problem with the legal system as it is not strict – weak, I would say. So one should consider what to do in order to improve this system and make it more efficient. If there were some sanctions, or punishments for these or other actions. When that murder was committed, I think everyone knows it was in Holland, everyone could see that the legal system was not able to impose an appropriate punishment for the guilty. So a jurisdiction should be developed, to be more strict. And I also believe that those fanatics should feel that sanctions could be imposed on them.  	1
Well, about immigration, if it is not possible to equalize wages all over Europe, then it would look very different, because no worker would leave his country and his family and expect them to move when he can earn just as much in Poland as in Germany. Why should he then emigrate? But at the moment the differences are considerable - in Poland he gets five euros an hour and in Germany ten. I would like to add, regarding the decision of the Polish government to raise wages; there it is really necessary to set the limit very high and our president attaches importance to the same handling in the whole European Union, because, if you can earn exactly as much as in Germany, then I don't need to leave my country to earn my bread somewhere else.	1
"My company calls, auto-dials, emails, and snail mails customers many times before they are sent to a collection agency. Many debtors simply refuse to respond to the original debtor. They only make payment after the account is assigned to a collection agency -- akin to seeing just how far they can go before there's a consequence to not making payment. Requiring a validation notice from the owner of the debt should be optional on the creditor's part. The FDCPA requires the collection agency to send their first notice after the debt is assigned. More notices from the creditor are useless and expensive. And the single most frequently used excuse of any debtor is ""I didn't receive the letter/invoice/statement"". A first class letter costs $0.55 minimum (inclusive of postage, paper, and envelope). That cost does not include overhead and employee cost. Multiply that cost by the number of notices and statements already sent (and ignored) and you begin to see the true cost of collection.  "	1
I think there is already a fundamental difference based on certain projects. For some people who are already in privileged situations, who can afford higher education and then have the luxury of being able to benefit from the Erasmus program and live elsewhere. When you compare just this kind of contemporary situation with people who are suffering, who are feeling bad. Well, I am not saying that these people should absolutely stay in their own country, but they must have good prospects for the future, for their well-being, in their own country. And this has to be said and repeated in relation to a kind of cooperation aid already in their country. Then they would not feel the need to emigrate.	0

"Yes, I do think your restrictions on workplace calls per week would be helpful, but I do not see any information requiring details on the content of Robo-Calls. For example, the calls I referred to earlier included robo-calls telling me that I had ""messages"" waiting for me in my Bayview Account, and to access these messages, I needed to call a special phone number. Well, this was a bunch of baloney it was just a recording wanting to know where I had sent my mortgage payment I had not set up an electronic deposit yet, like they wanted, so they assumed I was skipping a payment). I believe those robo-calls were fraudulent and misleading, particularly since I was never late on any payments, and I never had any ""message"" waiting for me. Just a robotic collection message. I received three of these messages and they are still saved in my cell phone voice mail.  "	1
I am of the opinion that one should absolutely help the Iraqis and also the Afghans, so that orderly conditions prevail there again. But how do you do that? I mean, everybody is ready to support the people and also those who are also persecuted there, that one should also take them in here. You also said earlier that we should not accept political refugees, that is, illegal political refugees, who are persecuted in their countries. So I would definitely be in favor of helping the people on the ground, even if with development aid or whatever, and sending experts there who can get the people to have water and yes, the whole infrastructure, so that everything is improved. That's much better than if we have to drag them all through here as welfare recipients and I think that might be a possibility.	0
Gypsies for me is a problem: They are Europeans, there may be a difference in culture, but at the same time there is a difference in culture between the French and the Hungarians, the Hungarians and the Italians, it's a problem of culture, it's true, but it's not a problem of immigration.	0
"Having gone through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy I can tell you that debt collector phone calls were the worst part of the bankruptcy experience. Massachusetts has it right limiting the number of calls debt collectors can make. That would remove one of the favorite illegal tactics debt collectors use to harass debtors. Some debt collectors would threaten to put us on robocalls so that our phone rang hourly until we agreed to a repayment loan schedule. Or they would threaten to call my spouse at work to see if he would be ""more cooperative"" and agree to a loan repayment schedule even after being informed that his workplace did not allow debt collection calls. Nothing phased these people and they appeared to enjoy verbally abusing me. Informing them that we wanted all debt collection to be written was also ignored. I could accurately predict who was calling by the day and time of the calls. Chase Bank called every Tuesday morning at 9AM. Bank of America called every Monday morning at 10:30AM. These calls were always professional and appreciated. I followed specific instructions given by our bankruptcy attorney who did not want the debt collectors to know that we were planning on filing bankruptcy in a few months. So I faithfully answered every single debt collector call for almost six months. I politely confirmed my identity. I confirmed I owed the debt and then I politely told each call that I could not start to repay the debt at this time. The banks/credit cards accepted this without a problem and remained professional. Others like GE Capital and the vacation time share debt collectors would then start with the abusive comments. Calling me a ""deadbeat"" and swearing at me was popular. Another popular threat was how they would harass us nonstop until they got their money. What finally put a stop to the unethical tactics was when they would call and inform me that I was being taped I then informed them that I too was now taping their phone calls. Most immediately hung up. A few would clean up their act and then act in a professional manner. The ability to tape debt collection calls is a powerful tool for the debtor to have and I would encourage this agency to grant debtors this right. Nothing cleaned up the bad behavior like knowing they were being taped.  "	1
The last contributions, I have to agree, it may well be that this is the case, but it is also always part of it that the country itself, which now accepts immigrants, that certain cultural circles are also conveyed to the population, because there are often misunderstandings in mutual interaction; that one simply does not understand each other and therefore the tensions build up. So I am absolutely of the opinion that the immigrant who feels accepted in the respective country where he wants to go, accepts the local customs and traditions very well or at least accepts them. As a guest in another country, I must also accept the customs of that country, so he does not have to give up his own integrity or his own culture, but he should not put it above the one in whose country he is staying. On the other hand - I can only speak for myself - it has already happened - and I'm talking about me personally in my job - that I had a certain reaction from the other person, who was not a German citizen, which I didn't know what to do with at the moment and also misinterpreted. Now, in retrospect, when you explain why this behavior was the way it was, it was actually a completely harmless thing, and that's why I think that this togetherness should be cultivated more; that is, that not only one side always demands, but the other also approaches it.	1
So first of all, on the subject of confession. This is what I wanted to say earlier. By saying, do we have to adapt perfectly to the country we arrive from or can we have a balance? In France, it is very different from Spain, it is very different from most of the other European countries, we have a requirement of secularism, that is to say that we do not have... there is a religious practice, Christian, historical, that is still active but in place of secularism above in the sense that religious worship is of the private place. So, we cannot, for example, hold this discourse, to say that the immigrants who come to France must respect a Christian tradition, for example. It is something that we can say, but in effect, it does not appear in schools, except in private schools. But we don't face it. So for me, the answer to the problem, to the possible problem posed by immigrants of Muslim faith, it passes by there in fact, secularism is what allows to respect the differences of each one. Well, that is perhaps also my conditions but when you speak about adapting, I personally, I adapt rather little to the French traditions, therefore and yet, I am French, I will not leave me. So that's it. So this story of saying that you have to confront a certain culture; you have to enter a form that... I'm finishing because now I have... Personally, I don't think that would be the right answer, because there are too many differences and I don't think that one country equals one culture in fact. That's it, personally. After that, on the story of the impoverishment of the countries of origin, and to say that we can't do anything, it's their choice, I think that it's not completely true. We have a mainly Muslim immigration, mainly from Algeria. It is important to know that these are colonized countries and I am not saying that they all come from there, but the same goes for African immigration. Today, there are multinational companies based in the West, in France in particular, which work there, and which do not necessarily participate in maintaining an economic fabric there. That is to say that in a certain way, if we really wanted to make political decisions about people in the countries of origin, there are ways to do so, through politics and economics. And indeed, as you said, people take incredible risks, they put their lives at risk, they put the lives of their families at risk, to immigrate in conditions, well, they do not do it from dictatorship, but it is not only a choice, I think in fact. So, these are extremely complex questions and I am not an angelist either, I am not at all in favor of a mass legalization of all immigrants, etc. The problems are too complicated in terms of the number of immigrants and the number of people who are not legal. The problems are too complicated in terms of - especially in financing our pensions and social assistance - actually today, we don't necessarily ask whether people work to immigrate. But in any case that's what I wanted to say.	0
I do not think that answering 97% of the calls from an automated dialer within two seconds is a solution to my problem. I would like for Mr. Dan to explain exactly what the safeguards of using a robo dialer are. From my perspective as a frequent recipient of robo calls from debt collectors, the problem is a lack of ownership and impersonality of the collection agency when the debt is not assigned to one collector to handle. Years ago when a collector would call me, it would always be the same person. Now it is not. Assign the debt to one collector who would then take full responsibility for making all contacts with the alleged debtor. This could even include acquisition of location information.  	1
"As a queer person, I appreciate that you're open-minded about this and recognize that your disgust isn't totally rational :) It may help you to know that while your disgust is a gut reaction, it is also heavily culturally reinforced. The fact that it's still with you isn't totally your fault. I don't know what it's like to be a young guy in middle school/high school, but from I what I know about it there's a whole lot of pressure to *not be gay* in any way, shape, or form. Other guys liberally throw around phrases like ""fag"" and ""that's so gay."" Some other people are replying saying that they had similar reactions when meeting black people for the first time. However, since overt racism is generally frowned upon in society, that disgust isn't as culturally supported, and you can get over it easier. I'm willing to bet that the disgust will lessen over time, especially if you make an effort to just be around gay people and watch them be casually affectionate."	0
The original comment was suggesting that anytime a debt collector calls they are automatically agreeing to be recorded if the consumer chooses to do so. I think that is a FANTASTIC idea.  	0
"In most states all that a debt collection law office needs to provide is a complaint. The average consumer has no idea what the difference is between a balance and a sum. they do not know how to calculate the interest and certainly do not know what is ""legal"" pursuant to state or Federal Credit Card Act limitations. The name of the Plaintiff may not even be recognizable to them. They just know that they owed some money and fell behind on bills. More times than not, they do not respond at all.  "	0
I am very divided about what I heard, because I think that for immigration, there was a time after the war when we had to build a lot of things. I'm in the energy sector and we had to draw very high voltage lines, we had to create railroads, we had to do a lot of things. And I think that at that time, we were very happy to find people who came to work, to integrate, to create wealth. So I think that immigration does not have the same meaning and the same stakes at one time compared to another. And already I think in fact it is the time that is important in my eyes. And now I would like to say that I think that it is not necessarily obvious to want to integrate people at all costs. I think that it doesn't work if there is no will. I'm talking about the principle that we all know more or less the work environment. I think that we live in a time when it is very difficult, when we see people who have done higher education, who have a bachelor's degree and then a master's degree, and who cannot find a job. I can't understand that someone who comes from somewhere else, who after three, four, five years, who doesn't have a diploma, who doesn't speak the language of the country, I can't see how they can be integrated. This is my point of view. Now, this may be part of a small minority, but I think that we should not make a... I think that integration can only be successful if the person himself has the desire to integrate. And that, I think that, to answer Brigitte, I think that there is no problem to have people come when financially or culturally, that seems to me less important, but financially, it is necessary to be able to make live in a home, to create wealth, to bring things to a country, that seems to me completely legitimate. We can see that in the last thirty or forty years, there are people who have come and worked in sectors where we did not feel like going. We can see that, to give a precise example, it's the cleaning companies, the metro, we can see that. So, no problem there. On the other hand, I think that the problem comes when these people arrive and who, apart from the culture, have difficulty integrating precisely because there is no will to learn the language and afterwards, to be able to look for work, to prepare diplomas etc. I think that the problem comes from the fact that they have to learn the language and to be able to work. I think that's where the problem comes from. But I think that someone who wants to integrate, I imagine that in European countries, these are not very atypical lifestyles, and I think that if someone wants to integrate, working and living between di and mi[?] like everyone else, I think that it doesn't impose a huge problem.	0
Innocent until proven guilty is the American Justice System. And the burden of the proof is on the one bringing the suit. Debt collectors need to get their act together before trying to file frivolous lawsuits.  	0
"This so-called ""validation notice"" might better be called a 'justification notice.' After all, the notification should supply the justification underlying the demand for payment; (""Why am I being asked to pay this money?""). This justification, obviously, should clearly specify the original transaction; i.e., specific product or service purchased, prior efforts to collect, (the history of the collection efforts) and present status. It's not so much 'additional information' which is required, it's more the clarity of the information provided. That said, I'm convinced that communications between creditor and debtor should avoid words like 'creditor' and 'debtor,' along with words like, 'charge-off', 'default' (already mentioned by myself and emmacollector in this thread) and any and all words that belong in an accounting 101 book. I understand what these words signify and sometimes I get confused by who's the creditor and who's the debtor. Again, simplicity, which entails clarity, ought to be the guiding principle.  "	0
1008 Looking at the immigration from the selective immigration viewpoint, these are only the qualified people. However persons who have no appropriate educational background, qualifications, but live in difficult circumstances, maybe even harder, those people would have to be tied with their country. However, those with qualifications would all go abroad. Who will stay in the country in this case? That is why that selective approach is not a solution at all, because it will be at the expense of some group of people who will be forgotten. And these will be unqualified people.	0
Well, I think that the basis of migration policy should already be the same. Because if it is different from country to country, then we will still encourage that in countries where the immigration policy is more flexible, more tolerant, there will be higher numbers coming there, larger groups. The basis should be the same, so that the burden for each country is comparable. Another aspect is not discussed enough, I think. Migration should not necessarily always be final, it could also be temporary. There are sometimes very strict and very rigid rules at the entry point of the migration movement, but not anymore when it comes to exit, when this should be stopped. There is no monitoring of the whole process to see if these rules and regulations are also met or consistently followed. At the entrance into the space there is a control, but when contracts expire or when a certain framework is covered then or the migration needs are met, then you should also regulate the exit again.	0
If I ever tell a collector that I'm recording the conversation, the call ends rather abruptly or the calls just stop. Yet, I'm expected to be recorded whenever they initiate the call. They expect me to have an expectation to be recorded when they want to attempt to collect a debt, but the minute I want to record them while I dispute a debt, that's out of bounds...  	1
"To this I would mention many many people donate to what emotionally impacts the donator. What if an underprivileged youth was granted the opportunity to see an opera, go to an otherwise unaffordable museum, or given the opportunity to go to college and this opportunity changed that persons life in such a way that they became hugely successful? Because of what helped them, the donator is going to support the organization that supported him/her. Basically, you are ignoring any possible emotional connection any donor may or may not have, which is to say most donors are really trying to give to the best causes. It just happens that not everyone agrees on what the best causes are. People are naturally going to give back to the organizations that helped them the most; in their eyes it is the best possible use for their charitable donation. Another thing to note: while plenty of people have pointed out that saving lives is not the only measure the effectiveness or worthiness of a charity, but I have yet to see anything that mentions fringe benefits (and a ""fringe benefit"" could be saving live). Who is to say that an underprivileged youth that received a life changing experience would not have otherwise become a murderer or some other detriment to society? Obviously complete speculation but I do think that it is worthy of note that these donations to universities, arts programs, and other ""non life-saving"" charities could, in fact, save many lives."	0
It is unwise to require that the debt collector send sensitive personal information to the debtor (e.g., SSN, account number as such a requirement would expose the debtor to the danger of ID theft.  	0
yes, I think they addressed this in a very differentiated way, the topic. We have in... [mic not correct] and namely once it is a big difference if we talk about the women or the men. Women are always more capable of integration and they also integrate better socially. Men react quite differently there. In my region we have had various other immigration cases. We have Italians, Spaniards, Greeks, Yugoslavs, Turks, then the boat people from Vietnam, now also black Africans and Turks. In our region about 60% are still Germans and 40% are immigrants from these different regions. In our region, the church has done very good integration work, most recently especially with the Russian Germans. At the moment, they are causing us the biggest problems, because they are alcoholics on a large scale, because they often do not speak German, and because they do not have the appropriate interests in the work. The next problem with us is also often the third generation Turks. Not the second or first generation, the current generation of Turks is no longer interested in working. I don't know why that is. But in general, I would say we have to accept these people and we have to [try to] integrate them in whatever way we can. Because they can't be sent back either. We have the problem that the people are there, they came as guest workers, the parents, and now we have to work hard with school education, post-education. Now we are challenged.	1
I would like to see some strict regulation on the number of times a creditor can call in a given period of time. Capital One Bank's dialers will call every single hour if a payment is overdue... sometimes these things are simply overlooked. If I know I am paying bills on a given day, I just use my caller ID and ignore them. I do think that these calls need to be at least limited. It comes down to simple harrasment.  	1
But the EU will have to regulate immigration, because the external states have different problems than the internal states. If you look at Berlusconi with Lampedusa, there are significant problems down there - so there will have to be a pan-European solution, because otherwise we'll drown, like the ancient Romans. They had the same problem 1000 years ago with the migration of peoples. That's it.	0
Yes, my name is Björn. If we talk about immigration in my opinion, we have to consider the aspect of right and asylum, because in my opinion many of the people who come to [us] come because they have needs and therefore they also have the right to seek asylum with us and therefore in the letter that we received, I noticed that it is mainly the economic aspects that are underlined and I wonder if the European Union, at the top of a pyramid, still looks at the human aspects and gives priority to the human aspects or if it is rather the purely economic aspects that are taken into account in the first place.	0
Now the thing is this: We have to make sure that we also have immigrants among them who are highly qualified and it is already the case that we also need some of them. And they can work with other people and improve the overall production in our country. Then there is also the problem that many immigrants, other groups of immigrants, come to Denmark who are illiterate. That's another problem that also needs to be solved. We have to make sure that we have the funds available to be able to work out and implement such solutions. And that is the case with immigrants coming to Denmark but also to other European countries. And it is very important that we have highly qualified migrants among them, which we really need.	0
Some problems that debt collectors and buyers have with giving consumers this information arises in the field of Electronic Data Interchange. Here, not all debts, especially with interest are calculated the same way, and since there are fees, such as statutory attorneys fees, and court costs, which can be added to the balance, calculating the balance becomes cumbersome when the data is transferred among Trading Partners on a daily basis because the data gets lost in translation over day-to-day lags. Computers don't think the same way people do and what we think is a simple calculation is muddled when partial payments are added and the data is transmitted between parties.  	0
I would like to respond. When we look at the EU as a unified market where there is a need e.g. for bricklayers so then other countries of the EU could come to the idea to send their citizens to the country where the lack of this profession occurs. So not every country would need to train the bricklayers. And when we talk about professions connected to technology, the EU should introduce a policy of avant-garde. A Focus is put on certain technology and education, so that a person could work for us and there would be no need to import workforce from outside of the EU	0
"The CFPB should clarify whether ""verify"" means verify that you are a legitimate collection agency (not a scam) OR does it mean to prove the legitimacy of the account relative to the debtor's objections. If is the former, some basic information relative to the account--contract, itemized statements, or any other identifying information that only the creditor would have access to would suffice. If CFPB wants ""verify"" to answer every single objection a debtor can cook up, a collector could never move forward without spending hundreds of hours normally reserved for litigation. As to a time frame on answering, I think the current system of stopping collection action until verification is provided is appropriate. Normally, sending the information to the debtor is not the hard part. Getting the info from the creditor and then circling back around to this particular account is what takes the time. I don't think disputes should be limited to the first 30 days, but should be prohibited once suit has been filed. The Court rules and discovery process provide the debtor all the access to this information they could ever need or want and the provide this access under pretty strict penalties from the Court if the creditor/plaintiff does not provide the info requested.

"I believe that racism is fundamentally a product of ignorance. I'm gonna borrow /u/nope_nic_tesla example from here: &gt;I think OP is talking about people who might say something like, ""Black people are savages. Look at their rate of violence compared to white people. This isn't racist, it's just a fact. We need to carefully deconstruct this hypothetical. The hypothetical fact here is rates of violence in black populated areas is higher than white populated areas. The actual racism occurs when someone goes from that fact to the *conclusion* that ""black people are [*inherently*]"" savages because they are ignorant of all the external forces in between. Racism is not a simple thing. It is complex and easily conflated with all sorts of other things. The fundamental point that combats racism is that there are no inherent superiorities or inferiorities due to race and that any admittedly factual discrepancies in rates of violence or what have you are *not* inherent and are actually due to external factors like socio-economic forces. &gt;People who talk about living in a ""post-racial"" society are basically part of this group. People who conceive of a post-racial society are not wrong at the level of their idealism. When I think post-racial I think a society that does not hold any beliefs that race inherently creates superiority or inferiority. This is not a racist ideal to hold fundamentally, but it does leave room for ignorance and mistaken logic. The problem is when someone assumes that the ideal has already been reached when it has not, because then they are blind to *actual* racism and might end up committing racism. So are people who believe the world is post-racial or point to factual discrepancies between race are not *wholly* ignorant. What they are ignorant of in the former case is that the world is not yet free of racism, and in the latter case that factual discrepancies that are *correlated* with race are not *caused* by race. So are people who are ignorant in aspects of their view *worse* racists than people who are *wholly* ignorant of the fact that race should not be held as an inherent aspect of causation? I don't know that they are worse, they are just mistaken/ignorant in different ways. I think that there is a sliding scale of ignorance that parallels the sliding scale scale of racism, and it can be hard to determine where a specific view or particular person falls on these scales. You can not be ignorant of some things, but be ignorant of other and still be ""racist"", but there are also racists who are even *more* ignorant that still have a lot of learning and empathy to experience before they cross the threshold of racist beliefs. Some ability for rational thought is better than no ability for rational thought upon which to fight racist cognitive structures. I totally see your point of view though, but hopefully some of this helps change your view!"	0
Please consider robo-calls when developing rules for this section. See my comments about robo-callers leaving messages on cell phones under robo-calling. I understand the need to protect privacy, but this is not the answer. The messages left for me on my cell phone could have been returned by anyone with access to the cell phone (family members, snoopy friends) and information on a supposedly late payment would be disclosed by the robo-caller. Robo-calling does not have the consumer's privacy in mind.  	0
You are correct. There is quite a difference between send and receive. All I am suggesting is that a creditor only be required to send any notice to the last known address - not that the consumer receive it. and you presume too much if you think that all mail is returned if not delivered to the proper recipeint), then the creditor must send the notice to that new address. If the point of this dialogue is to ensure the consumer is protected, then require the consumer to protect themselves and provide this information to the creditor. If they don't then a creditor can't be hanged in a lawsuit for a letter failing to reach a consumer, when the creditor actions used the best information on hand.  	0

"There should be clear guidelines on what constitutes ""irrelevant and frivolous"". In my own experience, the CRA's consistently refused to delete trade lines not belonging to me even when I had provided documentation from the original creditor validating the debt was not mine. They falsely claimed they received additional information from the original creditor that superseded the documentation I had. When I circled back to the original creditor, I had learned the debt was sold to a junk debt buyer which leads to a separate issue. If the junk debt buyer is reporting to a credit reporting agency, why are they misrepresenting themselves as the original creditor. Junk Debt buying should be prohibited all together. The original creditors should know their vendors just as the law mandates they know their customers. If the vendor is violating the law on the original creditor's behalf the original creditor should hold responsibility to some extent.  "	1
I would like to add another aspect, which is that we talk about Europe, we want to be European, we are 27 countries and therefore we must first agree among ourselves. We must first create a basis between us so that these laws are created at the European level. And then we would have more strength. For example, identity card: in our country everyone has an identity card, in the United Kingdom it doesn't even exist. So we don't know how many people there are, how many illegals. We don't even know anymore, how many legal, illegal there are in a certain country and so at that point we don't know how to intervene, so we have to agree, we have to be convinced of the same policy.	0
"While exercising your ability to read manuals and use Google is educational and, in this area, likely a worthwhile investment in the modern world, it is generally not what users are after. Personally, when choosing between two programs I don't give ""requires extensive learning"" a significant positive weight. As for performance, I've found that mostly to be an aspect of more minimalistic setups, which require more experience to set up and run. In short, the benefits you list do exist, but they are all very long-term; in the short-term, there are plenty of obstacles such as needing to find replacements for programs one uses, or setting up wine, or configuring Xorg. Many common operations, such as syncing with an iPhone, are not officially supported. Flash is still not exactly perfect. The situation is getting better, but expecting people to move without becoming less productive for at least a few weeks is unreasonable.

"I would like to react to what Peter said. That is, he would be in favor of a kind of selective immigration.

And that doesn't sound good to me. Because as Herold said earlier, the migration flow, there are always migration flows. People are always looking for better conditions.

So as it comes to immigration or emigration, I suppose, I think that we should define some criteria in order to enter a country. I think, however, that the criteria should be based on the European level, because these are our common boarders. Appropriate criteria should be established to enter the European territory. Of course, the debate should be conducted within the countries from which the immigrants come from. Criteria are very important. For example the criteria for economic refugees and political refugees differ enormously. That is how I would like to complement previous statements. 	0
Payment processor Visa has general information and the corresponding state statutes about the 10 states that prohibit companies from charging credit/debit card fees located on their website. Texas, which most people would think would be business friendly, is actually really consumer friendly when it comes to these fees, for example. Texas has had a long-standing state law against credit card fees, and just recently this year created a new state law to cover against debit card fees and other stored value cards (like prepaid debit cards).     And, no, I do not have any knowledge of if debt collectors are charging debtors payment processing fees or not, but if they are--especially in the states that forbid this practice--they should not be allowed to do so. And I further believe that in the remaining states that do not have any laws forbidding credit/debit cards surcharges, that a fed reg/law should forbid debt collectors in all states from doing so.  	0
Someone keeps calling for a person named Sean, who does not live here and I don't know anyone by that name. I tell them they have the wrong number, but they continue to call. They sometimes leave canned messages on my answering machine. I realize some debtors pretend not to be at the number being called, but these collectors need to verify the information so they don't keep calling the wrong number. I don't know if the debtor gave the wrong number intentionally, or this number was used by someone else before I got it. It is extremely irritating. And even though the callers do not say they are debt collectors, it is obvious.  	1

Thank you for the question. It is difficult to get access to some figures, but I have official figures from Germany. It is not politically correct to talk about crime in Germany in this circle, but 15 million immigrants came to Germany legally - without qualifications 44 percent, without professional qualifications between 22 and 40 years: 44 percent, and without professional qualifications from Turkey: 72 percent. So, when you compare for example the immigration to Australia. If I want to immigrate to Australia, I have to have a lot of money, I have to prove that I have an employer in Australia. So maybe we should see what happens outside Europe, how immigration is managed outside Europe. Thank you.	1

I think those subjects lend themselves well to not having to study much for exams because foundational concepts are taught as the building blocks for more complex material. It seems that classes where early information isn't regularly referenced in later material (or logically connected somehow) would take longer to study for, since the material is easier to forget.	0
And how do you propose to pay for all of this? Sure it's a noble effort that you want to get everyone the help they deserve but this would be a massive effort and require the funding and man power to back it up. Also people have lies where they are, who is to say that you may relocate someone who just recently became homeless and is looking to get bak on their feet. Also you assume that all homeless don't have jobs. I've met quite a few who do work all day and struggle after because they cannot afford housing because they simply do not make enough money.	1
Collectors should be barred from stating that payment of a debt will definitively improve a consumers credit score as FICO (the industry standard) uses proprietary algorithm that the collection agent cannot possibly guess at. Yes, a collection agent, in good faith negotiation for resolution of the alleged debt should be able to remove the collection trade line from the consumers credit reports which should be stipulated in a binding settlement agreement signed by both parties.  	0
Jeffreyjon, it sounds like you are identifying how a strategic defaulter acts. However, Involuntary Defaulters don't have the income available to pay down a debt if the interest rate charges are going to keep accruing.  	0
I often find that some banks wont allow their agencies to take debit or credit card. All agencies should accept debit and credit payments. Its like they are stuck in 1950.  	1
that wouldn't be very efficient. The FCRA does not allow reporting of a debt that is no longer being serviced by a creditor/collector. For example, if your creditor is currently reporting the debt but sells it to a debt collector, your creditor can no longer report on that debt. The buyer can, if he subjects himself to the corresponding federal regulation.  	0
The question I have with all this is that we are talking about democracies and countries and I'm not sure, if you can impose a democracy on a country when you are an outside country - even when you are Europe. Every time someone has tried to impose a democracy, it has ended in wars and that is not the reason why countries have recovered their democracy. So I don't know to what extent we can really influence this side. People have to ask for democracy inside the country themselves.	1
So I think education is an issue anyway; but is not to be discussed here at the moment. What is clear is that fewer and fewer young people are entering the professions, that we have fewer and fewer gainfully employed people - even qualified gainfully employed people. We have a differentiation between the low-wage sector and qualified skilled workers and I think we can all say that in the qualified sector we need people from all over the world in order to be able to cover the jobs here at all and I think - perhaps I speak for myself - the fear of losing one's job - if we ourselves cannot cover these jobs, then no one is afraid of someone coming from abroad to fill these places, so that the companies continue to live, so that the other jobs are also secured - I think there the migration we all agree - are all of the opinion, the people should come here and they should be allowed to stay, with families - if they want it then.	0
1) ALL of the buildings in the complex were damaged by massive buildings falling on them, building 7 just got the worst of it. IIRC, building 7 fell about an hour after 1 and 2, and firefighters had already evacuated because they could tell it was on the verge of collapse. 2) If you watch video of the towers falling, you can see they started at where the planes hit. There were several stories above where the planes hit, so that's a lot of weight falling at once onto the rest of the building, which caused a chain reaction of each floor falling into the next. The building wasn't built for that kind of stress, which caused the whole thing to collapse pretty quickly. As far as the cut beams you were talking about, there were only a few of them, and truthers cherry picked them out. 3) When the towers fell, each floor sandwitched into the next. There's a lot of air in between each floor, and it has to go somewhere. the easiest escape out is weakened windows (the explosions coming out of windows some truthers like to point out) or down the stairwell, which ended in the basement. I never heard about a burned janitor, but that air coming into the basement would be really hot. 4) Thermite is just a mixture of a metal powder and a oxidizer, typically aluminum and iron oxide. You don't need a chemical reaction to make it, just to physically mix it (mythbusters made a bunch by putting the two powders in a cement mixer). You'd find a lot of that stuff mixed together when 2 100+ story buildings collapse. In addition to that, an inside job would require weeks of work, including cutting away walls to wrap the support beams with explosives or thermite (which unless channeled, only burns down btw). Many of the over 30,000 people that worked there every day must have noticed that, but no one did.	0
I think that it was only about persons here who come from outside of Europe. We do not talk about the immigration inside Europe, as there is a free movement of persons, so those quotas we talked about would not be reasoned. One needs to take a closer look at the conditions upon which people decide to come to Europe, but there is no need to impose any quotas because we would need to turn someone down, but there would be a necessity for those people to come, however they would not be in the ballpark of quota.  	0
The Country should help but should also not allow a too big amount of immigrants to come because in the end there is going to be too many of them, a too big labour force. Most of them will sleep in the tents because there will not be enough money to put them all in a good condition. Because it is not the best idea to take them all and to give them nothing. Thank you.	0
The quotas system should be set according to the budget of each state. For example, when the state has a large inflow of immigrants, the EU should give more money and assist certain country and its immigrants.	0
Yes, I wanted to say in terms of integration, exactly where I live in the neighborhood, there are people who came from Russia and in all my life I have never seen people as brave as them. So they come to work with us, they learn the language, they integrate into our system; they are always very courageous in their work and they adapt very well. A little further away, there is a city, and there, there are a lot of foreigners. A few years ago, these foreigners really wanted to barricade their ghetto area. These people were separating themselves from the others, going it alone, in a ghetto form, so to speak, and in the meantime, it's settled. So, I don't make any distinction between the legal, illegal aspect of immigration. I believe that as long as people respect our laws, our culture, our - our religions, the fact that they go to work and put their kids in school, then I believe that they should be guaranteed to stay. Another little experience from my early youth: I had a Turkish friend and her parents don't like us to go out and I think that's a bit strong.	1
When it comes to assimilation within the EU, whether we talk about economic, or any other immigrants, if their culture and roots are similar, the integration will not be so hard at all. However, when one has a different cultural background, the assimilation is not easy. Or in other words, I could say that one can promote assimilation of people with similar cultural backgrounds, and it seems to me that the chances will be much bigger than chances of people with different cultural backgrounds. 	0
The EU is a bloated apparatus in which democracy is absolutely zero. In Brussels, the commissioners are appointed for life, like the pope, and for me there is nothing at all about democracy; you can vote once every five years, make a cross, by deputies, where you don't know any old sow - and that's the EU. I don't think that's so great.	0
I think that they can even integrate and continue to speak their language among themselves. Because if you take away their cultural roots, I have two perfect examples here. I have two perfect examples here, one Polish, recently arrived and one who has been here for a long time and I see that they speak perfectly Polish, but that doesn't prevent them from speaking French very well too. I think we can have, the human brain can speak several languages. We are in a good position here to... I think that they have to integrate by speaking the language, but I understand what you mean. But between them I think it's natural that they continue to speak in their language of origin anyway, right? Well, I don't know, that's my opinion.	0
It's true that France has taken in a lot of people. This is also due to the fact that France has always had many colonies, and these people have always liked to visit their motherland, their homeland. So in Germany we didn't have this phenomenon, we had only a few small colonies that we already lost in the last century. So after the Second World War, which we lost - you all know, Germany was really about, Germany suffered, so I don't want to put us on a stall, not even talking about all the money we had to pay to foreign countries, but finally right away, Germany recovered already in the flashy years, We were able to live a first economic boom and we welcomed the first immigrants, it was mainly Italians in a first phase, then Spaniards, Portuguese, then Austrians, there were less certainly therefore from the flashy years, sixty in any case and they were welcome besides. Then, for a while, fewer people came, and then the Turks arrived en masse, but it was the Anatolian plateau that was recreated in Germany, and at that time, of course, the first Beurs, the first Hungarians, were born, and at that time we really had to begin to create this balance in society - we could compare it with the wave of Algerians who arrived in France, but well - we mustn't deviate too much from the subject, So we have to discuss among ourselves how we can welcome people in our country or how we can really ensure the existence of these people who arrive in our country in the short and medium term, or even until 2030, and then we have to distinguish once again between the legal and the illegal, as was said at the beginning. I would even go one step further and say that all those who want to come from Africa, for example, to our country now - for example Lampedusa, the Italian island which is almost overpopulated by Africans - how can we address these people? How can we tell them: we want to welcome you but not like this? These are not the right conditions. Now we don't have the possibilities.	1
In that case, Slovenia is a very specific country because is the most developed part of Post-Yugoslavia. At some point there was an influx of immigrants. At the moment, we are a member of the EU and we have many seasonal workers, which are coming to our country but when the seasonal work is over then they are coming back to their countries. We have as well students which are coming to Slovenia. Sometimes, they stay there, but most of them come back to their own countries. 	1
"I don't think ""ending the R-word"" is a worthwhile goal. CMV. For those who are unfamiliar with the campaigns to ""end the R-word,"" it is essentially a movement to stop the use of the word ""retarded"" being used as an insult or as a casual descriptor for something being dumb. The reasons for this are that it is insulting to those who actually have mental disabilities. The reasons I don't think this goal is worthwhile are threefold: * I do not see it as being any different from calling someone blind, deaf, or lame. It is simply another disability that is used to exaggerate a situation. ""How did you not see that huge sign? Are you blind?"" Acceptable. ""How did you not hear that car horn blaring at you? Are you deaf?"" Acceptable. ""How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?"" Unacceptable. My theory for *why* this is the case is that people see mental retardation as more integral to who people are. If you imply that being blind is bad, that's ok, that's obvious and blind people are more than their disability; they are a person *with* a disability. If you imply that being mentally retarded is bad, you are directly insulting and belittling retarded people. I would argue that this mentality has the negative effect of us further stigmatizing mentally retarded individuals by forcing us to see the disability and the person as one in the same. * People are not going to stop using this word. Oftentimes people compare this campaign with efforts to end the use of the word ""gay"" to casually describe something as being dumb. It is undeniable that mainstream use of that word has decreased in recent years, partially due to similar campaigns. However, the difference is that there is no inherent disadvantage to being gay; the only reason homosexuals are disadvantaged is because of society, and as society's opinions changed on gay persons, it made less sense to use that descriptor in a negative way. Retardation, on the other hand, is inherently disadvantageous and entails lower measures on intelligence tests and self-sufficiency, much like being blind or deaf are disadvantageous. While in the future we may see nearly no prejudice against gays, it will never seem weird to consider mental retardation as being disadvantageous and negative. * The casual use of the word retarded came about due to its initial designation as a clinical descriptor for those with mental disabilities. Even if we were to somehow end the casual use of the word, it would simply be replaced by whatever the new clinical term is. As I stated, people will continue to draw a comparison to this disability, which is defined by lower intelligence, when describing things and actions that are defined by their lack of intelligence. So there you have it. Hopefully you can change my view and help me see why we should be putting forth the time and effort to ""end the R-word."" Thanks, guys. **TL;DR I do not think that ending the R-word is a worthwhile goal because it is no different from casually calling someone deaf or blind, people will continue to use this term because retardation is inherently a disadvantage, and even if the campaign works, people would just start using the new clinical term. Also, by making the rules different for retardation than deafness or blindness, it implies that retarded people *are* their disability instead of affected by it. CMV.** Edit: /u/Shadygaga and /u/jwhitx changed my view! I'm enjoying this conversation, though, so I'd still love to see what you all have to say. Edit 2: /u/OctopusPirate shifted my view back to my initial position by [rebutting the points made by the previously mentioned users]( This conversation has given me a lot to think about, though."	0

It seems like a core assumption in your argument (correct me if this is wrong) is that people will have only one relationship in their lifetimes. This is in fact wildly inaccurate, and many people will find love 2, 3, or even 10 or more times in their lives. As such, it's certainly possible, even if there are wildly unequal numbers of men and women, for all of them to find love at some point in their lives. Imagine, for example, a society with 100 men and 20 women. If those women have an average of 5 or more relationships in their lives, it's definitely possible for all 100 of those men to find love at least once in theirs. &gt;Edit 1: take a look at R4R, for any given female, her post it's more likely to have 5 or more replies than a male one, which in average will have 1 or 2 replies, if he is lucky, of course that isn't a rule, because female more likely will send a private message than a public post, still it shows something. R4R is a terrible example, because Reddit is nowhere near representative of the entire world when it comes to ratio of men to women. Your stats put it at somewhere around 2.177/2.113, but on Reddit it's more like 3/1 if memory serves.	0
I would disagree that there is confusion among consumers about SOL which would, as you suggest, require the need for a national SOL. The only time I have personally seen SOL straddle a line is when a consumer moves to another state with a different SOL. The clarity needs to be in these such cases. Because once a debtor moves, both parties claim the SOL where it benefits them for their desired outcome. A national SOL only benefits the debt collectors and not the consumers. The focus should remain on creating, as best as possible, a win-win solution that benefits the debt collectors the consumers. Having a national SOL of 7 years as ACA International wants compromises state laws wherein some states of SOL of 3 years (and otherwise less than 7). A SOL is meant to bring resolve. And in reality, if a debt collector/debt owner can not resolve their clients issues within the already established SOL of each state, then extending the SOL or having a national SOL under which to bring suit does nothing but allow debt collectors to continue to harass consumers. Three years really is more than enough time to sue. Just as criminal defendants are entitled to a quick and speedy trail, so should consumers who may/may not be aware they have an outstanding debt. That is to say: having a national SOL is a guise to prolong resolution rather than a more quick a final resolve in when to bring suit.  	1
Minors should have an opportunity to vote. CMV. I think that individuals who are under 18 should be eligible to vote provided they pass a test that would demonstrate they have clear understanding and knowledge of political issues. Minors that are willing to make the extra effort of taking a test (that citizens over 18 don't do) should be able to vote as their vote would be just as valid and educated as adult citizens.	0
What it's basically about now, I don't know either. I wanted to know how one can work out a visa. I didn't read anything about it in the brochure or I read over it, I don't know. But I don't know why you can't get a visa to continue working. And whether the one who is here illegally now has no more visa. Whether he will get a job at all. That is the question. I either read over that or I didn't read that, I'm not informed on that.	0
"I am currently going through a miserable experience with a creditor and debt collector. In 2004 I completed my college education and consolidated all of my student loans through Nelnet. In 2005 (or so) I started to get calls from debt collectors stating that I was delinquent on my loan repayment. I explained the situation, that I had made all of my timely payments through Nelnet and, before I would pay anything else, I would need to see some proof of the debt. I never received any proof of the debt and this conversation reoccurred several times for the next five years. In 2011 I wanted to buy my (wife""s) dream home. It was a significant purchase and the bankers I talked with indicated I needed to clear up the student loan issue to be approved. I reached out to the original creditor and the debt collector and begged for some proof of the loan. They then provided me with a loan application (nothing to indicate that the application was approved or that any funds were ever dispersed to me). While I was not comfortable with the proof, I knew that fighting it out in court would take longer than I was willing to take. So, I was very purposeful in my conversations with the original creditor and the debt collector to make sure that the issue would be cleared on my credit report if I paid the full value of the (alleged) loan. I also recorded the conversations I had with the original creditor and the debt collector. I paid the original loan amount and (if you didn't see this coming) the original creditor refused to update my credit report. And, even after providing the credit reporting agencies with proof that the debt was paid, they also refused to update my credit report. To make matters worse, after the debt was paid, I received a notice from the debt collector that several thousands of dollars had been excused. I immediately contacted the debt collector and requested documentation that would support their amount due, including documentation where I agreed to a specific interest rate. No response from the debt collector. So, I am now arguing it out with the IRS regarding any additional taxes that may be due. And, even though I paid the debt two years ago, my credit report has not yet been updated. It is simply ridiculous than any business would have this much power to have such a negative impact on an individual without any documentation to back it up. Any creditor should be required to provide certain documentation prior to making a negative credit reporting and there should be significant consequences for any creditor/debt collector that pursues a debt without having the required documentation.

I don't think you'll find hard evidence that it's set *at birth*, but there is tremendous evidence that genetics play a big role. The most popular piece of evidence is a study done on twins. Identical twins are much more likely to be gay if the other one is gay than fraternal twins -- and the trend holds up even when identical twins are separated at birth. This controls for environmental factors extremely well and shows that their genetics do have a huge component to play in their sexuality. Source:	0
Maybe I will give an example here. So everyone gets sentimental about these illegal immigrants. To Poland came in a certain period a whole bunch of Gypsies in order to gather on the streets. We had permanent whole pageants of beggars. So what we had to do, leave them at the mercy of fate, pat them, or what? So they were expelled to Romania. They came to Poland just for begging, so in such cases we must say no and be strict. Thank you.	1
In the case of Poland, the number of immigrants has not changed after the EU accession. I guess there is still the same number of immigrants. According to what my previous speaker[NK] said, immigrants are coming because there are jobs that Polish people do not want to take (special jobs), so the immigrants are coming and overtaking them in my country. Also, many immigrants in Poland trade, especially people from Vietnam and the countries where you can get cheap clothes.	1
"Most of the consumer debt I see if coming from debt buyers and the consumer doesn't recognize the name or the amount. Many of these are beyond the statute of limitations to file suit but suit is filed anyway. Many consumers don't know to file an answer is court and a default judgment is entered. The information you suggest would help a lot in letting consumers know what this debt is. I would include the trail of ownership of the debt as there could be intermediary owners between the original creditor and final collector. Debts are sold and resold. It would also help to have some documentation of the specific debt having been sold so the consumer can verify the current ownership of the debt. Currently, all they get in response to a validation request is ""we checked and you owe it"". Our firm asks for specific documents related to the claimed debt and the response we get is ""the courts say we don't have to provide any documents...go fish"".  "	1
People get fired for personal calls at work. I worked at a place where employee phone call was recorded and randomly monitored due to the sensitivity of our work. And every now and then an employee would get caught making/taking a personal phone call and would be fired with no questions asked. Work is not the place for personal business.  	1
When debt collectors send that Validation Notice, they are required to state the creditor to whom the debt is owed. I think that is sufficient notice that the debt is being assigned for collection. I commented on the other thread that I DO believe notice should be given when the debt is sold. But if the current creditor is retaining ownership but just assigning it to a collection agency or law firm, they will be notified when that agency contacts them and sends a Validation Notice. Besides, the collection agency or law firm may end up refusing to accept the account due to a conflict or a variety of other reasons. Giving notice that ends up being false would certainly cause confusion.  	0
I think the only currently available way to get rid of HIV/AIDs is to start quarantining people who have the disease. CMV. [Quarantine]( Edit Note: I do not think people with AIDS should be quarantined in the traditional sense (I.e. Isolated from the community). Im thinking more along the lines of a voluntary online database, perhaps one that could only be accessed if the person with AIDS told you to check it. Something like this: * person A finds out he/she has AIDS * Person A then registers on this database, and informs his/her previous sexual partners. These people are sent a message with login information. * this could lead to people getting themselves checked out, and could lead to more people registering, informing their sexual partners, etc. I'm not sure of the logistics or how this would work out, but basically I think that people who have the disease HIV/AIDS need to be quarantined, added to a registry, or something like that so that they stop spreading the disease. We've spent Billions on AIDs research, but the current pharmaceutical technology we have isn't sophisticated enough to eradicate this disease. In the mean time, quarantining is the only other option we have. I know there could be a lot of social stigma around people who were quarantined, but I don't think it has to be that invasive (privacy wise). People with AIDS could be entered into a database that people without AIDS could check prior to engaging in sexual relations or the sharing of needles. That way, you (hopefully) wouldn't be discriminated against if you were buying a house, applying for a job, etc. I'll be back in a few hours. Thanks /r/changemyview! Edit: Thanks everyone! While I was definitely on the fence about this, the information presented here was excellent and definitely changed my view!	0
The original creditor has information about the debtor's language; ii) The collector obtains information about the debtor's language; *or* iii) The debtor lives in a ZIP code known to have a significant (5%?) number of non-English speakers. This requirement should only apply to languages with large LEP populations - a threshold might be 100,000 - to avoid undue cost. For smaller populations, where obtaining a full translation might be uneconomical, collectors could include the following passage translated into the appropriate languages on an otherwise English letter:  	0
Debt collectors file a large number of default judgments because quite simply consumers do not take action, not because they are unaware of the issue. Usually at the time a lawsuit is filed, a debt collector has attempted to resolve the issue via telephone calls and/or letters. This doesn't even include the efforts the original creditor may have made. A lawsuit is never a first response. It is usually done after numerous and repeated failed efforts to work with a consumer to resolve an outstanding debt. A default judgment is just a further extension of that. Even after we file suit, we may attempt to reach the consumer to resolve the lawsuit prior to judgment being taken. I have seen numerous files where we have spoken to the consumer and told them they can file an answer, and they still don't. In my opinion, default judgments are largely the result of consumer's deliberate uninvolvement with the process, rather than a collector taking deceptive steps. I will state that many states have local rules that if there is no response to a summons and the consumer has defaulted, they do not need to be noticed on a motion for a default judgment. Therefore, the actual entry of the judgment may in fact come as a surprise, despite the summons stating if you don't answer a judgment may be taken. However, an attorney who follows the local rules is not acting deceptively. In order to curb this shock for the consumer who doesn't answer, it wouldn't be bad to require all motions for judgment be served upon the consumer, despite local rules which may require otherwise. I would point out, many default judgment motions are not noticed for motion hour. They may simply be submitted for a ruling without a court hearing. As to the inquiry as to what is required to support a default judgment, this varies court to court and judge to judge. The courts that I have seen require more documentation are largely looking for affidavits of debt, charge off statements and statement showing payments or charges, and the assignment (if the plaintiff is a debt buyer).  	1

Yes, a problem, or an observation of mine in Germany. In our country, in the political discussion, it is never mentioned and openly mentioned how relatively more often foreigners are susceptible to punishment. That is not politically correct. If figures are now published in our country, they are not politically desirable. This is in line with political correctness. In this respect, it is very difficult to have a discussion, because many things are suppressed in our country, also from the point of view of knowledge.	0
The CFPB should ban workplace calls completely. Consumers provided a home phone number when they take on the debt and that should be the number they call to collect it. Communicating by registered/certified letter should also be the alternate method not workplace calls. Second Massachusetts limiting the total number of calls is a fabulous idea. We don't throw debtors in prison today yet the ridiculous amount of abuse and scorn they must endure is totally unacceptable. CFPB desperately needs to clean up the debt collection industry.  	0
I used to have a lot of debt and told every single company that called to send me something in the mail. I paid every single debt that I received mail for. Years later someone went after me and me, not knowing the rules, got stuck with it.

As a mortgage lender for an FDIC-insured bank, I'm astounded at the number of customers who sit across from me and are wholly dumbfounded when I tell them their loan request is denied because of outstanding collections. For certain there are some people who knew full well they would have collections items and are playing dumb (and not doing so very well). But many of them had no clue, and 90% of those collections are medical in nature. If the CFPB truly is about protecting the interests of the consumer, then the debt collection process needs to be simplified drastically in regard to collection items (medical, utilities, etc.). after 60 days of non-payment, the account can be closed. The creditor sends a certified letter to the last known address of the debtor, informing them they have 30 days to bring the account current or make other payment arrangements, or the account will be turned over to a collection agency. Said letter also needs to contain the contact information for that collection agency, so they know in advance who to contact if they don't respond within 30 days. Yes, a lot of those letters will be returned undeliverable or will end up in someone else's hands. But that would demonstrate a good faith effort by the creditors to work with the debtors before passing the buck to a collection agency. The added benefit for the government is the increase in certified letters passing through the USPS!  	0
On the other hand, what you say is that the country that receives an immigrant must lower its pants a little and say yes, and everything that is asked of it, but that I do not understand. Spain receives many thousands of immigrants, opens its doors, its churches, opens the doors of its schools. And these immigrants do not adapt to the local customs. But if I send my daughter to a religious school, I know that there are certainly rules. If I take her to a school that is not religious, I know there are other rules. Well, it doesn't matter if so-and-so wears the veil or not, in the end it's a custom, it's kind of like if I wear jeans or something else. It doesn't matter. Now, if I go to a religious school, there is a cross. That's it, it's a religious school and that's the way it is. If you are not happy, you leave that school. That's what I think. But I am not against immigration in itself.	1
Partial payments should NOT revive the debt. The original lender or the agencies working on their behalf have more than reasonable time to collect on an outstanding amount owed. We have rules in place on both collecting debts and on reporting them and partial payment on a debt should not circumvent those rules.  	0
CMV: I believe that the fuel economy benefits offered by hybrid cars is a myth due to a basic understanding of physics. It is my view that the fuel efficiency of hybrid cars is an absolute myth and that this view can be supported by a very basic understanding of physics. Note that I exclude plug-in cars from this statement. The manufacturers of hybrid cars make huge claims of offering fantastic gas milage due to their hybrid technology. Their argument is that as the car has a second electric engine, it can run around without using any gas what-so-ever at low speed and for short distances. They state that the gas engine will only kick in when the extra power is needed. This combination of gas and electric leads to the most efficient possible method to build a vehicle. I would counter this view with the following three key points: 1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking). 2 - Therefore, whenever a hybrid car is driven anywhere at any speed, on gas or electric power, it is carrying the weight of all of these components. 3 - A basic understanding of physics tells us that it is physically impossible to get more energy out of something than was put into it. When we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth. I reach the conclusion that the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there. It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. It is my contention that hybrid cars are developed to sell as a marketing pitch, and that in actual fact a straight up efficient gas car is a much more logical and efficient way to achieve good levels of economy.	0
Information about the source of the debt (such as the date of the service) can be provided without infringing on the patient's privacy. No one should be asked to pay a debt without first being told why they owe the money. This is esp. true of medical debts, which are notoriously complex and apparently redundant, with many charges occurring on the same occasion.  	0
"How do you get the basis for that? So how do you sell the ideas so credibly that people say, ""We support these countries, we have enough money for it, we don't have enough problems of our own."" Because so much money has already seeped away, how are we going to claim now, in the future this won't happen. We don't have the successes yet, we concentrate a lot of money in Europe - in Brussels for all I care - and people don't see the money. The money is moving away from the country and people are just afraid that it's just gone and I just think the credibility is not there with that yet. So I just think you can't find a base of support for that in your own country."	0
I think there is a difference here between the history of European countries. For example, if we help the producers of African bananas, the French government will say that it competes with bananas from Martinique, which curiously enough is part of Europe, so it's further away than the Ivory Coast, but... and we can see the role of the colonies, which no longer have their names and others that have become departments. Finally, the principle is always the same. And everyone agrees to regulate, to put rules for the market on condition that they do not respect it. Worn at this time, bananas is for France but I am sure that for other countries other products. Unfortunately, this is what the Chinese and others are doing, but Europe still has difficulty speaking with one voice because there are often interested parties, unfortunately contradictory. [1 :	0
I would like something that addresses the amount of times a debt collector can contact someone other than the debtor. My husband's exwife has several debts and we are sometimes contacted several times a day and often at night to find out if we are in contact with her they have been divorced 36 years  	1
I am on a Senior plan for my mobile phone and I get charged for each text that comes in or goes out. I am able to make/receive texts, but have to pay for each one ... so it is not fair to make me pay extra on top of what I already owe. I am against using cell phones for business advertisements or debt collecting texts or calls.  	1
"Many states have a judgement law where a consumer with over a certain amount of judgements may be terminated from employment. Having a collector call at work just seems to be another way to break down a consumer and put them at a disadvantage. A friend has mentioned to me receiving collection calls at work for one of his employees where the collector identified himself as ""Officer"" My friend told the collector never to call again and that it's illegal to impersonate law enforcement. Too many other stories that went to court for FDCPA violations of collector harassment at work even when the employer has told the collector not to call there again.  "	1
In my opinion, if they take the risk here in Europe, if they take the risk that they will be sent back, that's my opinion. And well, it's on their own account. So obviously, they don't have any money. So they still have to be sent back, I think. As much as they are illegal, they have to be sent back too. And nothing more to allow them to live here, if they don't have a house, if they don't have a job, in the end it's still the European community that has to pay the costs.	0
On this subject, I can only say that both are true. In the case of some of these young immigrants - surveys have been conducted in our country - one can say that the following was striking: Young female immigrants in the age range from 15 to 30, I would say, have a completely different attitude toward integration into the welfare state; they learn the German language, they know the German language - then you come back to the conclusion that because they know it, they have a better education, better training opportunities. And the male young people from these countries - that is striking - they have a different circle of interests. This has become a subculture, it has formed and it is there - they are not interested in learning the language and they are not interested in integrating. So this problem, the state won't be able to solve it and the EU won't be able to solve it either; it's up to the individuals themselves, so there are bound to be problems, there always will be. But I agree with that, so the language is quite important in that direction.	1
Maybe these people are here to take advantage of social laws, maybe that's true but maybe also how - maybe they only have that opportunity. Are they given enough jobs, are they given enough training so that they can have a job that is their level and a proper way of life? So, it is sure that - well - in which direction we have to take the problem and how we have to solve it - what does the one do, what does the other do? What is the cause and what is the effect? It is very complicated. And I think that there are people who are trying to integrate, who are trying not to take advantage of the social goods that we have in our countries, but they don't have the possibility to work. And I think that's still something that's common.	0
"Give Consumers Fair Notice and A Chance to Bid on Their Own Debts When Banks Sell Defaulted Obligations to Debt Buyers When a consumer falls behind on loan or credit card payments, the bank often ""sells"" the account to a debt buying company for a few pennies on the dollar. Debt buyers contribute nothing to society. Yet, they are allowed to obtain windfall profits by pursuing impoverished consumers for the full face value of such debts. This is unfair. If a bank is going to sell a consumer""s debt for pennies on the dollar, the bank should be required to notify that consumer, and allow that consumer a fair chance to bid on and purchase his/her own debt, on terms just as favorable as the terms offered to any other debt buyer. I hope the CFPB will consider new rules in this regard. Please note there is currently a petition on the White House website for this issue at: __URL__ It was initiated here: __URL__"	0
Every validation notice should include, not only the name, but the address and phone number of the current owner of the debt. It is not always the case that the consumer knows who the owner of the debt is, or how to contact them. This would not be a burden on collection agencies, because it would only require the collection agency to cut and paste the address and phone number of the debt owner onto the validation notice. The collection agency should already have this information in their company records, as the debt collector is forwarding consumer payments to said debt owner's address. This would allow the consumer to attempt to deal with the debt owner directly to try to resolve the dispute. For example, a case of mistaken identity can more easily be resolved by talking to a customer service representative of the debt owner, than by talking to a debt collector. The debt collector has no authority to correct the mistake, but a customer service representative of the debt owner does.  	0
"I believe that modern, mass media is biased, corrupt, and is only concerned with getting views. CMV It has always seemed to me that the media is only concerned with views rather than giving it's viewers the whole truth, or any truth at all. I believe their selection bias makes people think this world is an awful place because they only choose to show the horrible/disastrous things that happen in the world. I always read stories about how some poor man's car was stolen or how two neighbors had a disagreement got in a fight yesterday, yet I hardly ever read about a that car being found and returned to it's owner or a neighbor helping another neighbor out. I believe this is because the the ""happy"" stories aren't very exciting to read and don't get very many reads or views. This is why I believe modern mass media is completely corrupt. If it makes any difference, I am from California. I would love for this not be the case, so please change my view!"	1
I have no personal experiences with debt to speak of, only my experiences working with victims of identity theft who have fraudulent debts; which is a horse of a different color. Consumers are not educated about how debt collection and revival works. The issue in the end isn't the mechanics, or if they can request the debt not be reported. The issue is that, the way things stand now, it is not clear how repaying a debt will improve their score. It is not clear that they can ask for the collector not to report the debt payment if the debt is older than seven years. Consumers are confused and have these inaccurate perceptions because things are not clear. Again, it is the perception which concerns me - it would benefit both creditors and consumers if it was plain and clear, in language the average consumer could understand, that paying off a debt is a good thing.  	1
I think that in the media, in the medium term ten years. Over the next 20, 30 years, with the population of people to be seen unemployed, and we know very well in all countries there are statistics. It is really that it is made, it has a big percentage that is young people. It is not as if with people of 50 years, at my age. There are many young people who are unemployed. So they have 30 years of work ahead of them. So people we're going to make... I think it would be better to make all these people work in their country. That they won't cover pensions, because that's a load of crap, that's another subject. But it never encourages me, it's just to say, come on, we're going to make a good gesture, we're going to bring in people, it's going to pay for the withdrawals. That's not true. It will never pay, the state always has to throw in some. But in principle, I consider that we have enough people to work in our country. Germany has to go almost to... because well, when they say 4 million unemployed it's true that I'm a little bit [...], but I know very well that it's [...]. In countries like Germany, as in our country, they say 4 million, but they have to put more because the figures are fudged. Well, I'm not talking about Spain, which should have a high unemployment rate, and Portugal too. I don't go to countries like Romania where it's... well, it's even a question of retirement, in Romania. No, you have to put all the people to work and make sure that, seen from their work, [...] not like the Middle Ages. Finally, I think that all these people who are going to evolve in society, thanks to Europe, perhaps with countries that are emerging, that will pull them all... we already have enough to occupy ourselves without having immigration to come. I stand by my decisions. I'm stubborn but, there you go. And I don't need Tunisian children to pay for my retirement. I have my children, I have three daughters. They will not pay [...] the jobs. I can do 15 to pay for my retirement.  [Gelächter]	1
I think this is a problem of a long-term policy. Let’s say that it comes to certain disasters caused by elements. More and more people and immigrants will be. So we should create some kind of frames on the EU-level that would be applied in all the countries. These rules would decide about the quotas for immigrants and under what conditions they could come here.	0
So in our country there are hardly any immigrants from Africa or from other very poor people, because these people know very well that there are nowhere near as good opportunities in our country as in Germany, so we would like to know how they deal with illegal immigration in Germany.	1
You cannot cycle or get public transport in rural areas. What you are advocating would shift all people to living in the city which is not practical or affordable for many people. I grew up in the country 30 miles from the nearest town where there is no public transportation. My family was not wealthy enough to just buy a new house in some city. We also would not have been able to keep our animals in the city. What do you propose that farmers do? You're most likely not going to be able to put a 20 acre farm anywhere that has decent public transportation. Do you consider the family farmer a company? If not, and they should not own cars, how do you expect them to transport their produce to the market? I live in a city now, and I cannot even take public transportation because they have trimmed the budget and cut all the bus lines. Cycling is not practical in the snow. There is no way I could get to work without a car. At one point, I moved somewhere with the sole purpose of not having to drive anywhere and taking public transportation everywhere, but then the line I took was cut back making it impossible for me to use public transportation. The city also had no way to enter on foot or on a bicycle. You had to be in a motor vehicle. You are also expecting companies that won't even fork over the cash to pay decent living wages or buy employees health insurance to buy cars for their employees. That is not going to happen. Wal-Mart and Papa Johns will force cash strapped communities to pay to transport their employees to work. This response isn't even taking into consideration those individuals with physical disabilities that cannot be expected to ride a bicycle to work. I'd like to know where you live if you think public transportation and cycling only would enable you to get to your desired expectations.	1
I think this is a problem that is related to races. For example, there are immigrants who have problems with Poles, but the only problem - in Poland, for example - we have only with Africans, with black-skinned people, we don't have other problems with immigrants.	1
May I then also add something? May I, yes? Thanks to Poland's accession to the European Union, we of course benefit from quite a few subsidies from the European Union's pot and that has also benefited my mother, for example, and we are very happy and very grateful for that.	1
"now I wanted to bring up Turkey and the attacks in the London Metro. For many months, the English didn't understand why Pakistani immigrant children, who were so warmly welcomed after all, and who were engineers, just attacked the Metro and killed many people. So it had nothing to do with language, or that you wouldn't study. It's about other things. Quite obviously about other things. And the English people couldn't understand how it was possible to carry out an attack in the metro here. So legal or illegal, I would like to say, well, I said it 20 years ago. 20 years ago I heard a Maghrebian. And he told another one: you are a shitty Maghrebian. I was shocked when I heard that. And this sentence still haunts me to this day. And today, strangely enough, it no longer seems so shocking to me. So earlier, when I heard this person 20 years ago who said ""you are a shitty Maghrebian"", it really shocked me, and today it is almost part of normality. That's where the problem of it all is."	1
These are all excellent suggestions but they don't address people who are incapable of paying down the interest bearing debt in a timely manner but could pay it down in a longer manner and if no more interest rate charges were accruing.  	0
The majority of the time, when a debt has been paid off, it has been paid to the client, not the collection agency. Most of that time when that debt has been paid to the client, the client neglects to report it to the agency. So the collectors continue to call on a paid debt that they have no knowledge of. It's really not the collectors fault, it is generally the client's.  	0
Grades aren't supposed to translate into real-world experience! That's why you should pursue internships, join clubs, participate in social activities, be a leader and blaze your own trail. High grades are valuable in telling employers that you could be a focused, diligent, quick-learning, and capable worker. A 4.0 student might learn quickly or retain information well, and that is important. But what matters is what that student does with that information to be a decision maker.	0
Some of us find ourselves on the receiving end of daily (or more frequent) robo calls because we have common last names. And I do think that the debt collectors who have called me would very much like me to pay the debt even though it isn't mine.  	0
"...say to you. Muslims and Christianity, it's not such a big difference. And you can get along with a Muslim just as well. But there are also the Islamists. They are a problem. And then we have to say something else: we have had the Enlightenment in Europe. You notice that tremendously when you are in these countries. We can no longer hide behind religion. And you have to look at this again from the imperialism point of view. The Muslims hide behind their religion because they have had very bad experiences with Europe. And that still plays a very big role. Even now, when you talk to them, the Iraq war has had a terrible impact on their mentality. It is perceived as an unjust war. We see it that way, too. And what is happening in Afghanistan is not necessarily a just war. The prisons in Guantanamo, which the West had, were also a very bad example. And we already have a bit of a conflict with the Muslims, which is historically conditioned. And that, of course, still plays out with immigrants and immigrants when they have bad experiences here. There was an exhibition in Germany two years ago about how the first Turks, how they were received in Germany. I was ashamed when I saw that exhibition. It was terrible. We really treated these people as brutes. Like animals. They got one bed, which was rented to three people at a horror price. Thank God, that's over now, and all in all, we can look on the bright side. We are slowly learning to see them as people and to integrate them. And we are also making a great effort. However, this is still a path that will take time and that we must continue to pursue. But I think the main problem is that all people want to stay in their home country and also the immigrants basically do not want to leave. But in their countries there are such conditions, we don't even want to go there on vacation. And if we go off the vacation paths, as they are all beautifully prepared, into the villages, into the Präferie [Perpherie], then we see the naked misery. And the problem with these countries is not democracy or dictatorship, but that's what's called ""good governance."" And they just have terrible governments. If they go to Nigeria, that's horrible. If they're in Congo, that's horrible. If they're in Mozambique. Terrible things everywhere. And Europe should make the greatest effort, how to gain influence, that they come to a ""good government"". It must be completely non-religious, no dictatorship, no democracy, but it must be that human rights are respected there. And now the EU has to join forces to gain influence there and to build up these countries and these governments step by step. Germany has already been very involved in Uganda and you have the impression there, if you talk to the locals, it is already bearing the first fruits."	1
I think there are rules that would be generalizable. We read here that there was a possibility, of return. A Senegalese cannot be sent back to Senegal, first of all because he is not accepted over there, first. And there we must first see what we can achieve as the EU, what we cannot achieve as individual countries. I'm sure there's something to be figured out. There are different governments in the various countries that would like to profit from the labor force that illegal immigrants represent. What should we do with it, should we shove them all into prisons, we don't have room enough for that. We certainly need common rules. I say that also because everybody has different problems. That's why we can't develop a common legislation. Everybody wants to do something for their citizens and there we also want to ask what there will be some countries that don't plan to do that, to pay people to come back for that or to take some step there. And maybe they want to, the Germans are willing to do that and the Spanish are not, or vice versa, I don't know. It's all a bit complicated. Yes, so there is differentiation, that is certainly a problem, it must also be discussed, but there you should also ask yourself whether you can agree with the law. What happens in Europe, is that, should that be worked out? But I think that in Europe every country has a problem with immigration and I don't know if in some countries the problem with unemployment has already spread so much, as we know it now in Spain, but there is a situation that speaks against these assumptions, but there one sometimes tries to find a solution, which also want to counteract crime. Yes now if we of the repatriation of the other, if the European Union, if it is at all possible, receives its citizens. Good. But now we have Mauritanians, Senegalese, how much do they give you if you work here for a year? All right, that's how much you get, I'll give it to you. And then if you act like that, I'm sure you will find an agreement with the different governments that are concerned. We have, as just mentioned before, the highest unemployment in Spain, in all of Europe. And I think that there is no other country in Europe, we have 12, 15 countries that the foreigners come from with us. That probably doesn't exist anywhere else. In Germany, I once heard that there are Turks and maybe others, that's two, and we have 15 and they don't integrate. And they create their ghettos. We have so many with us, so you can't force them back at all.	1
Of course, that's not the fault of the EU, but of the individual cities themselves - the municipalities have always made mistakes there and simply want to make old neighborhoods, old districts habitable again. That's a shot that backfires, that doesn't work.	0
&gt;It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion. No, its an event upon which the hopes of an entire nation hing. Mandela is his country's Martin Luther King Jr. Imagine that instead of the 60, the US had been segregated until 1994. Blacks, Whites, Asians, and 'Natives' were segregated in schools,beaches, and even where they lived. The mostly white government would even dictate where you would live in a city based on your race. Then imagine that one day it all changed. Imagine that one of the great black leaders who had fought against segregation for 30 years was president! Mix the election of Obama with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ONE DAY. The 1994 election meant that Apartheid was ended, and there was a black president. You think African Americans were excited over Obama? This is nothing compared to the election of Mandela. So the fact that he is dying is a pretty big deal. For South Africa, they don't want a morbid update on the deterioration of a political leader. They are holding vigil for a man who represents the greatest moment in their history.	0
Well, maybe there is a solution. A specific situation, for instance plumber or painter from Poland is a self-employed person. This way, they work in Holland in a kind of legal way as an independent persons as self employed. 	1
No matter how you slice this conversation, phone calls are the biggest abuse. You can have rules and do about the time, but they are ignored. Until you or the FTC creates rules that fine these people -- and not put the burden on the consumer to sue -- this abuse will go on. I have to laugh at these querstions. You have to be putting me on. The most abusive things debt collectors do are with their phones. They block their numbers still. They use various numbers they mislead their identities. THE PROBLEM is the onus is on the hapless consumer to get legal redress. Not good enough. You need to create fines and actually impose them. That will stop this phone abuse. They call at work, always wkill have some excuse. and call after hours. Be honest, this is an outrage what these companies have done, and nobody has minded the store on them. Never should the onus be on the consumer to get this to stop. You have to find a lawyer who thinks a whopping $1,000 is worth suing over. You have rigged this system in favor of the sharks., and that is why these sleazy companies have proliferated and have grown more and more egregious in their actions. no more recorded calls. call from one number as soon as someone says stop calling, STOP. if there is any call beyond that, they get fined. Agreed, people will have to write a letter because none of these companies will admit they were told to stop calling. But they do receive the letters, which should go to a physical address and to a person, not just a vague company name. Last, stop allowing these bad companies to change their names. They get in trouble, they change their names, and go on doing terrible things under another name. Just look online at some of these companies and how many names they've gone through. The reason this got so bad is nobody has been looking out for the consumer.  	0
The problem is the needs in each country, the possibilities to receive people. It's true that we are privileged countries and that we have it easier than other European countries to receive people, but we should receive them properly.	0

I do think discrimination plays a (secondary) role, but let's leave that aside for a moment. I once read an essay on feminism (that I wish I could remember the author of to credit them) whose point was that if you care about fairness for men and women, what you should be asking yourself is not who is to blame for some perceived slights, but instead: if you were trying to make a society that's fair to men and women from scratch, how would you arrange it? For instance, your claim is that women prefer worse-paying jobs. Is this an accidental quirk of biology? My guess is that it is not. Historical forces have shaped which jobs women are more likely to go into (for instance because they have more female mentors, because it's more socially accepted, etc.), and also which jobs are better paid. Is this how it should be arranged if you were making it up from scratch? I really don't agree with a lot of feminists on a lot of issues, but I am very much in on the concept of the patriarchy as societal forces that enforce gender roles, that often are detrimental to both men and women. I think that is what is at play here.	1
If I have understood correctly, the European policy in African countries, for example, consists in attracting the best elements, that is to say engineers and doctors, because they are needed. That's the goal. That is to say, already they are not much, we are going to plunder them the human maturity constituted by the best elements. That's it. And if they don't speak French or English, that's even better. Yes. That's what I can say, and then we're surprised that the mass author, who can't speak by any means, tries to come to Europe.	0
"Unless an animal clearly doesn't enjoy what's happening, I believe bestiality should not be morally frowned upon. I've searched and found no good arguments, so CMV (read the first sentence before you downvote) **Before you downvote, please be aware that I have searched this subreddit on the subject of bestiality before, and every single submission has been downvoted to oblivion, yet there are no good, logical, rational arguments that make a good attempt at changing somebody's view on the subject material (considering the thread may have 6 points, 18 upvotes and 12 downvotes, and its top comment may only have 3 points, with like 9 upvotes and 6 downvotes)** I would like to address a couple of arguments though. The issue of **""consent.""** But I believe that animals are in a position to be able to respond back and clearly show whether they're uncomfortable when you're doing something, or not. Animals are not bound by law (consciously anyways) to refrain from attacking you, getting frustrated, annoyed, or anything, if you were to take them out of their comfort zone. So I believe unless an animal's behavior implies ""no,"" that it should be acceptable, and if somebody continues to have sex with an animal who implies ""no,"" it will be obvious from signs of trauma stemming from the animal, and should be classified under animal abuse. There's also an argument I heard, **""They don't have a conscious grasp of sex, so that means they can not consent, meaning it's not okay!""** I am of the belief that, as long as it is not harming the animal, whether an animal knows what you're doing or not is completely irrelevant. I personally do not practice bestiality, nor do I want to, nor have I ever wanted to. But to me, it just doesn't seem like a bad thing. I feel like bestiality is only frowned upon because society hates taboos, ESPECIALLY sexual taboos. So please. Change my view. I'm not set-in-stone on this opinion. I just feel I have not been adequately given enough reasons to change it."	1
I think that we should create - well this problem of selectivity we didn't talk about earlier because we were very [...] of the chosen migration and in fact I think that we should create commissions that mix [? We could very well create commissions somewhere in Europe or in each country that would manage and take on a case by case basis or at least create criteria for adapting the possibilities of adaptation of people in a country and to know that it is indeed [...] that we accept those who come to our country. We did not talk about it earlier with the migration chosen by the governments because I think it is a little more difficult for the employees, but I think that we can do two things that can go together.	0
"Our office throws a wide net around ""disputes"". This is largely a hard one to define because it can take very specific and individual forms. Generally, however, the type of disputes we see center around when a debt buyer has purchased the debt and the consumer does not recognize the name of the debt buyer, they may generally state they don't owe the debt (with no further reasoning as to why not) or they don't owe as much as is being sought. Additionally, there may be claims of fraud or payment. Our office conservatively accepts verbal disputes as well as written. I think the greater issue is not what is considered a dispute, but how does a collector validate the debt? Many consumers ask for incredibly specific items. There is a poor form letter that floats around the internet that many consumers find and use, in which the consumer requests verification not validation, whatever the difference in that may be, then demands specific information be provided. I say this because then I believe many consumers feel each of those requested items must then be provided, when in fact the FDCPA is silent to the issue as to what proper verification is. I will leave that for another post, though my thought there will be defining what is verification will prove to be a difficult task as you can't be so defined that the various types of creditors cannot possibly provide the information sought or so loosely defined that there is load of litigation needed to define it.

"Maybe I missed something but I never received any notice from my original mortgage lender that my mortgage was sold.

I was not talking about the people who came to the country in order to beg for money. We also had such cases in Slovenia but these people have gone through a grid system (illegally). People always can bypass the law. So this theme about the legal and illegal immigration, I mean, legal immigration is always a chance, but maybe when we give them permission we can prevent such problems. I am not saying that we should prefer immigrants, be gender to immigrants, because such people will not stay in this country forever.	0

According to what this lady was saying about the Holocaust. I know very well its entire course. I graduated in history. What I mean is that it was a different kind of discrimination. Discrimination of avowed religious people. How can we accept religion with democracy where all the people should have equal rights: to vote; to assume any outfit, to our own mindedness? For example, women in Islam are devoid of that. They need to cover their faces when they go out on the streets. These women can not fully use their rights. Sometimes they can not even go to school. I really do not know how to combine it with the European system of democracy. In my concept of democracy, these two options are mutually exclusive. The woman’s role scares me the most.	1
09 :05 ] On this subject, I agree with the fact that the European Union is the entity that dictates the minimum rules. Now, obviously, we need to attract consensus. The consensus must last for a certain number of years. Some governments, because finally, if the countries of origin are as electoralist as in our countries, they have elections. And so the same thing can happen from elsewhere. It is necessary to mark the basic principles and to follow these principles in a certain time. Finally at the end of the contact [?] everything is a little bit tempted [?] of electoralism.	0
Old debt that is beyond the statue of limitation should indicate the original creditor in the initial contact letter. I think the collector does not know this information or they deliberately refuse to disclose it because they know that the debt has run it course through the CRA's for seven years. So why is it that a collector can rename themselves as the merchant because they bought an old debt and proceed to collect and to report it to the CRA's. Once your credit has taken a hit the debt collector should not be able to continually harass you for the rest of your existence. Portfolio Recovery is the culprit and they should not be able to look at your credit report and send letters to collect as if you entered into a legal and binding contract with them. Why should you reactivate an old debt that is over 16 years old. Everyone know and remember the hard patches in their lives, such as medical issues, divorces, death etc. Once the fear of being sued is removed, the chances of a collector to collect is very minute. So it becomes time consuming and it cost money to send a certified letter to ask them to validate an alleged debt. If the collector can not validate a debt then they should not continually sell and resell such debt. And there is a problem with the CRA's because it seems to me they are in cahoots with each other. If there si not any active business with a particular account on a credit report, then the CRA's should make the collector prove that a debt is valid.  	0
In Belgium, at the moment, they are tracking down sham marriages. To try to establish foreigners permanently in Belgium. It's really a hunt, because there are many sham marriages that are not declared directly, and then you have to do what is necessary to get divorced and not stay.

I summarize the situation of everything that has been said about Africa, is that in fact when we are going to intervene in a certain way but we are going to change what, a bench for the blind? It's that all the African leaders are 80 percent corrupt, so we have nothing we can do, it's always a question of economic policy, the big world firms go to Africa to remove the substance [...] evil, the leaders commit worse it will always be the same thing, there will be some for him and there was Omar Bongo in Gabon, and they are all the same. So you can never get anywhere - how can you get there then? The policy of the European Union can act on the representatives of Africa who have [... ...] and democracy.	0
"It is a pretty big deal that they can investigate U.S. citizens without a warrant. Everyone knew that the NSA had surveillance, what's unsettling is the realistic possibility of insufficient oversight of the program's usage, and the classification of the FISA court rulings which may have indicated the unconstitutionality of NSA projects. Specifically with regards to your points though: 1. Through one of the leaked papers we did not only receive information that the NSA was gathering private data, but also received information on which companies had agreed to be used for surveillance. While few terrorists would have used gmail and such before to discuss plans of attack, you can guarantee that with this leak gone public these potential sources of information will dry up. I personally doubt such channels of communication would yield much useful information, and don't think this is a valid reason to keep the program secret, but cannot deny that this leak did make the NSA's job of stopping terrorism a little harder. 2. Snowden has not released all of the data he left the NSA with, and word has it he has distributed encrypted copies of the data as ""insurance"" should he disappear. The language used to describe Snowden is disconcerting, but it is a legitimate concern that with him being in China/Russia that he may be forced to divulge potentially-damaging secrets to foreign powers especially with the implications of having an ""insurance"" data file. The reaction of my country to the leaks is very unsettling yes, in addition to the points you make, Congress has handled the investigation of the NSA quite poorly with terrible attendance at the hearing, mixed messages regarding the actions of the NSA, and not divulging any additional concrete information to justify their actions. However Snowden's revelations of a system which compromises all major tech companies, shares the data with various European nations, and can allow for warrant-less investigation of U.S. citizens is pretty damn unsettling."	0
Yeah, I think as far as immigration is concerned, it's not politically correct to really say what you see. You just can't express your opinion and then it's politically incorrect. I come from Spain, from a small village, and there we don't have immigrants. But when I visit a good friend in Madrid, for example, there are certain neighborhoods; when you get off the subway there, you are not in Spain. You don't know the language, you don't know the cultures, it's really anything but Spain. You really don't know where you are anymore. And that's not all. The people who have come to Spain from different countries simply don't want to integrate. They want to speak their language, they want to continue living their culture. For example, I was at another friend's house, there was a street where children used to play, where the older people played chess outside, and now there are no more children. I said, what's going on there? No, you can't sit there anymore. You can't sit there anymore. There are people living there now, they are Moroccans or North Africans, and if you want to sit down there, you have to pay a euro. And you can't go to parks anymore, that's no longer possible. And that is of course quite terrible, if you have to say that, but these immigrants are disturbing. And of course we can say, well, they have a right and of course they have advantages, but they just don't want to integrate. And yes, that's clear, this situation in Madrid or in other cities it's also the same situation. We are not very many in my village, about 6,500 inhabitants, there is a family that comes from China and I have a friend who comes from Ecuador. And that's all. They are all non-Spanish. So you really can't compare that. When you say immigrants are a problem: Yes, of course it's not always politically correct when you say something like that. But of course they can come to us and find work. I don't want to say now that they are taking away all our jobs. But in Spain, immigrants have contributed to the fact that salaries have gone down. For example, I have a friend who works in a restaurant and now he earns the same as he did 25 years ago because the salaries were always reduced, of course. And if you have to express that publicly, it's really very difficult to express such an opinion.	1
As it comes to Holland, the asylum procedures are often very long, complicated and hard. So when someone comes to our country and applies for an asylum, things are really very complicated and practically, there are no structures which would enable to accommodate such people in an appropriate way. Some people had been living like that for 12 years and had not received any support. This is a real disaster for them and their future, especially for the young ones. What future do they have? They lose part of their youth and live like this, not otherwise. They cannot even attend school because they are illegal. So there are people who often are forced to leave our country and their children for example went to school and cannot pass the final exams and have no diplomas. These are the downsides and unpleasant sides of asylum procedures which are, well, necessary for the immigrants who I mentioned.  	1
"Did you ever consider that the news is biased but not in a left/right way? There's a ""sensationalism bias"" where news outlets try to find news that is exciting while ignoring important, yet mundane or complex stories. There's a ""pander to your audience"" bias, where news organizations try to please their audience rather than educate them. There's a ""pre existing narrative"" bias where news organizations alter stories to fit what most people believe or want to believe. There's a ""don't upset our sponsor"" bias where news organizations will ignore or downplay stories which cast their advertisers in a bad light. Sure some outlets are explicitly liberal or conservative but IMO these are the bigger forms of media bias."	0
It's BECAUSE we're intelligent that we don't want to pass on our genes (or more accurately, we don't value the gene passing enough to be subjected to the responsibility and other negatives of bringing up a child.) We acknowledge that if a trend emerges where the best humans choose not to procreate then we will weaken or even die as a species, but we now have the intelligence to decide we're apathetic to the fate of our species past our own short meaningless lives. It's selfish, but that is what evolution is all about. We're just using it for another reason than survival, because we have that luxury. In short, **it is** bad for humanity to do what we are doing, but we know we are not actually gaining anything from the success of our species past our own time, so why should we suffer on a personal level to help?	0
I do not agree with my neighbour. My name is Sasha. I do not agree with this opinion. I do not think that nowadays economic crime increases. If there is an economic crime then only among the high positions in the country to which immigrants do not have access. 	0
I think that we should know - we should not let people arrive en masse. I think it's also something about immigrants who arrive, who have a work permit afterwards that is not being deported. If these people, for example, give satisfaction, pay taxes, go to school, I don't see why we don't renew their work permit. Because we accepted them, they stayed but so much I don't know, or less, well, all is going very well, why they - as it happened in France, the cause was absolutely indisputable [?], the child was schooled and they sent them back, the parents and the grandfather, to his country of origin, I find that absolutely monstrous. Because they are people who did not hinder, they even brought to the society, I am completely for the immigration because there is a richness to see in all the immigrants. I am not saying that everything is rosy, that all is easy and there are immigrants who are more difficult than others to control, but I believe that it is a wealth in the country and our country - France - is an old country and it is time that there is some new blood and people who make children and not only centenarians. I'm all for immigration.	1

I would take a hard look at 'credit reporting' from what is being reported by a creditor and then what is reported by a debt collection or debt buying company. For example, if a creditor obtains a judgment amount greater than the account balance, that amount is likely not reported because creditors seldom have system capabilities to make adjustments to accounts.  	0
"I think most ""Modern Art"" is pretentious, takes nearly no skill, and is sub-par compared to art before that period. CMV. I've heard the arguments behind the many paintings under the category of Modern Art. I just don't see how these can be considered ""good art"". I won't deny that it is art, I just consider them horrible pieces of art. I don't think all modern art is horrible. Just a lot of it. I'll provide examples: (This one in particular). It's just a solid color, seriously. I feel that the message the ""artist"" is trying to convey can probably be sent in a more pleasing image. I feel that ""modern art"" is just an excuse for untalented artist to create expressions that are lacking in substance without being called out as a bad artist. Change my view, please. Thank you for your time."	1
Unfortunately, I have to clarify something legally. We are talking now, we are now invited in the EU - Jürgen don't be angry with me - you are talking about Spaniards. We are EU citizens and there is the freedom of movement with the four big freedoms. Namely in the services, in the travel... that is snow of the past at all, that is not controlled, and not channeled and not dammed, that is an absolute joke. This is only transitional for citizens from Eastern European countries. These are sliding clauses, 5 to 10 years we don't have an unlimited possibility for Eastern European immigrants. But Spain has been in the EU since 86, he can settle there when he wants. He looks for a job in the German workplace and thank God no German says there - even if it may be the competitor in the construction sector...	0
So I was going to say an illegal intregation to speak or that you can legalize that and controlled, somehow it bites, the words. So you, either you speak of legal or illegal, illegal that falls little criminal or commit a criminal act tu, and then I can say, well the 500000 legal or illegal come in, the we do then nothing and the other we punish then. That is also a bit unfair. I can not make a border crossing, let's assume now times 20 years ago or 22, we have with the GDR that, for example, that our State Council Chairman would have said, 1000 people go across and the 1001st, he gets the bullet. Per year. So in my opinion, there's only then the illegal or the legal. So illegal and legalize that they... somehow it doesn't fit. That's my opinion.	0
On immigration, my opinion in general is mainly... I would like to talk about the quality of this immigration. Should we as Europeans take on or accept all individuals or should we choose, be selective? And when I talk about selective, it is always in the background, an interest here, obviously, that there are specificities of each member country that must defend its culture, that must defend its values. And I think that immigration must be conditioned by...	0
"Validity of opinion is not part of the democratic process. That's sort of the point - it doesn't matter if you're thick or not, you have just as many rights as your fellow citizen. What you're proposing is that under 18's who are intelligent deserve more rights than the unintelligent. Furthermore, how exactly do you plan to quantify ""understanding and knowledge"" - it is totally subjective. If you study history, even modern history you aren't presented with a single interpretation of the facts and told ""that's how it happened"", there's dozens of different equally valid interpretations of a single event. Take a modern example, the Global Financial Crisis - was this caused by poor regulation of the banks by governments, or by people borrowing beyond their means, or by a global Jewish conspiracy. You can't really refute any of those options with complete certainty - so how on Earth can you test someone on it?"	0
It's not because they're physically different but because they occupy a lot of territory and they take a lot of share in our economy - that Hungarians could actually make and fill. And in fact we can't compete with their low prices here. They come in and they invade - of course if I'm a mother and I don't have enough money I'll buy Chinese things but that said, they destroy our economy, so there you go, it's something where you have to see both sides of the coin. I don't mind that they are Chinese; what bothers me is that in a country we have arrived at a situation where most of the population is going to buy the cheap Chinese products.	0
I have to agree with Manfred on that. There is a very special question for me, when we have now addressed our German system; it is true that we have far too many - eh far too few skilled workers. How then - this would be a question for the experts - do the experts want to convey to the incoming skilled workers, however skilled, the incentive to stay with us, when we demonstrably have so and so many skilled workers leaving every year. I cannot explain to myself what incentives are to be created so that the skilled workers really do come to us. Personally, I would be very interested in that. And then, of course, we need immigration - with families - without limits.	0
Sasha said that he is ready to give 10 or 20% of his earnings to help the countries which have illegal immigrants, but now we have economic crisis so often pensioners have only 400 Euro per month retirement. So I guess only few people would be able to give that much money as you, Sasha. The question from where else shall we take money for that if we did not have it.	0
I would like to add something. I think first of all you would have to settle the problem of the crisis and think about what we want to do with immigration; accept it or not accept it.	0
"&gt;convince me that alcohol isn't bad. This is vague. What precisely do you mean when you say that alcohol is ""bad."" I'll assume that whe you say it is bad, what you mean is ""I shouldn't drink alcohol."" While I'm not personally a huge drinker of alcohol, I think I can convince you that should sometimes drink it. The first thing to point out is that if you have only a little (~1 beer), it will not have much of an effect on you. You might notice a small effect if you've never had it before, but you might not even notice it. In my experience, the effect of drinking one beer is probably comparable to the effect of eating one dose of chewable Tylenol. Maybe even less noticeable than that. You might respond by asking ""Why should I drink something that will have no appreciable effect on me?"" The answer is, unfortunately, that sometimes you will be in situations (e.g. parties) where abstaining might bring attention onto you that you don't want. If you have a single drink and say that you've had enough after that, it will be decidedly less awkward. So this might mean you should drink in those situations. (Personally, I've gotten to the point where I no longer will have a drink just to fit in, but when I was 16, or 18, or 20, I definitely would do this.) But what about having more than one drink? Well, clearly you should take things one step at a time (and from your description of yourself, I don't expect that you'd go out and do 10 shots this evening). But some people, many people in fact, quite like the feeling of being somewhat 'drunk.' It can make you more relaxed, more social. Some people who have social anxieties find that alcohol helps them to come out of their shell when they are with groups of people. In sum, alcohol *is* bad in some ways, and it can be dangerous. But other times, it can be relatively benign, and in some situations, it can even be good!"	1
Sorry, was interesting to hear Danish examples as well. I've studied that, yes. I think this is not only a complex, emotionally charged issue, but we also have to imagine that we are not quite realistically gaining a picture of what is really being discussed among the people. Because we are guests here, at the European level, we are polite. So far, I have seen mostly differentiated statements, very different, so almost balanced points of view. I have not heard any populist, right-wing hate speech. You won't hear any. But they do exist, we know that. Secondly, there will be no radical solution on this issue, close all borders, wall Gibraltar, total closure will not work. Even the conservative parties in the central country of the EU, Germany, have acknowledged for years that Germany is an immigration country and therefore will remain one. This will be a very long process on the part of the CDU erh, CSU. The addition of what is real, namely that immigration takes place and has taken place for decades. So in my opinion, venture me there now ahead, there will be only a middle solution. Radical out-foreigner slogans do not work. That is inhumane and we damage ourselves and we would have worldwide also model functions...	0
I think that every country has different problems with immigrants. In France, Germany and Poland, people have different problems with immigrants That is why I think that we should leave this problem for the governments or even employers to solve. Employers know best who to employ and who they need, how many employees and what kind of employees. If we want to solve this problem on the EU level, we will create a big mess. Unfortunately, the EU does not know what the state of art is concerning immigrants in certain country. That’s why I believe that every country should have some general rules about the immigration. The EU can create these rules but the country should decide itself about their implementation. Thank you.	0
They are people who live here. They used to live in Hungary, but they are people who live under completely different laws than Hungarians. So they don't adapt to the Hungarian environment. So they have many more children than Hungarians, so in a certain time, in a few decades, if you like, we Hungarians will be the minority and the gypsies will be the majority. You have to look at what will happen in Hungary from the moment the gypsies are in the majority.	1
I totally agree with Piroska about the Chinese. In fact it's the Chinese who are the most present because they are the ones who jump out at us because they are physically very different from us. Bela also had some questions during the questionnaire that we were filling in, in fact it's true, we don't always know who is really an immigrant and who is not - there are people who are not physically different from Hungarians. There are others who are physically very different from us, and so, when it comes to the Chinese, we are very reserved - in any case, I have the impression that Hungarians are very reserved towards the Chinese, because they devalue our market quite a bit - but at the same time, Hungarians go to the Chinese markets a lot because it's very cheap [lacht].	1
I also wanted to add that because debt collectors know they can hire robo service companies to false service, they aren't going to negotiate in good faith. Just as appalling for me was the judge agreeing that the one service I challenged was a false service, but allowing the case to go forward anyways. Sure, people can lie and say they were not served when they were served, but the very day I was in court contesting the service, a person who spoke before me made the comment that they found their service document on their door step when they got home. This means the servicers are lying in court documents, and nobody seems to care. I still want redress on these two cases, and I want to be able to file an errors and omissions claim with both debt collectors insurance company for lying on court documents. And if it is not a law, then isn't it time that debt collection companies carry errors and omissions insurance?  	1
But sometimes solutions are not easy to find, neither for them nor for us. I, for example, live in a Christian community that from time to time welcomes families precisely to protect them from the all-powerful state, we call the church asylum. These are behaviors that are not embedded in German law, but the authorities have no possibility to get their hands on these people protected by us, because otherwise they will find a great opposition in the population. I think that there are always places that you can go to for help but I think that these places have to multiply and all this is also something that should be created in all countries finally that these people have someone, another speaker to turn to.	1
What I mean is I have had my credit report cleared three times they were never on either of them. And when i think I have cleared all of my crediters they get a judgement and freeze my account.  	1
To your comment; that's true, but the first one is also decisive; there is also a certain percentage who don't want to integrate. This has nothing to do with us; we have a very high percentage of Turkish citizens, that's true - in Germany that is specific in every corner also from the Hopferau, so northern Bavaria where I come from, many are with us in Hof, the proportion of Turks in Hof makes up a third of the population; you would not think that for such a medium-sized place, but it's really because of the cultural circle, where they come from and another comparable example now outside the EU yet: In the Hof area, we currently have a large wave of immigration of German citizens, as they say, well, these so-called Russian Germans from Kazakhstan, from Uzbekistan and other former CIS states, who come to us, and it is striking that younger people come from a cultural area where they themselves had their friends and their acquaintances and definitely their social ties, but because of the family circumstances, it is so that the parents say that we are going there now, then they have to come with us. We have huge problems in the Hof area with the integration of these groups.	1
"I was just watching ""CBS This Morning"" and they mentioned that FICO is going to be partnering with more financial institutions to allow the financial institutions"" customers to get their FICO score for free. FICO is already offered for free with many financial institutions, but now FICO is aggressively expanding this offer through their ""Open Access"" program.  I have known about this ever since FICO put out a press release earlier this month. What I found out today on ""CBS This Morning"" is that Discover is going to allow their cardholders to see their FICO score for free on their monthly billing statement. I don't think this is appropriate for Discover or any other business to put a consumer""s FICO score on a billing statement or any other materials that can be turned over to debt collectors. Right now, debt collectors do not have access to any consumers FICO score. They do, however, have access to something called a ""collection score"" which is nothing at all related to FICO or a consumers creditworthiness. This action by Discover is a HUGE privacy concern and the CFPB should not allow creditors or anyone else to have access to a consumer""s FICO score.  "	1

Require debt collectors to send validation notices via certified mail. There must be some way to prove the debt validation notice was at least sent, if not received. I have had the experience of a debt collector not sending me a validation notice. When I made a complaint to the Illinois Department of Professional Regulations, the debt collector did not have to prove that they sent the validation notice. All the debt collector had to do was claim that they had records of sending the validation notice in their computer system. Since I did not receive the validation notice, I did not know what my rights were.  	1
I am sorry, I was just wondering. In my opinion there is a chance for legalization of the illegal immigrants and perhaps this is the best solution, as we are talking about people who are already here and something must be done. So we can check, whether they have a job, family, whether they are employed and have any prospects. If they are able to take care of their standard of living, apartment, should we put them in jail or arrest them? I do not know. I know that for a longer period of time, politicians have been debating on it. It is hard for me to talk about it and propose a solution, it is hard.	0
I am extremely pro-gay rights, but I think it's gross. Can you CMV? Okay, I'm straight, but I find it disgusting and ridiculous we in the US are even having a debate about allowing gay men and women the same rights as everyone else. I do however, find is wickedly gross when I see 2 guys kissing or touching each other. Maybe less for girls, which is clearly another double standard. I don't want to view it that way, it makes me feel kind of shitty and I never bring it up because the few times that I have I get shitty looks and I've even been called homophobic for this. Obviously I'm not afraid or against homosexuality though. So.. is there any arguments out there that can CMV?	1
Maybe it also depends on the fact that the immigrant applies for his visa extension too late, or how can one get citizenship? If that person works well.	0
So, my colleague referred to something that I agree with. And I would like to elaborate on this. Of course, I am not saying that the European lifestyle is not good. Yes, it is good, we have to defend it. Different cultures don't scare me. Not at all, I like different cultures. I think that in Portugal we don't have problems of cultural differences so striking that we can't live together, no. We have always been an open people. We have always been an open people. We have been to Africa, India, South America, and so on. I myself was a consul in one of the Portuguese colonies in Africa, well, I was only eight months old when I went to mainland Portugal at the time . But I'm not going to go into detail now about these colonies. But what I want to tell you is the following: I saw a report in Spain, about two or three weeks ago, and the Spanish, you know, are living a deep crisis. Well, the world crisis, but in the developed countries. But in Spain, yes, in Europe, in Spain it is one of the hardest hit countries of all the other countries, well, not among the other countries, no. And Spanish people with all this unemployment... Spain in general and traditionally has a very high unemployment rate. And now very, very high. Higher than in other countries, exponentially so. And so, since they can't find work in their profession, let's say. They have their qualifications, they had jobs that they were not interested in. And those jobs that the Spanish didn't want were filled by immigrants.   and the Spanish authorities, despite all the show, the heat, in relation to immigration, have always accepted this immigration. And what I want to tell you is that despite the fact that the Spanish, even the Spanish citizens did not want, some time ago, before the great crisis, did not want certain jobs, certain jobs because they found it denigrating. Now they accept, they even look for jobs in the fields, in the vineyards, hard jobs where we earn our living, which were occupied by immigrants, by Africans, especially Moroccans. What is Spain going to do now with these people, these immigrants, these Moroccans, these sub-Saharan Africans who work in the fields when the Spanish didn't want to work? Are we going to send them home?   Well, we can talk here about a (...) of the world carrassions, of the universal human right, but what Jorge was saying here, we only talk about people based on numbers, on percentages: We have to be very careful with what we do. We cannot start from the end, we must start from the beginning. In Europe, some aspects of things are solved at the end. And at the end, it is too late. The great wars that existed in Europe after the second world war, it was the Americans who came? To fight them. So, Europe, this is to say, that Europe must speak with one voice. [1 :	1
I do not have children, but if i did, i can assure you they would be getting vaccinated on schedule. The science is in, vaccinating children prevents them from getting sick. In the first six months of a childs life, the CDC recommends hepatitis b, diptheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccinations. Believe me, they are not doing it to make a child unwell. Is there a possibility that some children might have a reaction to these medications, sure. Its a ridiculously slim chance, way way lower than the chance of the child accidentally catching some of these diseases. It rankles that kids still die of whooping cough. Mostly from being in contact with someone who has been in contact with someone who has not immunised their child, or had not been immunised themselves. Why do you think that 1 year is the arbitrary point? What development are you derailing in giving a hep vaccine at 2 months? Im fairly sure the CDC did not create this schedule to put your child at risk.	1
That's not true in my experience. Unethical debt collectors just ignore requests now. Most consumers also don't know that debt collectors can call you to collect a debt on any phone number you have used to contact the company or provided the company. So calling your credit card company from your best friend's home phone, your neighbor's phone, or your relative's house puts their phone numbers on your contact list. This practice needs to be changed to protect the confidentiality of the debt collection process.  	0
&gt; I see no valid reason to give a crap load of chemicals to a child who's immune system has not developed. From the CDC at &gt; In 2010, 27,550 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) were reported in the U.S., but many more go undiagnosed and unreported. This is the most number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1959 when 40,000 cases were reported. In 2011, 18,719 cases were reported. &gt; Vaccinated children and adults can become infected with and transmit pertussis; however, disease is less likely to be severe. &gt; More than half of infants less than 1 year of age who get pertussis are hospitalized. From &gt; The younger the infant, the more likely treatment in the hospital will be needed. Of those infants who are hospitalized with pertussis about: &gt; - 1 in 4 (23%) get pneumonia (lung infection) &gt; - 1 or 2 in 100 (1.6%) will have convulsions (violent, uncontrolled shaking) &gt; - Two thirds (67%) will have apnea (slowed or stopped breathing) &gt; - 1 in 300 (0.4%) will have encephalopathy (disease of the brain) &gt; - 1 or 2 in 100 (1.6%) will die From this PDF , in 2012, there were 4516 reported cases of pertussis in babies under 1 year of age. 15 of those died; 13 of those 15 were under 3 months old. The first pertussis vaccine can be given at 2 months, IIRC from when my daughter was a baby. Now. That's the damage pertussis can do. What is the damage DTaP can do? From &gt; Severe Problems [from DTaP] (Very Rare): &gt; - Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) &gt; - Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include: long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness; permanent brain damage. These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine. Answer: nothing. There have been zero deaths from DTaP. Cases of severe problems (things that derail a child's development) are so rare it's hard to tell if they're caused by the vaccine. Recap: in 2012 alone, 15 babies under 1 year of age died from pertussis. Zero people died from the DTaP vaccine.	0
These immigrants, who don't work, they meet 7 to 8 in the same apartment, it's an apartment, a cottage and then, they go in front of the supermarkets, and finally, they have everything they want; they have cell phones, cigarettes, they have free food, and then ask for change in front of the stores. And that I don't understand. I have a friend who is divorced, who has a daughter, and she can't even get access to the resto du coeur. And so, I don't understand how we can give priority to immigrants when, that's it. I was going to say something, but I'm holding back.	1
"One issue I am experiencing is that since I allegedly received an overpayment of wages from a former employer, I have NONE of the consumer protections that I should. I fall into the gray space of being a consumer and my alleged (and incorrectly so) debt is considered ""commercial"" and therefore there are absolutely NO regulations on the activities of the debt collector. The individual assigned to my account has repeatedly revealed to a third party that he is trying to collect a debt from me. The alleged debt has never been substantiated,  "	1
Yeah, I mean just like Julia that the world should be ideal, only now we have an economic crisis right now and illegal immigration is a problem. We don't have enough resources to solve all the problems in the world. Not alone as the EU, certainly. And that's where we really have to come up with something else, we don't have the means now to just lead the planet to bliss. We have more and more ways to tell people what's happening in other countries. In the 19th century it was very different, but now we have a different situation, what we would need now would be to have rich zones that share their wealth with the others. But where there is wealth, there it expands, there was a time in the 60s in Spain where people came to Germany, people went there and enjoyed it. And the other way around, the tourists came to us, they left their money here. We benefited from that for a long time. And I don't know if we can solve the problem of illegal immigration so easily here, it doesn't seem to me to be so simple.	1
In relation to this Focus[GE] article, I would like to rectify something, that is the Berlin thing. This Berlin affair is well known because there are certainly small ghettos formed there, here and there, due to the fact that there are many different nationality groups there. That is mixed up ? For me, personally, it is not an example of successful immigration. We have to do this in the knowledge that the immigrants who come to us have to try to learn the culture, the general opinions in this new country. If we want to build a small Turkey in Berlin, we will always have problems. And by preventing illegal immigration, I think that could already alleviate the problem.	1
"Why should an ""average student who works hard to get B's"" get the same future as people who do well in 5-6 AP classes? If someone has the ability to achieve in a high-stress environment, he is rewarded for it. Why should someone be rewarded for something they aren't able to do?"	0
What a great idea -- record them. Reading these comments, there are so many examples of abuse, it seems like this Consumer Protection agency ought to have gotten the message thus far: the phones are used to harass. The only way to get this to stop is to put some teeth into the laws through civil fines, not put the onus on the consumer to have to sue.  	0
"Yes. I think there is a way to get the debt collectors on board. The CFPB can remind them that debt collection companies may be exposing their own phone reps / employees to unnecessary verbal abuse from customers who have a legitimate justification for being upset because of follow up calls that ignore the updated agreement just reached in the prior call. If the previous communication with the debt collector creates a new timeline for possible repayment, then the debt collector should not step on that timeline by making subsequent calls less than a week later. unless the customers says call back in less than a weeks time. This also gives the debt collection phone rep the ability to say...""It has been a week or longer since our last communication""...Which allows the customer a moment to realize they are not being harassed on a daily basis by the same debt collector. Some consumers have situations in which their income grinds to zero and they may default on more than one account. Imagine 5 debt collectors each calling twice a day. Even one call a week can still equal one call a day if a consumer has five simultaneous defaults, but that is certainly preferable to 2 calls a day from each collection account, which would equal 10 calls a day, every day.  "	0
I think it would. I work for an attorney at a debt collection law firm and I think this would make things a lot easier and simpler.  	1
It might help to take a look at how debt collectors are compensated. I think, based upon people I know who have held such work, that collectors who receive their pay based on a commission are incentivized to abuse the consumer. I do not think the CFPB's mission is to provide job security for the debt collection industry.  	0
"If I am paying for the minutes on my phone, which I do, then I should be able to chose who's call I do and do not want to answer. When it comes up 'unknown"", how do I know it's a Collection Agency, a telemarketer trying to sell me vacation homes, cruse lines trying to sell me a cruse, someone wanting to offer me a better mortgage rate, ect... Every call I answer deducts time from my minutes and that is NOT fair to me. I now block ALL ""unknown, withheld & private"" calls. If they truly are legidimate and want to talk to me, press 1 to unblock, just like I have to.  "	1
I agree that this is about Financial Literacy, However, this is also about the court's enforcing completely one sided credit card adhesion agreements that don't give the debtor/defaulter, rights of any kind, even in the most humanitarian of situations, thereby calling into question the legality of these one sided credit card adhesion agreements. Lets not forget that it was the comptroller of the currency back in 2002 that prevented the Insurance industry from competing in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena with the credit card companies. This allowed the credit card companies to then have an obscene monopoly on overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance premiums they charged their own customers who otherwise could have carried insurance policies that would have frozen interest rate charges for a certain period of time when a life changing emergency occurred. Financial literacy is in play when it comes to the 2% monthly minimum payment addiction scam perpetrated on first time credit card borrowers. 2% monthly minimum payments are literally no different than a crack dealer giving out a few free hits of crack to get people hooked on their product. A person can be buy a $1,000 top of the line television set and only have a 20 or 25 dollar payment due the next month. That's credit card crack in my opinion. Financial Literacy could be a warning printed in bold letters on every credit card agreement warning how credit cards purposely have low monthly minimum payments to lure one into more and more debt, how credit card companies have no compassion for life changing events, and that credit card companies are overcharging for credit card debt suspension insurance by a factor of up to 2,000%. Put those three warnings on every agreement in bold letters, and two things happen, customers have a better chance of becoming financially literate, and it also is an admission of fraud by the credit card companies for all the prior agreements already in place. So the irony is the credit card companies can't change even if they wanted to. But where is the outside force to come from to make the obvious happen in regards to those three credit card wanrings? Apparently it can't come from the CFPB, which is unfortunate because it turn this ties the courts hands that much more.  	0
Is that directly related to the fact that they are immigrants, or is it just that there are different factors that have arisen, for example that Spain has developed in a special way, or that there are perhaps other moral parameters, other meters, and that there is a new situation overall that did not exist before in Spain. So the population has increased and of course, as the population has increased, of course the prison population is increasing.	0
We raised some issues of a problem which concerns not only Slovenia and Poland. Some of the EU-countries have a much bigger problem with immigration policy, especially with illegal immigration. We red what is happening in Southern Italy where the immigrants arrive traversing the sea.  So I think that our problems are smaller than other European countries.	0
"Unfortunately, a few of the suggestions you made would actually violate the FDCPA. Debt collectors are not permitted to ""overshadow"" the validation notice by giving consumers deadlines, making demands for payments, or giving settlement offers. Further, I don't believe consumers need a ""sample"" dispute notice. If the consumer truly has a disagreement or dispute with the debt being collected, he or she should be able to articulate that dispute.  "	0
First of all I would like to say that I am very tired. So today I'm going to rest well, so that tomorrow I'll be in order to participate in this discussion. Because today I have hardly slept. That is to say, I found my round to start with this policy, with this discussion this immigration policy. And that the first two opinions are in favor of this policy being defined by the states and not by the European Union. So I totally disagree. I think that the migration policy should be defined in the base by the European bodies. I don't mean to surprise you by saying that each state obviously with its specificity can't adapt its regulations to its own reality. But it is the European Union that must define the rules. Because otherwise we will be regulating because we know that Europe does not speak with one voice. There is the voice of 4, 5 strongest and then this small voice of smaller countries. We have several voices, if we do not overcome this phase, we will never reach anything. Just to give you my opinion. I am not in favor of a federal state, the United States of Europe. I am not in favor of the United States of Europe, no. But if, a certain policy should be defined by the European Union in a global sense. And the immigration policy is one of those policies. Because we have borders inside and also outside. And through the external borders we have to protect ourselves. But from the moment that a person enters the European Union, the person can enter all the spaces of the EU and therefore, the states, or at least those that are part of the Schengen area, almost all the states of the EU must define and have common positions about the immigration policy. I don't think that the future is based on every man for himself, because we already have our internal borders open anyway, because once a person enters an EU state, he is already in the EU. [1 :	0
"I think homelessness should be illegal. CMV I think people who live on the street need help, even if they dont want it. Large denominations of vagabonds are drug addicted, and need therapy. Many are runaway children from broken homes with no life skills, and need guardianship. A large number are insane, and need to be evaluated, medicated or put into an institution. And let's be honest, many need a shower. On top of all that, a fair number are criminals, concealing weapons (two of my friends got stabbed/bottled downtown by beggers) But when I tell people I think the government should make vagabondry illegal, and ship em off to ""help facilities"" I get looked at like my last name is [Manderley]( Or even Hitler. While the responsible citizen in me recognizes the danger in giving government power to ship off people into detention/forced care, I can't help but feel that some people need it, especially against their will, if their freedom will lead them into drug addiction, crime, prostitution, illness, unplanned parenthood and potentially death. Are my views wrong? Edit: I forgot to clarify, I'm canadian. I don't support the war on drugs, or the overblown US incarceration."	1
State and local court rules sometimes make default judgments much more likely. For example, when a person who allegedly owes a debt is told to come to court on a work day, they may be forced to choose between a default judgment and their job. I urge the CFPB to find practices that involve scheduling hearings at inconvenient times unfair, deceptive, and abusive, or inconsistent with 1692i.  	0
I like the Summary of Rights idea. I think that a validation letter and even an initial communication letter should included of Summary of Rights for State Laws and Fed Laws. This would help two fold: both the debtors/consumers and the debt collecting companies. The debtor/consumers would know their rights and the collectors would then also know the particular rights for the states that they are collecting in. This shouldn't be burdensome at all since the CRA already include Summary of Rights as do employers who check credit.  	0
The majority of the clients I work with try to settle their accounts. The main issue is that most of the collection companies will not provide the client with a letter of agreement until after the payment is made. They also will often wait weeks for a receipt. I have even had clients tell me that the company required a $10.00 payment for the receipt.  	1
If a make an offer to repay the creditor and it's refused, then the debt becomes time-barred, why should the creditor still be to sue? If the creditor is offered a repayment plan, turns it down, then sues after an extended period of time, the consumer should not have to pay that debt.  	0
Obviously, comparisons are not very difficult. In Europe or in Spain in particular, we are forty years behind. Because what is happening in France, well, there was some downtime because of the dictatorship, so asking the question to the Spanish, we all know them. If there had not been the dictatorship, what would have happened; would we have the same situation? We would have the same situation, we would have the same French tradition, that of other countries that have acquired [welcomed] immigrants for a long time. And now, on top of that, we have a problem, the one we see now and in Spain finally, we are experiencing what other countries experienced several years ago.	0
Providing too much information in the first notice creates a risk of divulging sensitive personal information to the person who now lives where the actual debtor used to. I do think that providing the chain of ownership information (especially original creditor) should be provided for sold debts. When it comes to medical debts, HIPPA becomes another concern. Therefore, specific info on medical debts should only be provided AFTER the collector has verified that they are communicating with the proper party.  	0
&gt;Public religious symbols, along with God's name on currency and in the pledge of allegiance, don't do any harm to anyone. Public religious symbols can mislead religious people, who have the ability to influence public policy, about the separation of church and state. Many times I've heard the argument that this is a Christian nation, and that it was founded on Christian values to push policies that violate this separation. Also, if you can understand why it would bother religious people so much to remove those symbols, is it so hard to understand why some atheists would be bothered by their presence?	1
This proposed rulemaking is not about credit reporting. I understand that people have significant concerns about their credit reports. But that belongs in a reform of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, not the FDCPA. Inserting credit reporting rules into the FDCPA would make things difficult for debt collectors who don't report to credit reporting agencies at all.  	0
I don't think the Beatles were so great. CMV I mean, a lot of their songs are sort of catchy, but a lot of them I find are actually pretty terrible. A ton of them are formulaic as well, following basic song structures and chord progressions. Lyrics are rarely profound. I can see why people like them, but love for the Beatles is so disproportionately high compared to other British Invasion bands like the Who, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Clash, etc. Many of those bands innovated far more. I can also understand why they would have mass appeal, even today well after Beatlemania (and even with younger people). I get that. But I want someone to convince me why they are that much better, and why they deserve that excessive recognition.	0
"Unless and until debt collection practices have greater transparency for consumers there will be abuses and misunderstandings regarding legal liability. It's too much a pat answer to say consumers should seek legal advice. Collectors should be required to say with a certain level of supported certainty whether the debt is valid or not. Collectors should not be allowed to rely merely on a borrower's ""moral obligation"" to repay the debt. Financially disadvantaged, naive, and gullible consumers, and specifically those individuals on fixed, limited incomes, i.e., older Americans, ESL citizens, etc. are especially vulnerable.  "	0
"They are using logic, but they take other things as axiomatic. ""A fish doesn't understand the concept of water"" might be analogous. 300 years ago it was taken for granted that witches cause disease, so when a couple of villagers came down with the same symptoms everyone took it for granted that they have to find the witch and burn her to solve the problem. From their point of view, it was as logical as someone today concluding that they have a dead battery if their car won't turn over. Ah crap, time to find someone who can give me a jump. When people accept religious concepts as deep and immutable facts it's just like growing up and taking oxygen for granted. Of course God exists, he made the Earth and everything on it, and he said he wasn't going to fuck around with the climate after the Great Flood. 2 + 2 = 4. It's _that_ logical to them. It's the [allegory of the cave]( Whereas modern science fills libraries, and it's not everyone's priority to read it all, even if they could. The concept that I think matters is [processing fluency]( how easy it is to ""think"" in a particular model. If you understand Calculus thoroughly it can be easier to ""think in calculus"". Or think in statistics, or think in orbital mechanics (you have to slow down to get to your destination faster--woah, that's not intuitive!) Or take the video game _Portal_ and one of it's catchprhases, ""now you're _thinking_ in portals."" Once you _get it_ you take off like a rocket, but until then you flail around because your brain just hasn't reconfigured itself yet. You aren't ""thinking in physics"" or ""thinking in thermodynamics"" yet and can't see how climate change can work. It's not unreasonable, however, to resist an idea just because you can't ""think in fluid dynamics"" or something else that's relevant. How do they know it matters? How can they know what it's like if they don't think in that paradigm, yet? There are lots of ways to think about the world, and we all have a natural tendency to resist new models for good reason: they're wrong more often than they're right. Could I think in the models that make some horrible social injustice seem right? I probably could. For shits and giggles I could imagine what it's like to think in a model where homosexuality is unnatural and harmful and understand why someone would be opposed to marriage equality. I can also think in a different model, where gay marriage is harmless. But if you're not already well versed in both, it can be as hard to ""think in arbitrary sexuality"" as it is to think in the unintuitive world of orbital mechanics, where going faster means you go slower. Religious people think they are thinking logically, and the way to change them is to educate them gently, and without any hostility. We must find ways to let them explore physical models that aren't obvious, just like giving a child toys to play with in the bathtub so they begin to get a grip on basic fluid mechanics."	0
Yes, you have to take measures, of course. You have to help the countries in their countries, so the development aid. But you also have to strengthen border control, repatriation, a European community policy and maybe other measures. But these are concrete measures that will help us.	0
"It seems like you want a moral argument: Your definition of consent that you outlined is the absence of refusal, but that's not what consent is. There are various cases, for example, in which boyfriends have coerced their girlfriends into having sex, so that the girls don't give permission but don't or can't necessarily outright refuse, even if they would not like to have sex. Most people would consider this as a form of rape. This problem is exacerbated when it comes to animals. There is not really any way to clearly communicate between animals and humans to do any consenting. Sure, maybe you can try to ""assume"" the animal is consenting because it isn't resisting, but some animals just stay really still out of fear. Even if there's no readily apparent physical harm, there can be psychological harm, which is much harder to gauge. I've seen dogs that are very submissive because they've gone through abuse, but it's often hard to differentiate between those who are naturally submissive or forced into submission, especially when it happened at a very early age. I suppose you could argue that the animals themselves might be the ones initiating the sex, but also remember that there is a huge power imbalance. Animals are not humans, even if they may have some human characteristics, and they do not think or respond as we would. We are *much* smarter than animals, even more so than children. We can sometimes literally condition them into what we want them to be (a more extreme version of teachers or relatives ""conditioning"" children to love them in a sexual way). So unless there comes a different species that is equally as smart as us and makes similar thought and behavior processes as us, sex with animals will never be moral."	1
What you're saying is that there's basically no tangible difference between a $100,000 luxury car and a Rolls Royce/Bentley. I'm no expert, but my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made. Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted. And as a result of all this, not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher. The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4-door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0-60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k. I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less. For people who have many millions (or billions) of dollars, the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal, and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car. Sometimes they just like to own a unique item, but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes. If the car helps you to secure a billion dollar deal, it was a good investment. edit: typo	1
Yeah, I'm not for selective immigration now, that they say you can come. Many who know, who are skilled, how to manage to immigrate to a country and others just not. We have countries where certain skilled workers are needed. For example, in Spain there is a lack of doctors. For example, you go to an outpatient clinic in Spain and you have to wait almost three days for a consultation with a pediatrician because we have a shortage of doctors. And then you ask the question, yes, doesn't anyone study medicine in our country? Yes, but the young Spanish doctors work in England, in Portugal, abroad, because they earn twice as much there. The income of doctors in Spain is very very low. You simply earn much more in England or in many other European countries in medicine. That's one thing. And then: I'm also not for letting everybody in and saying everything is fine, no. There are just places that are no longer receptive, yes? Of course, when you go to a country, you have to abide by the norms and values that apply there, you have to behave properly. And you are not there to destroy everything, to break everything. My parents, for example, worked in Germany, I was born in Germany, in Frankfurt, and my parents worked there, five or six years I think, they worked in Germany. But my parents, when they went to Germany then they had already found a job, yes? From Spain, they had already tried to find work. And then they came to their factory; they already had an apartment there, and then they worked there for six years in order to earn money, to buy furniture, furnishings, televisions, even an apartment, and then they went back to Spain and that's where I grew up. So the Spaniards who worked in Germany went there to work. The problem is, in Spain; I'm not against immigration at all, but there are very very many people who come to Spain who say we want to work there, but it's not true. They come there to steal, right? At least in Madrid. In Madrid it's like that, many hate or are afraid of Romanians. People buy an apartment, and when you buy an apartment, and then an Ecuadorian, for example, Moroccan, or other people from Latin America move there in the building. So, as I said, people then immediately try to sell their apartment again. That would also be stupid, everyone says, you have to move out of there as quickly as possible, sell your apartment, because it simply loses value quickly. So a gentleman, who is now also in the government, issues almost all work and residence permits, and now many say of course, come now quickly to Spain, because at some point they will close the borders again. And those who then become unemployed - is it so yes then they should go back to their country as soon as they become unemployed, then they can draw unemployment benefits there. But that's not the case. They go back to their country, receive unemployment benefits there and then they come back. They don't stay in their home country then.	1
The creation of ghettos and the fact that immigrants don't adapt and well, if you say adapt, that's hard obviously. The problem is the German language which is not taken over, which is not learned. That is to say that in the school in reality, during the course, they speak German but during the recreation for example they already speak their language between them and therefore if the direction for example tries to make them speak German outside the school, outside the class, the direction does not succeed. So we have people - second, third generation - who don't know how to read, write and so on, so they need their children to translate what they have to do and so on, so let's avoid creating ghettos, but then we have to learn how to read and write at that time. We'll have less of this problem of creating ghettos, we'll have less problems and they're next to us and we don't even know what they're talking about and it's being used.	0
I think it would be very difficult to stop immigration. It's impossible because you have to continue to accept family reunification and the children, for example, who were born here, should be able to stay here too. You can't really create difficulties in that respect. [1 :	0
We are talking about the criteria of entry to our union, right? Unfortunately, there are people for whom entry to the EU is an opportunity to have a decent life, to survive, especially for people from those poor countries, right?

"I am sorry to hear about this situation. This kind of abusive behavior is upsetting to hear as a consumer. They don't need to ""speak"" with anyone. You/your daughter are perfectly within your legal rights to ask the phone calls to stop and to communicate by other means. And the collectors who are refusing to honor this request is in violation. Moreover, they should not be contacting you nor they should be contacting you/your daughter 10 times a day. This is clearly excessive and abusive. I would like to also mention, that although they do have a point about the federal loans can usually be placed into deferment, debt collectors are not fiduciaries and are not acting with nor are capable of providing financial advice that is in the best interest of the consumer/debtor. The collectors will say anything and do anything just to get paid. They should not be allowed to offer advice on what bills to pay and how to pay them. This sort of ""advice"" can be detrimental to consumers/debtors. Perhaps the CFPB should allow collectors to offer referrals on financial advice, but they should not allow collectors to outright give financial advice.  "	0
Ana, you're right about that. The third generation is not seen as immigrants anymore. But they have- Ana, you're right. Of course, the problem is also the third generation in many immigrants. They haven't gone native... and those are our sins of omission. And we stand by that. We say that we have done something wrong and we are now starting to change this in the last two years and are giving serious thought to how we can reintegrate them. There has been a total change. And I wanted to say something else to you [esp, m; see above]. We don't see immigrants as criminals. We see that there, that life as an immigrant is hard. We say to immigrants: the first generation has the life of tears. That is quite difficult to become native there. Only the second generation, they benefit from the new home and become native. And it is a long process of integration. It's not just a matter of them learning the language, but we also have to meet them without prejudice and not point the finger at them, but we have to accept them fully. We are still missing something here. We are only now slowly learning that, too, where we have the problems.	0
"Many disputes are difficult to investigate because it is unclear what the consumer's dispute actually is. If the consumer is specific enough so that there is a clear item to research, we will do so. However, its a vague dispute such as ""I dispute this debt"" or ""I don't owe this debt"" (which is incredibly common), then we will provide statements or a contract to attempt to address it. The amount of the investigation is largely lead by the amount of detail the consumer relays, and most of it results in us relying on the documentation the creditor provides to resolve the dispute. Sometimes we may need to ask the creditor to research their records for indication of X, Y, or Z, but most the time the dispute isn't that specific. I find in my practice that we will often ask a consumer to provide information to support their dispute (such as proof of payment), but then the consumer does not provide it, and we are stuck in our efforts to investigate further. Requiring only a ""reasonable"" investigation without further definition sounds like a punt to the courts to decide the defintion after a lot of litigation. I think at least a broad definition of obtaining documentation to support the position that consumer owes the debt/amount/and creditor is a good place to start. I would love to see consumers use a form letter prepared by the CFPB which spells out a variety of disputes and helps them articulate the dispute better. I do think one of the toughest hurdles for a collector (and one of the biggest complaints from persons against whom collection efforts are made) is when they get a person that states the debt is not theirs (but someone else's ) with the same name. We do our homework on our end to investigate (we'll attempt to compare the last 4 digits of the social, we may run a skip trace to see if party we contacted lived at the address on the statements, etc and we will provide verification, but in a mobile world investigating that the John Smith you contacted is the same John Smith you are attempting to resolve a debt with can prove tricky. This is especially tricky if there is NEVER indication that we have reached the wrong person. We never wish to contact the wrong party regarding a debt, but it unfortunately happens because consumers don't always relay updated contacted information to creditors and a collector then has to rely upon the best information available to them. Unfortunately, I don't know what the fix is here. Despite the stories to the contrary, it simply is not the intent of any professional and responsible collection agency or firm to attempt collections from a party that does not owe the debt, but this is a hard one to address without good communication from the wrongly contacted party and the collector.

"Some economists and CEOs (such as Steve Jobs, I believe) talk about ""spending through a recession"", where you keep hiring and developing even as the market plunges, so that when the market recovers you are in a far stronger position than competitors who cut back on staff and research. And it's like that for the human race as well, because you now have an opportunity to raise a child in an environment where they'll learn values of spending money wisely, the use of restraint, perspective, and humility. IE: we could really use a generation that can compensate for the the ""spoiled brat"" era of Tiger Moms, Helicopter Parents, and Little Emperors. You may feel that our society is archaic and bigoted, but gay marriage and black presidents were inconceivable only one generation ago. And you may feel that the public school system is terrible, but we also have things like [Kahn Academy]( and [Open Courseware]( which were also unheard of a decade ago. The economy will get better, but it may be hampered if there's a void in the demographics by the time we get there."	0
Breakfast is important because it is the first meal you eat after sleeping for considerable amount of time. During this time, you are fasting, and there is no need for your body to metabolise food. However, if you fail to eat when you wake up, your body gets into the habit of needing to conserve your energy for even longer than the 8 or so hours. This means your metabolism slows down, and if you eat the same amount of food as someone else that spreads it out throughout the day, you are far more likely to put on weight, as your body tries to conserve every portion of food you have, as it cant work out when it will next get a feed. Another drawback of this slowed metabolism is that as energy is needed to be conserved, this energy can't be used to think at work/school, or just generally be energetic about your day. Of course, everyone is different and you seem to have a pretty decent metabolism if you are still at a healthy weight etc. Just keep in mind that eating breakfast may increase your ability to concentrate, even if you think you are doing ok right now (:	0
I was talking about the English language not Polish (Laugh) because my Polish is not yet perfect. (Laugh) So we would like to have such a language. If it was English then we could communicate with other parts of the world for example with the US. Of course Polish is a beautiful language.	0
If there already isn't a law or rule at the fed level for when what happens to time barred debts when a debtor leaves the purview of one states SOL and now resides in another states SOL, there needs to be. It should be clear that if a debtor changes states, which SOL should come into play.  	0
Yeah, I have my doubts about that. The people who come into the EU by plane come as tourists. They have enough money, they can stay here as tourists for three months. If they stay after that, I don't see any other solution than having them followed by the police or whatever. I don't know how else to solve it, so maybe it's not what we want. The situation in Spain is very clear. You arrive. In some Latin American countries, they need a visa, they need to be invited. There is a quota that has been worked out with the relevant countries. So there they have to be invited and prove that they have enough resources. Now on the subject of immigration to the United States. That's where they ask you where you plan to live, that's then entered and can possibly be reviewed within the next five days. They rarely do that, of course, but they can then intervene if the worst comes to the worst, and we can put those kinds of checks in place. They should be able to prove that they have sufficient funds, and with the Americans, they should definitely have an invitation. If they don't have an invitation, they will be sent back.	1
Briefly, we must also make a distinction, that is to say, on the one hand, those who are illegal but who have come for economic reasons, but there are also many illegals or they had political motives and we don't know how to simply send them back. So we also have a responsibility to assume as human beings, so Christian.	0
I wonder, you're talking about immigrant children who... the parents have integrated, the children speak the language of origin of the parents. I don't have that notion. Can you put a percentage on it?	0
Yes, the Massachusetts model sounds very sensible and the Feds should consider adopting it or something similar. Two contacts in a 7-day period is plenty, but I think wherever the limits are set they will have to be very strictly enforced. These collectors will find any loopholes, excuses or reasons to get around a regulation like this. There has to be zero tolerance, every time, no exceptions. They have violated our privacy and the right to peaceful enjoyment of our home one too many times.  	0
What we see here, in fact, is that this story of the common denominator, Europe, why we arrive at 27, is unfortunately or fortunately, that is in principle his ideological point of view, it is something else. But the common denominator is only economic in fact. Why do we have 27? It's because 27 can trade together. On the other values, on the other questions, the question has not been asked - do the 27 countries of Europe have common values? The question has not been asked in fact. I am talking about the enlargements, I am talking about the hard core, let's say the countries that came together after the Second World War. There, there were really - and still, it was for economic decisions, it was to group together the metal and coal trade, so we see that we were not really in the (...) either. And for immigration it's the same thing, that is to say, we look at immigration from an economic point of view, we are confronted with that. Then, on how to manage illegal immigration: the question I ask myself is when should an immigration be illegal and when is it legal? That is to say, can an immigrant, who entered illegally, access by the work ticket or by the marriage ticket or something like that, a legal status or not. I believe that this is the question that must be answered. If it's no, there's no choice, it means that by building a wall, in fact, we talked during the break, Brigitte, about the border between Mexico and America, so well, afterwards, we have to see in effect how it happens. This is a physical wall, not a symbolic one. It's a physical wall with curves, everything is metric, etc. Either we accept to manage it on a case-by-case basis and say, here are people coming in and people will come in. That's what I say too. If we let the goods in, we let the people in. Of course, either we cut completely, but we cut everywhere. You don't cut down on humans, you also cut down on goods, you also cut down on trade, etc. And if we agree to say that people come in anyway, legally or illegally, we have to find the means to say when we will give them a blue card or the equivalent. So in France, at this point, we are confronted with policies to flush out, let's say, illegal immigrants, which causes a lot of friction. Well, me personally, I am extremely shocked by certain things, in the way they happen, at the same time, I don't say that the solutions, they have to be found, but we have to always bring the thing back, that is, belonging to [...], we say that the illegal immigrants don't have the right to be on the territory anymore. It means that we drive them, it means that we don't let them in. So this is a question that can be managed at the European level. The fact of saying that we can't let them in effectively, if everyone, as Alberto said, if we let the local politicians, I mean, when I say local... if we let the national politicians answer this question. Unfortunately, they are going to answer in, (... ...) to say, in two, three, four, five years, depending on the chances they have. So, they will give electoral answers. Europe has this chance to force itself to consensus in fact. And consensus is complicated, but at the same time, in my opinion, it forces us to make more intelligent decisions. Although smoother, although perhaps more radical, but in any case, we are obliged to think about it together. That's the difficulty, but that's the chance.	1
Could we work more? I agree, but no one wants to put up with others or likes to be invaded [invaded] in their privacy by others. Even if for some ... it is possible of this intimacy, means his country. But this problem, as you said, it is a problem, which can not be solved. I do not see how. I think it would be better if we could evolve. Even if you want to say that these immigrants are attracted by the fact that we live well. But we can't put them down, we can't kill them. What can we do to them? but we can grow ourselves eventually.	0
Technology does not allow debtors or alleged debtors to distinguish land lines from cellphones of debt collectors; whether private or federal. There appears to be a double standard between the debtor and collector. I have received calls after business hours and sometimes even on a Sunday from a mortgage servicer, whom I will not disclose. This particular servicer has even left an anonymous type of flyer (one that can be hung on a doorknob) with instructions to call the specific servicer's customer service phone number; without disclosing the name of the servicer, although I was already familiar with the phone number. I would classify this as mail fraud because it bypassed the mail system. The same scenario with the service of process regarding my old school loan. The service of process bypassed the mail system These are both issues that should be resolved collectively by and among the FCC, FTC and DOJ (not all inclusive). A debt collector can call the debtor from a phone number outside of the collector's company so it won't be included in the company's phone log. If the debtor attempts to return the phone call, the number is either inoperable or not able to receive incoming calls. Collectors may even call a debtor in order to attempt them to give personal information about lowering the interest rate on their credit card (even if the debtor doesn't have a credit card). It is obvious or apparent that there may be a credit card floating around in the debtor's name unknowingly. These are all scenarios I have experienced. We haven't gotten to the subject of sharing a debtor's information among the debtor's financial institution and the financial institution's correspondent institutions and investment advisor affiliates and other business combinations of the debtor (public utilities companies, mortgage servicers, insurance companies, pension fund mgrs, etc...  	1
My husband called a creditor about payments to an old account and wanted to make the account current after missed payments, due to job loss. The account was reopened under a new account number. Now I have 2 accounts on my credit report with the same amount.  	1
I have been getting calls for a Hispanic gentleman with the same phone number as me in a different area code for years. Every time I tell them that I have no clue who he is and that I would like them to stop calling my number they assure me that they will get it fixed but then I hear from them again a few weeks later.  	1
First, a third party collecting on behalf of a lender isn't, nor should be, defined as a furnisher of information. While the FDCPA requires notice specific to the validity of the debt, the FCRA has requirements for users of consumer reports. Combining two statue requirements in the initial notice of a debt serves no purpose. Sending during the 30 day notice would create confusion in the event the consumer responds, for example, to the validity of the debt and does not include a request about a credit report accuracy. I believe the issue is whether a third party debt collector or debt buyer should report an account to a credit reporting agency which would overlap the original lender's last report on the consumer account. In my opinion they should not. I have seen confusion due to lack of rule clarity. For example, if a consumer files a bankruptcy petition who should report that event? If a third party opts to report then the third party would be required to report events that take place during or after the bankruptcy filing. To date, Title 11 offers no direction to reporting and neither does the FCRA other than a credit reporting agency removing after 10 years.  	0
I contacted the debt collection company and tried to make arrangements for payment of debt, the reason I could not pay my bills is my husband was laid off work and he had started a new job. I wanted to make payments of $100. a month, debt collectors said NO, so I said the most I could afford was $200 a month the said NO they wanted $1,000. a month. Now we have 4 children, a mortgage and utility payment, debt collection said $500 a month my husband brought home after taxes $1,100 twice a month. My mortgage is $1,300 per month not including utilizes so I told debt company that I couldn't pay. I always thought something was better than nothing and that a debt company would try to work with you. I learned that they won't work with you.  	1
I'd like to point out to all the people here claiming to have gotten an A in calculus despite being a humanities major: chances are that you didn't take the real calculus course. You probably took the elective course offered to students outside engineering, math, physics majors. A good way to determine whether or not this is the case is if you got a reasonable grade before the curve.	0
"I would like to return to my own thoughts apart from training. It would be necessary to create an economic structure, not only a political structure. Not only Hungarian companies or other companies, but the European Union should help these people in their own countries, in their own homelands, so that the possibilities of finding work are available to everyone. I think that this is where a reflection within the framework of the European Union will be necessary. I think a good term for this is ""know how"" and I think that we should give this ""know how"" to the developing countries - the know-how. What we should give them is the know-how, how to do it, because they don't know how to do it, they don't really know how to make an economic structure. As far as Africa is concerned, this is a problem of course - do they have a work culture, the same as Europe? No, they certainly don't. They deal with these problems in a different way and you have to create a collaboration with Europe before they can do that themselves. It's not only a question of money but really of knowledge, so how can we transfer this knowledge that we have here in Europe? So that's a problem that's important."	0
Just like Cable companies may expect their customers to give them a four hour window for service calls, consumers should be allowed to choose a time frame they prefer to be called within. If they never respond within that time frame, then the debt collector could try a different time frame.  	0
"Urinating in public can mean doing it in the middle of times square or doing it behind a bush off of a road with low traffic. If i'm sitting on the beach, enjoying the view with my family, I by no means want to see anybody relieving themselves where they will. Understand this, though. If i'm at the beach and I notice you urinating behind a rock or something that provides adequate coverage, I won't bat an eye and I will carry on with my day. Society is not comfortable with nudity. That is why pornography is frowned upon (mostly) and why there are specific beaches in only certain countries that you can go while nude. Parents think that it is some horrendous, scarring thing if their children sees a penis or nipple, so those children grow up having the same opinion. I think the solution to this problem is to redefine the definition of ""public urination"". Urinating in a bush with noone around? You're fine. You stop on the sidewalk and relieve yourself? You get a ticket."	0
I believe attempted murder and murder should be treated as the same crime. CMV hypthetical: Someone makes me mad. I bring a gun to their house, and attempt to shoot them. This creates two scenarios: one where I shoot them in the head, killing them, and serve twenty years in jail. In the second I narrowly miss them, they call the cops, I'm arrested, and serve five. If the intent is the same, why should failed murder attempts be treated lesser than successful ones?	0
Yes, someone has to start, so I'll start. Yes, what does the European Union mean to us, or, I can now only talk about myself or from my circle of acquaintances. The European Union - I have the impression in Germany - does not necessarily come across so positively, at the moment via the press, it is rather the negative sides that come across, concerning our agriculture, other influences by the EU on the countries. The Germans, I suppose, like to see themselves as a cash cow of the EU, who are allowed to pay a lot and get little out and therefore I think it would be quite good if we could get a bit of background knowledge this weekend to deal with such prejudices, which would certainly be the same outside, yes.	1
"I don't think ""safe spaces"" are a good idea. CMV Let me clarify a bit. If a group is suffering physical abuse, then by all means, they should have a chance to speak openly without fear of retaliation. But that does not mean that you should stay within your little circle and refuse to listen to differing opinions. It can be beneficial to share with like-minded people, but I'm of the opinion that discussing with those who hold opposite view points is a much more beneficial exercise. For me at least, any of my beliefs are always open to challenge. I don't feel the need to reinforce my ideas with a circlejerk - I'm confident in my ideals and I'm willing to argue them. If I *can't* argue one of my beliefs, then it needs to be reconsidered. Therefore, I think safe spaces, where only those of a certain group are allowed to speak, are more often harmful than helpful.

"Well, I get at least one call per week from a litigant saying ""I was served with a summons today, and it says I must appear within 10 (or 30) days to answer this complaint, but there is no court date on the papers for me to appear"", and I have to tell them the procedure (and point out to them the blurb about you not physically having to come to court to answer). I'm not sure how much clearer the wording in the summons has to be, I understand them fully, and not just because I'm familiar with the forms, I'm just smarter than the average litigant I have to deal with I guess. The complaints do state that they have the rights to the debt, under verification that is notarized, at first... but they cannot enter the default judgment unless they provide the affidavit signed by both parties who owned and now owns the debt, which is generally attached to their judgments.

Yes, a small observation at the beginning. It is surprising that illegal immigration is easily equated with crime. And now I ask you, is it really so? I think this is a bit heavy-handed. Secondly, in relation to Rudolf [RU], yes, so, respect for the culture of others, that's one thing. But we can't really ask it. In each country of the Union there are regulations of legislation to be respected by all citizens living there. It has nothing to do with culture or non-culture. There are human rights to be respected. The word culture, we must be careful. You can't demand that someone leave their own culture behind, but you can expect to respect at least the laws of the country where you come from.	0
i think i can agree with that, with what has just been said. I feel myself as a Dane. Even though I used to be an immigrant. I work in Denmark. And you can't just generalize that like I hear mentioned regularly.	0
Yes I would like to be allowed to add something and also I think that in Poland - at the moment - relatively speaking we don't have too many problems, for example also no problems because of me with other religions, because this kind of problems don't exist in our country, so we don't really have any reason to be afraid now.	1
I would also like to talk about this. I come from Katwejk. And there, there are quite a few illegal people working. These people are put in a caravan to live in, they are underpaid, and I think it's a very bad thing to have this kind of situation.	0
&gt;if someone brings their baby and it either starts making cooing noises or starts crying *and the parent either does nothing or tries to get the baby to stop crying while still in the theater instead of taking it outside* So this is the real problem. The part about babies is a red herring - if *anyone* is being disruptive, they should leave the theater. You don't need any sort of ban beyond that. Annoying people who talk through movies don't need a special ban. Slightly older kids that still throw tantrums don't need a ban. *Everyone* just needs to STFU in the theater, and leave (with parents if necessary) if they make noise. As a parent, we usually get a babysitter but we brought our baby to the theater on a couple instances when we were pretty sure he would sleep through it. We sat by the aisle near the exit. If he woke up and started making even the smallest noise, one of us was instantly out of there with him. The two of us saw different halves of Hunger Games because we were trading off with the baby in the hall. TL;DR: responsible parents don't need a ban in order to not bother other people, and inconsiderate assholes will always be inconsiderate regardless of what you ban.	1

"I don't believe men can be raped by women. CMV. In the sidebar it says ""for people who have an opinion on something but accept that they may be wrong or want help changing their mind"". Well, I definitely know I'm wrong and that's why I'm here. This post is going to sound terrible and I really want to apologise if I'm offending anyone. I'm trying to change my view here and if you have anything to say, please say it. Part of me knows men can be raped by women. Because you know, it's fairly obvious. If men don't give their consent and women have sex with them anyway = rape. Simple as that. But for the most part I'm just really confused. I'm having trouble coming to terms with how it's possible for women to rape men. Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? I sound like one of those legitimate rape Republicans here, but if a man is being raped by a woman, why can't he just... enjoy it? I know it's a terrible view and again I want to apologise, but does it physically hurt men to be raped by women (as in PIV sex)? Although I'm aware that it would be emotionally damaging... Back to my whole ""enjoy it"" point, if you flip it around, I'm MORE than aware that it would be absurd to say to women victims that they could've just enjoyed it. I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc. I mean I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too (they deemed it ""ridiculous""). I also remember seeing a tweet on one of those true fact accounts on Twitter. The tweet said something along the lines of a man was raped at knife point by five women (his wives? Can't really remember but it doesn't matter right now). A few of the comments were guys going ""what a way to go!"" and ""sounds good"" and just general positive comments. So I guess this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped. I was considering posting this to /r/mensrights but figured I'd come here first. I know people who think like I do are part of the problem. So CMV please. My opinion is making me uncomfortable. EDIT: Just wanted to quickly say thank you for all of the responses, it has really enlightened me :) thank you!"	1
As a Pole I need to negate. The argument which my colleague put forward that in Poland there is a large number of people who profess in Catholic faith. I raise here a religious issue and I can assure you, that there would be no problem with building a mosque. It would be accepted by Polish people as a society. Thank you.	0
I think you're looking at the complaints (though not all of them) from the wrong approach. The fact that people feel backed into a one or the other, lesser of two evils choice every four years is enough reason for disdain as is, but it is only compounded by a trend that seems to grow every election; executive or legislative. People are voting for a President or representative and expect them to be their voice in steering the country in the direction the people want. These people get elected, however, and do what **they** see as right. People are complaining about that, not so much the man himself. I never understood why politicians told me how they felt about certain issues. I don't give a shit how they feel, I want someone who will vote, or in the President's case veto/pass, what the majority wants. But they rarely do and people complain. Is the complaining pointless? No. It gets attention. With enough attention change may come about, whether it leads to an internal reform of how things are done, people voting a certain/different way or an all out revolution. Now to address specific complaints toward Obama and the desire to remove him, this goes back to the idea that even though he was elected, he's not living up to the expectations of those who elected him. If I had to buy a car and chose the 'best of what was offered' and ended up with a car that didn't run at all after a week, I'd want a new car. Just because the salesman said it was great doesn't mean it was or that I should be obligated to keep it. tl;dr Complaining isn't pointless, it raises awareness and may lead to change.	0
So please, let me ask a question to me and everyone else: what is the most important for the EU? Are we talking about immigration from outside of the Europe to Europe, or are we talking about the immigration inside of the Europe, from one country to another as well? Earlier, when one went from one country to another, even here in Europe we were perceived as immigrants. We were called immigrants, and that is why I think that immigration can concern a smaller territory. Africans who also come here are immigrants as well, so what are we talking about? Are we talking only about Europe, Poland, and other European countries or about immigration in a broader sense?  	0
In Spain, we also have another problem with immigrants. We have, for example, of course, our historical relations with South America and there it has always been that we have immigrants from South America, Spanish-speaking families. We also have, of course, a large number of immigrants from South America who can then also acquire Spanish citizenship, because they are also Spanish families, quasi of Spanish origin. Of course, this is very different in Europe.	1
I would like to make an observation: The topic immigration has become very very important in Europe. Why has it become so important? Because, migration always existed in Europe. I'll just say that we should take the question back: Which migration are we talking about - European or extra-European? That's all.	0
So in fact, in the meantime, in the Lisbon Treaty, this has already been settled. It is not yet in force, but the broad outlines, the bases, the foundations, yes, that is where it was put forward, in the Lisbon Treaty.	0
The most important would be not to call at work. That's really the most important to the collectors, too, because a person out of work isn't likely to pay.  	0
I think we shouldn't talk now about whether or not the EU as a whole needs more rights now, or whether we conclude a relatively undemocratic Lisbon Treaty, or whatever, but we should focus on the issue of migration first.	0
I believe that The United States has no right to claim that it's the greatest country in the world. CMV I believe that this countries very foundation was based on violating human rights (western expansion and manifest destiny) and we continue to do so to this very day. I believe there was small window during WW2 where we were all united and prosperous but since that time has passed we've begun degenerating as a country and I fear that Americans pigheadedness and constant 'murrica circlejerk is going to blind us to the very real condition of our country where wall street robs the little man blind and a tiny majority of the populous controls a vast majority of the wealth. The average duration of unemployment in this country is at an all time high of 39 weeks, while 5.5 million Americans are unemployed and NOT receiving any benefits. Low income jobs account for 41% of all jobs in the US and a good majority of manufacturing jobs are being shipped away to foreign countries. Our education system is abysmal, tuition for higher education is going no where but up, driving many students deep into debt that they fear might never get payed off, delaying the big life events such as marriage, children and owning a home. In primary education, our country is ranked 25th in Math performance, 21st in Science, and 15th overall. This is among just a fraction of issues we face as Americans, to say that we're the greatest country on earth is arrogant and ignorant. CMV.	0
I would suggest that debtors who INVOLUNTARILY defaulted on a debt don't have the money to hire an attorney, so they don't see the point to going to court without an attorney. Why doesn't the court give access to free legal counsel to debt defaulters the way they do to those who are accused of committing a crime?  	0
I understood that, I agree with you, but I am more in agreement with Micheline: What do we do with those who are here now, right now, and who are ruining people's lives and all that? For me, that's the priority and that's what they can work on, it's not the others who can do it either. It's the ones that have been there for two or three generations.	0
"Given the highly coercive consequences of having negative information reported to or by CRAs on consumer credit reports, I think it is reasonable that a debt not be deemed ""verified"" or ""substantiated"" unless and until there's a final non-appealable order, but only in circumstances where the consumer has timely disputed the existence or the amount of the debt. Currently, if you dispute a debt, the debt collector reports you to the CRAs and your credit standing is adversely impacted; i.e., the damage is already done at that point. In other words, the notation on the credit report that the debt is disputed by the consumer is largely ignored by potential lenders, employers, landlords, etc. Thus, disputing the debt does nothing to prevent harm to the consumer. The debt collector and creditor threaten to report you to the CRAs as a coercive tactic to force you to pay a debt even though you might legitimately not owe the debt or the amount claimed to be owed. As for my proposal, I do not think this will lead to more litigation. Just the opposite. If a consumer doesn't timely dispute the debt, then the debt can be deemed verified or substantiated. If, however, the debt is timely disputed, creditors and debt collectors will have to evaluate whether to initiate litigation and weigh the likelihood of prevailing at trial and this may cause creditors and debt collectors to be more judicious about which debts to take to trial. This proposal would also protect consumers from having their credit standing negatively impacted until after it is conclusively determined that a purported debt that is disputed is in fact owed and the amount of such debt is conclusively determined. As an alternative to my initial proposal, a rule could be adopted that would impose significant statutory penalties, treble damanages and recovery of attorney's fees against creditors, debt collectors and CRAs in the event the consumer can prove either the disputed debt doesn't exist or the amount of the debt is less than that claimed to be owed. This approach, however, places the burden of proof on the consumer and I feel strongly that the burden of proof should be on the creditors and debt collectors to affirmatively prove the existence and amount of any disputed debt before a consumer's credit report is adversely impacted.

Well it's now a reason why people are leaving the country. But I can't assume...I hear that people go on vacation, then they're also eligible for a visa and then they don't go back. After that, they become illegals and then they have to be handled as such, so that's where you have to intervene. That has to be said very clearly, I think. Legal migrants are the ones for whom we provide quotas, and the others don't fit into the picture. As soon as they become illegals, they have to intervene, I mean. Even if we took everything from their countries of origin in the past... never mind. Illegal is illegal. We certainly have to help them escape poverty in their countries, but otherwise a rule is a rule.	0
So it is just how it was with the gypsies in Slovenia. Exactly the same problem appears.  In fact, gypsies in Slovenia are problematic because they do not want to work. They do not pay for school, for meals in school, they also do not want to pay. So we need to give them some kind of lesson, teach them something, educate. Sometimes even children do not want to go to school. Give them a rod that would actually fit me. It works somehow. Of course it is not easy. We should first think of why we are doing this, how much we can gain of this?	1
Why are these questions putting the onus, once again, one the consumer? It is the collectors who have harassed in the name of collecting a debt. It is pretty easy to distinguish landline from cellphone google the number, that tells you. But creditors use recorded calling, that should be stopped. If they have a well-trained person, that person ought to be able to determine the time zone the consumer lives in. I agree with the previous comment. Creditors should assume the current mailing address is the correct one. How difficult is it to go from there in assessing the times that are appropriate to make calls?  	0
So he has a clear opinion on this, apparently. It's good to start the discussion in this way. But I have a magazine called Focus, so it's a weekly magazine and they talk about everything, for example that the police will organize themselves, so against vandalism groups for example.	0
Now as far as education is concerned in Europe there is something which is very positive now in Poland: We have now professional vocational training and there we have very much influence from Europe and that is very positive, because through this professional training, we have reached a very high level. I would like to add something regarding the introduction of the euro: I think that the politicians have not yet prepared that properly, because especially the people who have low salaries or those who are retired - I think the Poles just can't survive; that is, so that will be very difficult for the Polish families; they are just not yet - Poland is not yet - ready for that, to introduce the euro. I think that's important, but I also think that the people have to be prepared first. Someone who gets a very small pension - 700 zloty - he will then have only 200 and the prices in Poland are almost the same as in Germany.	1
One last thing I would like to add. Democracy is based on rights. Someone who comes has rights, but then there are also duties in democracy. We give rights and obligations. The people who come must then also comply with the obligations that come with the rights.	0
In my opinion,collection companies,credit bureaus, and every one in between should be made to have some type of soft ware that could identify time-barred debt.Plus, regulation that will not allow creditors/buyers to reactivate an old debt. If a given state has its own statue of limitation regarding a legitimate time line to collect a debt, so be it. The Validation Notice,should identify the true facts of the debt in question. After complete due process has been exhausted, the record should be completely removed from the consumer file.  	0
I understand your concern and desire to stop the calls that are not for you. No one should be spoken to with disrespect. I dislike the fact that there isn't a clearinghouse of sorts for phone numbers that would help eliminate the needless calls. Of course how would you stop a responsible party from adding their number to the NOT responsible list? It is also unproductive for collection calls to be made to wrong party consumers. There isn't a benefit to anyone to spend time making these calls. There are many rules and regulations to keep collection agencies honest and legal. And there are consequences if they don't. Do you know of any consequences to someone who gives out a bad phone number, address or even a name? I think we should all ban together to restore integrity in the world of credit and stop making excuses for people who want to get out of paying.  	0
The contractor was just able to make up an invoice and send it to the collection agency. At the time legal action was being pursued against the contractor and we then had to deal with collection agencies aswell as a unlicensed contractor. So in answer to your question , I dont think it would have made much difference as it appears that an invoice is sufficient grounds to file a claim  	1
so, the question about the borders, whether we should close the borders, does stem from the fact that many people want to come into Europe. [Many want to come into Europe. How could we prevent that people want to come here because those people don't want to abandon their home land].	0
I would like to say, that I agree with Gerard, and I want to add that in my opinion, it is very important to not be prejudiced against the cultures we do not know. We should be open and tolerant when the other party wants it as well. If there will be acceptance and tolerance from both sides, I think there will be no problem with assimilation and the cultures will influence, pervade each other as well and learn from one another. Thank you. 	0
I think that one should basically say that a job that is to be done can be done by anyone, whether they have documents or not, and there you first have to ask yourself who is doing the worst cases. We already know the answer: those who don't want to do the work will have it done by an immigrant. I believe that the greatest guilt lies in the hands of the countries themselves. There are different reasons why the situation looks the way it does, there are people from the middle class who then allow themselves to employ someone who comes from these immigration countries in order to take a better paid job. In Spain, for example, there are a lot of Americans who work as cleaners or cooks or whatever and the Spaniards, who can then have a better job, then leave the dirtier work to the immigrants. That's probably one of the main problems with that.	1
So I like in spite of everything for and again that the peoples are now talking to each other and not as before they put it on in other ways; their disagreements.	0
Before we talk about immigration of people outside of Europe, maybe there are already things to do in Europe in terms of people moving to Europe. Because Ireland needed workers so they asked Poles to come and the Poles came, no problem. And when there was more work, well, they said, out with the Poles.	1
So one idea was: you yourself come from a country like Romania. So what is the situation there? Is there a possibility to welcome these people? So you are also a country bordering in this case towards Eastern Europe so it's just an informative question so: what would be the possibilities for Romania to welcome people coming from the East?	0
When two parties engage in a lawsuit, each side presents the evidence they have supporting their assertions. As a collector, I provide proof of the debt The debtor is also expected to present some proof that the debt is not theirs. Yes, the assumption is innocent until proven guilty but you have to provide evidence to support your claim of innocence. If I offer a signed document that says you agreed to the purchase and documentation that supports that you did not pay, I have fulfilled my side of the burden of proof. The debtor also bears a burden of proof in our system. That's what the judge is for - to hear both sides, weigh the evidence, and make a fair decision based on the evidence and arguments presented.  	1
AT & T is notorious for setting up new accounts that don't have an official phone number attached. I was put in the situation of having an 800 number that AT & T customer service reps could not find in their system. I had no way to cancel it! Eventually the false 100 dollar debt went to a debt collector. I respectfully explained that the debt was not valid, in a letter. A few months later I got a letter from a different debt collector. Again I wrote a letter. A few months later another letter over the same faux debt from a third debt collector.  	1
The notion of strong borders, what does that mean? It's a little bit of a dream that we created because it doesn't exist anywhere. What is always true and valid is that if you establish a high level migration policy and you apply it to the letter, you will get results. You take the example of Canada and the United States or you have the answer. Even if there, it is not ideal. So the strong border policy, I don't know what that means.	0
If emails are allowed, they should not be allowed to be sent outside of what is the acceptable time for phone calls. I would like to restrict the time to inside normal business hours for the locale of the debtor, because no business email should ever be sent from the office outside normal business hours. This is basic and normal business etiquette for emails. But a compromise could be made for what is accepted for phone calls. However, I would like to see no emails sent on Sundays. The USPS does not operate on Sundays and neither should emails of a business nature.  	0
Well, the Poles are already Europeans, so they are not immigrants. I think that in Europe, even before we start talking about immigrants, there is already a migratory flow in Europe, if we take the case of Ireland for example: I have family in Ireland, my mother is Irish, there are many Poles who came to Ireland. For the Irish they were immigrants, well, that's how it was. Even if it's part of Europe, the Irish are seen as immigrants. With the economic crisis, many Poles went back to Poland, because there is no more work in Ireland. So, it is good to talk about the immigration of people outside Europe, but this immigration already exists in Europe, between European countries. It has been said that the Chinese, they are everywhere, but the Chinese are people who work a lot, I have many Chinese friends -.	1
We have now once contrasted Germany and Poland - no not contrasted, but we have once looked - we are within the EU and what these are already for differences in the cost of living and in the lifestyles, in the wages, in everything. We are supposed to discuss how it is with people who come from outside the EU, that is, I often think of - well, I always have pictures of Africa in my mind when I think of this topic, where people are - the conditions, I don't think I can capture them all. And when we see how widespread it already is here, and I'm thinking of the Polish asparagus diggers, of the seasonal workers who were no longer allowed to come over here a few years ago, because it was precisely the EU that imposed the restrictions, because that's what the German workers wanted. The result was that at some point these jobs were no longer done; so in a certain way you also have to look at who is willing to do this work and who does it. And we have to look at what about people who come from further away and how we want to deal with them. And I think we have just said, in legal migration, that we are actually not afraid of it or that we don't see any regulations, but I still see the difficulty, what do we do with the illegals - and maybe we should discuss that again.	1
Yes, but it's very complicated. It's not just limited to the EU, maybe we should involve the US in such a system as well.	0
I wanted to react to what [MAR] was saying, we say, if the people we go to get married, but it is often a tradition in this country unfortunately. For some it's good, for others it's not so good, but in my opinion, I'm against it too, but it's a bit in the culture. And to take away someone's culture, it's like you're preventing that expression too. And there, there are many things in there that are not good that we don't appreciate. But there are also things that they don't like about us either. Anyway, that's it. I hope that everybody could take that into account in this kind of situation too. There are also people who come to work in my region, who come from Africa, or from many other countries, to look for work. If there is no work in the Netherlands, if there are no workers in the Netherlands, then people from outside of Europe are brought in to work in certain jobs that the others no longer want... and if they don't want to, then there are still illegal immigrants who do it anyway. And then the choice for the employer becomes so difficult. Either I drop everything, everything I've tried to build, I can't do the job anymore, or I'm going to try to continue in the business with these people. They come here to put some money aside for the people back home. Well, when they do that, they work very hard. That I can guarantee you. And I find it very difficult also to define a measure to try to send everybody back. Baf, every country could say, well, we'll go to work ourselves. Not everybody can go and sit behind a desk. And there are some good jobs and some... we can't all have the best jobs. There are other jobs too. [1 :	0
It sounds like you believe the creditor/debt collector's attorney should be responsible for giving legal advice to the consumer (i.e. the opposing party). This is a serious conflict of interest and a violation of his duties to his client. Even worse, it sounds like you also want debt collectors who are NOT attorneys or employed by attorneys to also give legal advice to consumers. This is a violation of the prohibition on the unauthorized practice of law. I understand that the ignorance and lack of sophistication exhibited by defendant debtors is a concern. I recommend that the CFPB develop a model notice of rights under the FDCPA. If it so chooses, it can also maintain on its website an area for state-specific resources related to State laws, and reference this website on the form notice.  	0
Well I do want to shout. You've never been on the receiving end of a collections company that treats people like cattle with dollar signs on them, whether they owe money or not. And it's been going on for years. Shame that is the first comment to make to me.  	0
There should be a federal rule prohibiting collectors from reporting information to a CRA during the 30-day window. There are automated processes in place with many collectors where they will generate 4 collection letters at one time, including the one where they tell you that they have reported you to a CRA. And then they will mail all those to letters (all dated on the same day) to you at the same time. And this is done without any debt verification whatsoever.  	0
yes, in Spain we have a situation that is different than with them in Germany. So traditionally, we have always been an immigration country. In this respect, it's the case with us that in Spain you don't quite see yet what the effects are that you've already had in Germany. And we are now also experiencing them in England, for example, with the Pakistanis or in Paris with the people from Algeria. As a result, it's quite important for us to get to know their experiences. Because as you just said, the immigrants who went to France, they were Spanish, they were Italian. But now that we're all in the EU, we don't see ourselves as immigrants anymore. So for example there are still Spaniards who go to France to work because we have the common market. And now we only talk about migration, that is, transfers, for example, that workers go from one country to another and so on. And of course it's also true that we have, let's say, come closer together. We are all in Europe now, and we differ from those who come from outside Europe, for example the Africans of the Near East. For example, they have a religion that is somewhat antagonistic to ours. And there is now the following: finally I had the chance to stay during a time in Morocco. And of course we were afraid of the unknown and of this society, which is so different from ours. And I had the opportunity now to live there and I suddenly understood why they want to come to Europe. You know why they want to. Because nobody has money. But they all want a satellite dish, or they want to have all the European channels. And then they see the beautiful houses, then they see the beautiful parks and a world that seems almost an ideal world. Yes, and now they have that right on their doorstep, so to speak. And there it's very difficult for someone to see that, in their own situation. For example, in Median or in Fez. And there you have the feeling that regressions are being made, so it's almost like going back to the Middle Ages. And the big fish, they swim right in front of the door. And otherwise you only have mosquitoes. Or flies. And if you buy a leather vest, for example, it stinks like anything. And the Arabs work under this inhumane milieu and they see what we live there, then of course they feel like coming to us. And I am the first to understand how they feel.   but of course we can't take in the whole world. But you understand the reasons why they want to come to us. They all have television and that's interesting to see by the way. In a country where it also has poverty neighborhoods, that they all have satellite dishes. And they all try to have television, of course. And so globalization is spreading to the farthest corners. And I can tell you that in the Atlas Mountains near Marrakech, for example, there is a small residential area that is medieval. But the people, they offer then their specialties and so, but all have TVs with satellite dishes and see what's on, for example, in Madrid. And all of Africa has seen how Madrid played against Barcelona, for example. So you're really globalized. So it goes all the way to the last corners of the world. And of course I don't want to go on for too long here, but this whole issue has become so complicated. And of course, you can't close all the borders now. You would really have to put up a guardian every 200 meters, even in Amelia, in this little enclave they really put up grids that are four meters high and still people try to climb over them.	1
Consumers generally have no notice and do not know that a debt has been sold until checking their credit report or until a collection agency calls to collect a debt. Being notified of a debt being sold, would at least allow the consumer to verify who is actually the owner of a debt. I once paid a debt to a collection agency, only to find that I had paid one of 3 collection agencies who claimed to own the debt). With regards to costs, most consumers and most debt buyers are unable to detail how a 2200.00 debt becomes a 7000.00+ debt. And I found that very few even knew the original creditor's name, yet still attempted to collect this debt. The new rule should at minimum state the Original Creditor's name, and that Debt Buyer has purchased the right to collect the debt. This would allow the consumer to verify that a debt buyer has the right to collect the debt.  	1
We had considerable unemployment in Poland and as a result many emigrated, to England and to Germany. Now, for a few months, we have had a severe economic crisis throughout Europe, and those who emigrated at that time are coming back, and as a result, unemployment is now increasing again in our country. From this point of view, immigration must be controlled in Poland, but not only in Poland, but everywhere, because this problem appears everywhere.	1
I have friends from Latin America and many other places and they work and they pay in a pot. So, I'm a mother and well, unfortunately, if I have to go to another country, well, I try to integrate in the country I'm going to. I'm not going to go there, to impose my goals [?], my way of seeing, no. I'm going there to work and not to steal. And there is something else. But again, I'm holding back.	1
A contractor who did work unlicensed was able to file bogus claims against both me and my wife amounting to double the original bid price. there was no court action. I managed to get rid of the debt collector but there seems nothing I could do to stop another contractor doing the same thing. There should be a penalty for the people filing the false debt. The amount in question was almost $10,000  	1
So I think we're dealing with two absolutely fundamental problems. The first one is integration and the second one is [...], of course, from the point of view of nationality, because in the long run, immigrants can wait for their nationalization, they can wait to obtain the nationality of the country in which they live. I think that the integration in fact it supposes that the immigrant must already know the language of the country, either learn it on the spot. So, it is I suppose an effort of integration, which is not always done. The state should help or even force, either directly or through associations, the immigrants to learn their language. This does not mean abandoning one's culture, but it means that one really wants to integrate into a new community. I think we can agree on that. And secondly, the point of nationality; on what criteria can we give a nationality to immigrants; this is where we touch the central [point] of the problem, I think.	0
"Please go hard after the service industry. They have done a lot to foul up the debt collection process by having their service people FALSE SERVE and FALSE SUBSERVE prospective debt collection alleged defaulters. It's happened to me twice, the first time the process server simply guessed by using the most generic age size, weight and assign a made up name! The second time the servicer simply called the sub server ""Jane Doe"" and once again made up the most generic cut across as many age, height and race descriptions they could come up with, which meant they could not be more far off. Then when I went to court I just happened to hear another defendant make the claim to the judge that they were never served, that the paper work was left outside the door. Besides the service company lying in court documents about serving someone that was not actually served, which in and of itself should be enough to give the judge some type of latitude to do something to protect the defendants, when a debt collector knows they can get a false service, they have MUCH LESS MOTIVATION to negotiate with the defendant. Judges don't seem to get this aspect of false service. I know what I know and I will state unequivocally anywhere that I have twice been false served/subserved.  "	1
"A marital spouse is no longer a marital spouse when either martial partner dies. The end is death. A spouse doesn't remarry while still married, but unmarried people will remarry.

Once the marriage is over, the ""spouse"" is no longer a ""spouse.""  "	0
Credit bureaus are responsible for 95% of identity theft and inaccurate consumer credit files. It's because their revenue comes from businesses who pay for access to their databases including phony ones. I have a letter from a credit bureau that says the only thing they do to investigate/verify accuracy is ask the entity that initially reported the information if it's true. New rules have to put tighter restrictions and procedures on credit bureaus because they are the root of the actual problem. Secondly, because they are private companies who should not be able to collect or retain any financial information without consumers permission. Submission of proof of debt or other evidence/documents should be required. Retention of the identity of the actual [business] persons reporting the account information should be required. Credit bureaus and debt collectors should not be allowed to sell lists of accounts especially after the accounts are disputed. One creditor, one debt collector. All debt collectors should be required to register on a national database, including phone numbers, that's publicly available online which they must update within 5 business days regarding any changes. All lawyers should not be banned from becoming debt collectors. Here is a a group of people that are trained, licensed in their State, but they lie to circumvent the law and the courts. At the heart of the mortgage fiasco were unethical lawyers who acted strictly for greed. None of them were prosecuted or disbarred because they hid themselves as representing lenders.  	1
No, wage dumping they have in every industry, whether that's at doctor or anywhere else. In the hospital, they have an 85-hour week and then there's on-call time, which you don't get paid for. If that's not wage dumping, well - for me it's slave labor. I'm sorry.	0
I would like to summarize as far as the illegal situation. We have laws that say that these people can't come in and then based on that, I think that even though it's difficult to try to apply the existing laws and to awaken the application of the existing laws. So the one who is illegal obviously he is not supposed to... he is not registered and therefore does not exist, quite simply.	0
If a consumer sends a post dated check(s) and it bounces then it may not fall under the bad check enforcement. Also, consumers use ACH capability to repay a debt, so if the amount is not available, then this may also not fall under bad check enforcement. My experience is more consumers use ACH rather than personal check distribution. there are numerous reasons why checks bounce so I suggest a look see as to determining the reason or cause why the check bounced.  	1
Yes there I would also like to comment on that: I agree with you now; for Germany specifically, one should perhaps also not forget the following: In the next few years, we will have a huge deficit in the population development between those paying into the social security funds and those receiving social security funds. So without a targeted immigration - especially skilled workers - the welfare state in Germany will definitely no longer exist as it is now and the sealing off of the borders - what we said - so sealing off a border is already in a way a profane means to act on it but as long as this social gap between the individual states exists to the extreme extent, so even closed borders will not be of much use, but the EU as such - if one addresses the EU, in my opinion - should rather exert influence to support the states in their own state and to raise the respective social level.	1
Yes, if the immigrant worker is working well, if there are no problems regarding the law, then surely he is not in conflict with the law, then why can't he become legal? Why is there still problems then?	0
Especially the immigrants in Romania, Armenia has kept... no, Portugal could have a lot to learn from us. We don't let immigrants conquer us. We don't accept them, in a somewhat younger state in Europe. But Romania has protective laws and we have kept our identity as Paulo said. And I have seen that a Portuguese man has kept his pride. Romania has never faced this problem. In our country, too, if your skin color doesn't suit you, you're out. We have a tendency to preserve ourselves as a people. 39:02	1
"I don't think that we are discussing how to block a collector from calling you. You shouldn't have to feel that you have to "" block "" a call . You should just answer and ask them not to call you.  "	0
They will just continue to call. Not answering does not stop the constant calls. They need to be required to identify themselves accurately so the consumer has at least a fighting chance to speak with them. In my case I have no debts of my own but am constantly harassed for other people's debts because I have a fairly common last name. They just start calling everyone with the same last name as their actual debtor.  	1
I would say that you never know how something will turn out when you start something, but you have to try it! You just have to give it a try, maybe it will work. And I also see Obama as a role model somehow, he has in this chaos in America, I mean that is so terrible what has happened there everything and he just tries it and you have to do it, you have to try it. You'll see if it works or doesn't work.	0
The problem is really complicated because there are people who arrive without papers, without anything, we deport them to what country? We don't know where they come from, they don't say, maybe they don't know any language, so that's the problem really very - I don't know what we can do. I think that we should have a policy that allows us to integrate people and still integrate them properly. Even if we send them back to their countries, at least we remain human.	0
"The idea is sound in principle, but as any technology geared towards convienance, there are risks against privacy encouraging identity theft. Having creditors, collectors, and consumers come together ""on the same page"" regarding debt would be fantastic for everyone involved. But any technology which accomplishes this needs to be very secure with very strict authentication requirements to ensure *only* the relevant parties can view information concerning the debt. Otherwise, not only thieves would have access to this information but also non-criminal third parties, who may never have learned of such information due to the protection of consumer privacy laws. Knowledge of the debt and money owed would need to have the same level of security afforded to consumer reports and information within a consumer report (as defined in the FCRA).  "	0
I think Hartmut's proposal about the differential treatment of people is very important. For example in Germany we have the following problem: Sometimes children who go to school are recognized as children of illegals. So this raises the question, do teachers have the obligation to report this fact? To send the police to them? So it's really a dilemma, first of all, as far as the children are concerned, I think that they really need to be given special protection, differentiated treatment. That means that you really have to look at case by case, that you have to have some kind of control mechanism and that every individual has the right to appear in court, to assert their rights.	1

after this idea, I can just, finally make a question. Do we have policies in Europe? That it does not have the political collage to solve the problem.

"The collection agency is not required to actually validate the debt and provide information to the consumer. Example, I disputed a debt as valid. The return validation consisted of a one line sentence: ""The consumer owes the debt."" This is not to me or to any reasonable person validation. The collection agency should be required to at least furnish enough information to allow the consumer to recognize or dispute the debt. That information ideally would be a copy of the original application and a copy of the final billing statement.  "	1
I would like to disagree with Petra for a moment. The crime rate is constantly rising, even in the triangle Düsseldorf-Cologne-Solingen-Wupperthal, it's the evening order that assaults take place on young people, on older people - I don't want to quite subscribe to what you're saying we have no crime.	1
I will answer very quickly. I saw this report, I see what you [PED] are talking about and I add the following: the answer was given by the body. It is that Spain pays these immigrants a return ticket to Morocco and to other African countries. And yes. This is perhaps in anticipation of what I was saying earlier. It is a measure, given the lack of an immigration strategy that is involved by the Spanish state. The Spanish state has a problem especially with Spanish immigration. Sub-Saharan and Moroccan. I know that there are people who have been interviewed, Moroccans or sub-Saharans who said that they have not had a job for a year. And so now Spain is paying for return tickets. And when I talk about Africa, I am also talking about immigrants from South America. That's an advantage to be able to watch all these reports. An advantage of being unemployed. Why I'm unemployed, so I have time to watch all this. [1 :	1
I think it's economically and socially irresponsible to have children right now. Please CMV. First I want to explain *why* I need this view changed: I like children, a lot. So does my live-in boyfriend and soon to be fiance, and we've been discussing having them a few years down the line. We're financially responsible, and net in about 30K a year together. No food stamps, just simple living, etc. This would be an adventure we'd take in our late twenties, and we're only early/mid twenties now. The problem is, when I look at the future, I am absolutely terrified for any future kids of mine. I certainly can't afford a degree for them, I can barely afford one for ME. I find our public school system lacking and the job market lacking any more. Connections were the only thing that got me this job, I don't think blindly fishing works anymore. I'm very happy about the advancement of medicine, antibiotics, hospital care. I know my child will be healthy... but happy? I'm not sure. Racism, classism and other bigotries still run rampant. Violence is everywhere, I can't walk around at night comfortably without packing heat. We're both white, so I suppose I shouldn't worry about the racism bit, but what if I have a gay or lesbian child? What if they're mentally ill? What if they're smaller and weaker? I feel like I can't protect them. This may seem strange but I am sincerely already scared for a child I don't yet have... But I would love children and so would my boyfriend. Please give me some hope, or tell me what I can do to stop problems before they start. Note: I live in the Pacific Northwest, U.S. Biggest concerns: * horrific job market * even worse public school system * inability to pay for college * archaic society EDIT: Just realized I should probably add this. I'm going to work now, but I'll be back online in about eight hours or so to answer replies.	1
In Germany, at least, we have offices where people have to register as soon as they arrive somewhere and there is also a certain system of control, for example if you live somewhere, people can say yes, there are people who live very close to us, are they really registered and so on but the problem of course is when these people stay among themselves, if there are ghettos, then there is nobody who gets in there and so it is impossible. It's true that those who don't officially exist can't be counted.	0
Consumer attorneys occasionally advise their clients not to record unlawful communications due to state laws requiring both parties' consent for recording. The CFPB should require that debt collectors subject to the FDCPA impliedly consent to recording by consumers.  	0
False of misleading are rearranging paper work to suit their claims, false allegations against the lender, personal harassment, humiliation on credit reports, preventing students from seeking consolidation form other companies. Other false or misleading is the assumption that students dont want to repay their loans. That is not true. They also mix up the paper work so much it is difficult to get to the bottom of why the loans are in default in the first place. They need to streamline their services and offer students option in the private loan sector. The institutions should do the same because they treat student loans like mortgage loans.  	0
"I don't think there should be ""attorney privelege"" and that attorneys should be able to tell the court if their client admits to a charge. CMV I'm posting in CMV because I don't have a lot of knowledge in this area at all, but I hold this controversial view. I am open to learning about why this privelege exists. While I understand that a defense attorney is there to defend you, I don't see how making it illegal for defense attorneys to say when their client admits to a charge is helping anyone. People will explain this by saying, ""hopefully the courts figure out that he did it anyway, just have trust in the system"". But the system isn't foolproof, and I don't know how defense attorneys can live with themselves knowing that they are defending someone who should be charged with the crime! I don't understand the system at all. Attorneys shouldn't be forced to keep these awful secrets, and we all want the bad guys to get their proper verdict, so why have this rule? All this rule helps are the bad guys. The good guys aren't benefiting from this, because they (usually) wouldn't admit to something to begin with. This rule is only in place for the sake of ""the system"" and I don't know how good that system is.

My Constitutional rights are violated every time a lawyer fails to perform due diligence, per rule 137, BEFORE SIGNING and FILING COURT PAPER against me. The clerks are helpless, the judges & attorney disciplinary do nothing favoring ""lawyer zealousness."" I then have to spend time & money, going to court to prove I am NOT the person who owes the debt. I urge the CFPB to create mechanisms for clerks & citizens that make it 1) easier to fix these messes &, 2) to bring sanctions against lawyers & judges for MISUSE OF LEGAL PROCEDURE, ABUSE OF PROCESS, WRONGFUL CIVIL PROCEEDINGS, & MALICIOUS PROSECUTION.

Psychology uses the scientific method to try to understand the human mind, therefore it is a science. It's as simple as that. Of course there have been many many wild, unfounded, speculative theories in the history of psychology, not to mention many failed attempts at finding evidence to support those theories - but at no stage have theories been accepted as psychological fact *without* evidence. This is the key. Many people say that Economics is not a science because its theories are untestable - one can neither set up good experiments nor get good data by observing nature. This is certainly not the case with psychology. There have been many examples of psychological theories being proved/disproved by means of experimentation.	0
Yeah so what are those quotas? What are they going to be based on? I don't understand the concept. What you Thomas - you mentioned the limits. Sure. I think you're right about that. Of course, you can drive on the highway from the south from Algeciras to Germany, that's not a problem. That's clear to everybody. But people who fly into our country can be controlled. And people who are hiding in trucks should also be able to be controlled. Be it the police or the gendarmerie or the border guards, but if we don't do that, everybody will come into my house and I don't intend to accept that. And I think where something can be done, something should be done.	0
"There needs to be some federal protections for the consumer and a clear appeals process. The state run by private company programs seem to see the alleged debtor as already guilty. For example, some consumer groups have suggested that entities may not be including a ""clear and conspicuous statement"" that the consumer may dispute the validity of the alleged bad check violation. What kind of financial incentives are there for these companies to meet certain benchmarks that may not be in the consumer's best interest? It kind of sounds like those arbitration programs for credit card debt where everything was stacked in the favor of the creditor.  "	0
CA has already made great strides as to debt buyers. This should be the rule for all collectors: that when they file, they must produce properly authenticated backing for the debt sued upon.  	0
Assuming debtors have a valid address, which is some cases they do not, additional notice that the debt is being assigned to a third party collection entity is no benefit. My experience is intervention to collect by a third party normally occurs when the consumer is over 180 contractual delinquent. Furthermore, if the consumer receives the warning the account would be placed with a third party Many and more confusing to the consumer and agency.  	1
I left a long comment about one particular collector, but recently was harassed by yet another one who was trying to collect from someone else who was not me. Their caller ID was not a phone number; it was just the names of different states, but turned out to be the same company. These people are bottom-feeders with no scruples. Accurate caller ID should be required so the victim can at least identify the collector and have a call-back number for them. And monetary penalties should be much, much stiffer to discourage their outrageous, predatory and harassing practices. Harrassment is part of their business models. These people are scum and should be required at the very least to identify themselves accurately. Robo-calls and ID spoofing should be illegal with stiff fines.  	1

I have personally witnessed how judges perceive credit card debt cases, and I believe they have strayed too far towards the debt collectors. Judges simply decide whether a default has occurred, and once a judge declares a debtor in default, the adjudicated debtor has no pleading rights. Alleged credit card and student loan defaulters should have the right to declare their default an Involuntary Default and be allowed to pay back the debt with no more penalties, fees or interest rate charges, called Debt Neutrality. Debt Neutrality is making of a debt neutral so that it does not continue to indenture a defaulter in a never ending cycle of ongoing interest rate charges, penalties and fees. Involuntary defaults should allow the debtor to have the debt reset to where it was at the time of the default minus any payments made. As it stands now, Strategic Defaulters are given much better treatment than Involuntary Defaulters, in large part due to Involuntary Defaulters not being able to plead their default as being Involuntary.  	1
just took a moment longer because we were still listening to the translation. I wanted to say first of all that we have to be careful in the whole discussion that we don't lump together illegal immigration and legal immigration and[?]. that is just in Spain a completely different problem than it is with us. Because Spain also has immigrants from Africa, most of whom come to Spain illegally, whereas the problem in our country is that, as I have already mentioned, the Turkish citizens were brought here deliberately in the past and now we have problems with the after-effects, so to speak, because integration has not worked out. And what I wanted to say at the very beginning is that the problem, I don't know the prison statistics, but through my studies I know how it is in Germany, as far as the crimes of the migrants are concerned. And there is just the problem that it is always increased in comparison. But that's not because there is more criminal energy, it's mostly because... as a migrant you can commit more crimes in Germany than as a German, because there are migrant laws, migration laws, that you can violate as a migrant, while the German can't violate them at all. And this, of course, results in increased statistics, simply because more is possible in terms of volume. And you have to take that into account in any case. I don't know how it is with the prisons, that is of course a bit different, because these are harder things, but with the [...] it is in any case so that it is difficult to consider.	0

So, I want to tell you what I think. The immigrants who come to our country do not adapt to our customs. When I go to their homes, I adapt to their customs, to their traditions. But those who come to my country... And I feel obliged to adapt to their customs. And this is not normal. At least I don't consider it normal. When I go to another country, I know how to adapt to the customs of that country. If I go to the Mosque, why do I take off my shoes? If in such and such a school, why do I have to take off a cross? For me this is not normal. You adapt, you don't adapt, that's it. In any case, that's what I think.	1
... Fundamentalism in Islam. There's fundamentalism in Christianity as well. When I look at - I don't want to hurt anyone now - what the pope sometimes talks about. In Austria, the following is happening at the moment: a party, the FPÖ, the Freedom Party, a very right-wing party, is trying to use Christianity and extreme right-wing slogans to incite against Islam and partly also against Judaism. Something is happening right now that the Enlightenment, when we talked about it, has actually somehow already made us forget. This separation of religion and state is being abolished again. There is a big discussion in Austria, the Federal President is involved in the election campaign, because things are happening that are terrible. And we are no better than the fundamentalism that we accuse Islam of. Another thing about the conditions in countries like African countries, for example. I don't know exactly whether that also affects North African countries, but further south in part definitely. You also have to ask yourself what role the EU and the economy of the EU plays in the deterioration of living conditions there, for example, when food or products from Europe are sold cheaper in the countries than the products that the people there produce themselves. It is partly so that on markets in Africa products from Europe are cheaper to have, than products, which bring the native farmers or Fischer on the markets. And they earn nothing more there. Now one must ask oneself the question, they come into the misery there. Now you have to ask yourself, what is the role of the EU economy with the support of the EU in this regard? This is also a reason or can be a cause why people no longer have a livelihood and therefore try to come to Europe. Europe itself is to blame if it destroys the existence of people there, if European products are cheaper there than the local products.	1
Being in a court of law and talking to a debt collector on the phone that requires proof that the debt in question is not a valid debt, are two different things. If your intent is to sue, then sue.

I was in GATE, and I have family members that were in special ed and an aunt that still assists with special ed (not just children with severe mental disabilities, but also just slow learners) children in schools. For one, GATE classes are *slightly* harder, but at an accelerated pace as to cover more during the year. That's the difference. We didn't have more time in our GATE classes, the teacher didn't spend more time with us, it was just accelerated learning for the kids who caught onto the material faster. As for resources going towards GATE and not to other struggling children, we didn't get any more than other classes did. It was just another class with a label on it that learned at a different speed. Just like special ed classes for the mentally handicapped, it was just a label put on a class of kids that learn at a different speed. I'd even argue that special needs receive much more funding. My aunt is paid to shadow specific children throughout their day and assist them with school. That's it. A single person on the payroll assigned to different children throughout the years to help them. We didn't get that in GATE. There's also all kinds of remedial classes, tutoring programs, teachers that have specific days to stay behind for after school help, all kinds of resources a struggling child could use to catch up. I guess is what I'm trying to say is we have many resources that aren't cash sinks to help struggling children already. edit: after re-reading this it seems a little jumbled. sorry, I'm half asleep still.	1
Most Charitable Donations in the U.S. are Actually Luxury Spending. CMV. Tax-deductable charitable donations in the U.S. include giving to any one of a very broad spectrum of organizations. The missions of these organizations range from eradicating malaria and polio to funding the opera. Most charitable giving is unfortunately not anything near the best use of charitable funds to improve the lives of others. Causes are chosen selfishly by the donor, so it is really a form of glorified luxury spending. Around the world, it is surprisingly cheap to save a life. Give Well, a charity evaluation group which conducts independant research, uses $3,000 per life saved as a basic criteria for cost-effective charitable impact ( Top groups clear this hurdle comfortably. According to Give Well, the Against Malaria Foundation has saved one child life for every $2,500 it has been given, and can save one additional life for every futures $2,300 donation due to the savings it has achieved at a larger scale. Here is a breakdown of U.S. charitable donations in 2011: Of the $300 billion donated, 32% went to religious groups, 13% went to colleges and universities for education, gifts to foundations were 10%, support for arts/culture/humanities were 4%, and 3% of funds were unallocated (including carryover tax benefits and donations to government agencies). The combined total of this donation is 62% of U.S. giving, a healthy majority. Lets just take the 4% spent on the arts as a starting point. That is $13.12 billion dollars. Donated to the most cost-effective global charities, using the $3,000 per life measure, this money could be expected to save about 4 million lives. But in the U.S., we use it to pay for very talented classical musicians, visual artists, and poets to entertain the wealthy elite. Or take the college and university component. The average cost of one year of undergraduate education is over $20,000 at public colleges, and over $50,000 and private colleges (which receive a disproportionate share of donations) (source: Lets charitably assume that donations to universities actually go 100% to the core purpose of universities, and never get spent on things like athletics or fundraising costs or building gaudy structures etc. Even if that's the case, and even using $20k/year for 4 years as the cost of a college degree, every college education that these donations pay for costs the lives of about 22 people, who could have been saved by a cost-efficient use of that donation money. So how do I feel about fancy billionaires like T Boone Pickens, who donate tens millions to a unversity's football program and get rewarded with tax deductions and their name on buildings? Or ambitious social givers who spend $1000/plate on a fundraising dinner for their local opera? You can guess. Should I feel much better about the people who donate to U.S. medical causes which are maybe about 1/10th as cost effective as groups like AMF? Those causes are only 10% less wasteful than a giant donation to a college football team. So Reddit, Change My View. Convince me of any of the following: (1) Most donations in the U.S. go to relatively cost-effective groups. (2) Donations that go to grossly inefficient groups are still admirable charity and not just objectively inferior to cost-effective life-savers (note that I and Give Well both would try to give proportional credit to non-life-saving interventions like curing disability and chronic disease, etc). (3) Most donors are really trying to give to the best causes, not just selecting causes based on who has the coolest fundraising events, who is socially trendy, what improves life in their backyard instead of in some far-flung third world country, whose fundraising efforts have been most aggressive in targetting them, etc.	0
Remember that many top athletic programs are paid for by athletic foundations, not the general university fund. This means that athletics are at least partially funded by private alumni donations. In the university I support (SEC school), I make an annual donation to the athletic foundation, not to the general/alumni fund. Our entire athletic program (including facilities) is paid for by private alumni donations and profits from football/basketball. No university funding is required, thus there is no impact on tuition.	1
I think that even if everyone would give this 20% of his/her earnings for illegal immigrants and the third world countries, it will still be unrealistic because it would be a drop in the bucket. We'd be poorer, and it would not help because the money would be lost. Thank you.	0
So, the problem in relation to everything that has been asked, I find it is simply [...] political. ...] problem with Africa, for example, where we know very well that half of the elected presidents are [...] and take all the wealth out of their country. So, it is obvious anyway, how do you want Europe - yes, we could say Europe - to intervene in these countries? What it is already doing, I think. But that doesn't prevent the fact that, in any case, the vast majority of people living in Africa are in dire straits. And so the only solution for them is to leave as quickly as possible. On the other hand, it is sure that there are people, when you say, the Erasmus program [CLV] [......]. If more people would travel, if more people would go and see what's going on in the world, there would be much more tolerance.	0
Regarding the questions we were asked. When we were told that we could win everything with immigration. I'm not saying that you can win everything with immigration. It's all worth it. No. Romania has just said that there are fears of the east or west of his country. We have won with the presence of Ukrainian immigrants in particular, who have a higher intellectual base than the majority of Portuguese. So we have an added value of receiving Ukrainians in particular. So from the East, for us, it is positive. I mean, this is our life, well, this is my opinion. And I also agree with defining the rules in the EU, in general. [1 :	1
Yes indeed I believe that there should be a standardization here, a unification of legislation, of regulations. Every country has its own interests, but you have to adapt in a certain way. This also applies to immigration policy. I think that a European policy is appropriate there, because we do share this common space and the possibility for migrants to be mobile then is an important aspect. And that means that we all have to comply with European rules and so it's logical that we all belong to this same space and comply with the same rules. At least that's my opinion	0
I would like to react to what has been said, do I need to learn the language of the country to which I arrive? Has this to be the criterion? For instance within the EU, in which language shall we speak? Whether we want to impose a language of immigrant workers? This means we have to impose a Union throughout the English language? 	0
I am concerned that state and federal agencies are contributing to identity theft, big time. In just the past month I had to make an online payment on what I believe was a federal hobbs act violation by the Los Angeles building and Safety department. A day after making the payment or risk losing my home, that same credit card was being used online by thieves. Then a few weeks later another agency asked for bank documents, I supplied them via fax, and they were lost! And on top of that, there really didn't seem to be a big deal made out of the fact that the documents went missing.  	1
I find the constant updating on Nelson Mandela's condition to be ghoulish and distasteful CMV It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion. He's in hospital, oh no it's intensive care, it's gone critical, people are praying, his condition worsens... and so on. What next? headlines about how he draws his last breath? What his expression was? It's sordid imo. Why can't people wait for him to die and then report that. Why report the minute by minute progress of the dying process. My front page is full of Mandela updates. CMV I want to believe that there is something else going on and people aren't that... grisley	1

You know, Iraq or Africa, it's all very close. Even the Asian continent is not so far and the Europeans, after all, have also participated in this war, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan and earlier even, not so long ago, in the former Yugoslavia. This is, of course, a very serious political issue.	0
You forgot something. Superman is vulnerable to magic. The basic first level fire spell you tucked away in Final Fantasy whatever and forgot about? It can kill him. Whenever Superman goes up against the forces of Hell in a one on one fight, he's probably going to lose. Inside Hell? He was once written as having a complete emotional meltdown, followed by paralysis. There was nothing he could do to save anyone. Which is kind of important to him. You see, Superman asks the question - what does it mean to be good? What if you had the power to do anything anyone has ever wished to do...could you make the world a better place? And we allow him to do it, because we really wish we could. Only, he can't save the world, can he? All his powers, and his arch enemy is a guy who just knows how to work the system. Lex Luthor, has often been portrayed as just a businessman who loathes Superman because he's a God in human form. And so we have the story of an outsider who desperately wants to be our ideals vs. an insider who will use our worst instincts to tear a good man down. This is the stuff of opera and myth. Did I mention there's a love story? Lois, is a feminist. And insane. She's gloriously, wonderfully, batshit insane. How important is the truth to you? How many lives would you lose, to pursue it? What if there wasn't a Superman? How dead would she be? And she's up against....Clark Kent! Awkward farm boy, possibly autistic. Or a Buster Keaton short. It's impossible for anyone to be that pathetic, unless they're desperate to work on their stand up comedy when they're not being God and worshipped. [Being powerless as Clark Kent is all that keeps Superman from losing his empathy.]( But how powerless is he, in the information age where nerds/geeks have more social currency than ever before? That's for a better writer to answer. He badly needs updating, but he's far from lacking in potential, even now... But anyways, there's a love triangle made by two very weird people trying to figure out how to deal with each other at their worst, all the while flirting up a storm at their best. Which makes it much closer to the truth than most superhero romances....	0
I would like to know that the EU probably also pays development aid to African countries, and my neighbor put it very well earlier - and I also see it that way - people would not flee from Africa or anywhere else if they could live there. And the development aid - maybe we should pay more there, but we should make sure that some potentates don't use the money for themselves and that it disappears somewhere corruptly, so that we should control it more. But I am actually convinced that then also many people would no longer flee or would try to come here illegally.	0
I recently changed my own view on this from yours to the view that actually, I should put the seat down. My thinking was this: Men can choose to stand, or to sit. Both valid options, though many men would tell you (due to some ridiculous idea about 'masculinity' or something) that it's standing only as a guy. You can stand or sit. Sometimes, I choose to sit - it certainly minimises the risk of a disobedient member blasting the rim with piss. Women don't have that choice. Every time, they have to sit. So you're in the position of having the privelege of choice. Every time you choose to pee with the seat up, you're forcing the next occupant of that loo (if female) to put the seat back down. However, the reverse is not true; if a woman leaves the seat down, you are presented with a choice - lift it and pee standing up, or keep it down and sit (or risky option number three, pee through the reduced-area target of a down seat). It's not about empowerment or perpetuating inequality, it's about recognising that the privelege of choice is yours, not theirs - so don't be a dick. Another way to think about it - a house of 2 men will need to lift and lower the seat depending on their preferences and due to the fact that you can't poop standing up (unless you're incredibly talented). A house of 2 women will never lift the seat. So if you moved each of those people into a house together, the rule 'leave the seat down when you're done' means nobody has to change their seat awareness - the men have to raise or lower it from time to time, and are aware of that, but the women do not. Which seems, to me, to be the most fair way of doing it.	1
"Interestingly enough, they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago. It all seems logical and practical and like it should work. Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all. So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns. Then it was shotguns only. Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar. Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated. Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control. So what was the critical difference? As was pointed out, it's that your argument pre-supposes that firearms are a priviledge and not a right. You go into the creation of the list with a view that logically will lead you down this path. But let's get into each statement/idea. Because some are good, and some are not. And this isn't really abot how you set up the argument so much as the individual points. 1 - This sounds great. But this is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits. A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits (it's a hodge-podge of conflicting laws currently and some states accept others, some do not), Also, make a concerted effort to promote such permit ownership to our youths (say, training leading up to a full permit at adulthood) and as part of self-defense programs and so on. We need more firearms in the hands of good, trained citizens. 2 - Absolutely. We do this in California already to buy any firearm. But the issue again is every state has its own rules and laws. There needs to be one database and one standard for all states. I know I'm a big proponent of States rights, but in many ways, the patchwork of laws creates more headache that it's worth when we're trying to tackle a natiowide problem. 3 - Unfortunately this is completely unworkable. Given that you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands, it's never going to happen. 4 - Correct. People will just load their own or drive across town to where it's not taxed. TO make this work, it would have to be one law for the entire U.S. But then there's issues with unfair taxes vs states rights and that would simply take decades to deal with in the courts. Federal regulations are one thing, but adding an ""ammo tax"" which it would be called, is a political quagmire. 5 - We already do this with CCW permits. The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person. This also needs to be cleaned up at the Federal level. A higher level permit as you suggest would possibly let you carry in such paces, like bounty hunters and guards do. Promote this as possibly some sort of deputy corps to help out the overworked police. 6 - They already do this in most states. The issue is... wait for it... the states that don't. 7 - Unworkable, really. 8 - This is almost the law in some states already. I see no issue with it, really. As a firearm owner, your responsibility to secure it is exactly that. Fines should seem appropriate. But then again, if they steal your entire safe, it shouldn't be entirely your fault. 9 - Lastly, this is a must. A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights. When you left it up to every city and state to have different laws about voting rights, laws, police enforcement, and so on, it was a social and emotional nightmare. Only when you made it one law for everyone did we get compliance and the start of a workable system."	1
"It is mind-boggling that this has even been allowed to continue for so long. This should have been addressed years ago! Stop allowing the company to change names to continue poor practices. Stop allowing the companies to use hundreds of phone numbers to try to trick someone. Stop letting them block numbers so caller ID only shows ""unknown"" or even 000-0000. Stop putting the burden of stopping this entire industry on the consumer (who has no teeth or way to be sure the judgment is being enforced THAT IS THE JOB OF CONSUMER PROTECTION! It's in your name!

It becomes a shouting match, they say ""I'll just call back later when you are in a more 'information giving' mood,"" and hang up on me. There was/is no recourse, protection, or help for people like me.

I think what you're forgetting here is the possibility of dependence. Some people with ADHD don't take these medications specifically because they've already developed coping mechanisms to help increase their productivity. If you start on these meds young, these mechanisms never develop. This means that if they go off meds, they lose all productivity. Now a second thing to consider is this: due to the way that adderall and other stimulants interact with the brain, they create a dependency. As part of that dependency, the receptors in the the synapse get saturated, and are removed due to their redundancy. This essentially means that if you don't have ADHD and are on these drugs, you will get ADHD. So now assuming that we can supply the entire country with stimulants (which I imagine our current industry couldn't handle), once they become dependent, they essentially turn from super productive to regularly productive people, unless you increase the dosage. And if there is any sort of disruption in the supplytrain, like a natural disaster, or other problems, you suddenly have a nation of people who have severe ADHD, and have no idea how to deal with it because they haven't spent the past 30 years learning how to deal with it. If you need an analogy think of coffee. Coffee has a stimulant that people use to be more productive, and a lot of people drink it everyday. But when someone doesn't get their morning cuppa, or misses a day, they can go into withdrawal, being cranky and tired, and most likely unproductive. You say that government regulation will help, but what do you propose? Already there is an underground market for these drugs. Do you propose limiting the amount one person can buy? Then there are proxy buyers willing to sell. There will always be a way around the system. Now compared with those side effects, do we really think that the trade off for a little more productivity is worth it?	0
"I don't see any reason why single use restrooms should be gender oriented. CMV. By ""single use restroom"" I mean a public restroom with a lockable door that allows only one occupant at a time. I don't know if these are common all over the world but they are very common in the United States Now, I understand the advantages of a single use restroom. They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user. However, at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice. The most convincing argument I've read against unisex restrooms is that some people are uncomfortable urinating/defecating around the opposite sex, but this doesn't apply to single use restrooms since the occupant is alone anyway. What if there are five women in line for a single use restroom, but no men? That line of women could be moving twice as fast if they had two restrooms available. Unfortunately for them, the other restroom is only for men, so they're just going to have to hold it. This restriction strikes me as totally arbitrary. It has an obvious downside with no notable upsides that I can see. That said, I've already had /r/changemyview flip my opinion several times when I really wasn't expecting it to. Maybe there are some points I haven't considered."	0
I think I had... Sören, I would like to agree with you, and I had also said here before. We have to shift the problem from Europe to the countries. We need to build there. And once you have been to these countries, you quickly realize that every European country does its own development aid. Development aid is completely insufficiently integrated into the EU. Each country is cooking its own soup. That can't be the case. We must first start to build up agriculture there, the medical structures, the health structures are catastrophic, the infant mortality rate is 15% and medical care is only available if you pay cash, otherwise nothing, or you die. It is horrible to see. But Europe is still lagging behind and all countries have to work together and help to build up. The African countries will certainly make problems, because they have a different way of thinking. They still think in tribal terms. But I think that if all Europeans say the same thing and then keep their promises, then I think that's a reasonable way and a chance.	0
I believe that Linux is fully ready for the desktop, CMV Some of you may not get this, but I have been using Linux as a primary OS for desktops since late 2007. I hold my view because Linux does quite a bit of things: * Allows for more efficient consumption of power * Gives higher performance in general * Is a highly valuable learning experience * Is in most cases open source, allowing anyone to look at the code their systems use Please change my view.	1
We should set those illegal immigrants free, not to reward them, but because most of all, when a person like this works illegally, the profit goes to his or her employer. The person cannot afford for example: health insurance, sending children to school or some standard of living. That is why I think, they should be set free. Thank you	0
Yes, two examples of values: I think in Western Europe, for example, I take the image of women or I take the point of view of revenge, which is clearly differently formed and translated into norms in the realm of Islam and also in their peoples than in ours. I do believe that there Europe and Islam are clearly different. Thank you	0
So you don't have to be careful. I think we just need to wake up: we have missed the train, our European laws apparently create markets, just in Latin America, in Central America or in Africa, but there are differences between the countries on the spot, for example a country like Nicaragua is a very small country and at that time, we saw that in that country, the people on the spot can no longer grow rice because the country is obliged, because of a series of contracts, to buy American rice. And that is the reality. There are many examples, so we in Europe or in the rest of the world are only repeating mistakes, mistakes that finally have serious repercussions on the indigenous populations, on the populations in those countries. For example, our big companies, the multinationals, must set an example, they cannot go there to practice corruption and if they do, they must be severely punished. For example projects of multinationals that ultimately do nothing but contaminate and pollute these countries and if we have done nothing, it is our duty as citizens to denounce these facts and to really create a justice that denounces these facts.	1
"Some useful documents would be the last three collection notices ACTUALLY sent to the consumer. Too many collection agencies have claimed they sent me regular notices regarding the debt when I have not have any contact with them for 2 - 3 years. But they claim they have ""records"" that claim otherwise. Yet, there is no supporting documentation of such efforts. like say, copies of the notices.  "	1
I don't like #2 because if they were to start telling consumers to a to a certain website, that opens the door for spammers/hackers to increase virus infections by simply doing the same thing. Just calling every phone number in the phone book and telling the consumer navigate to a certain website and then infect their computer.  	0
It wasn't about persecution. We were talking here... but no, my colleagues did not talk about persecution. No, rather, a way for the Portuguese state to solve its problem differently, because the Portuguese state has a constitution, a dignity, a position in the world. As a member state of the EU. So it was not a question of recrimination of punishment. Only to grant the Portuguese state the status by which the state itself could solve its problems according to own criteria. From the constitutional point of view, it should have this right. So it was not a question of persecuting the immigrants. Or the immigrants. But to respect the commitments that each country has taken, each member country of the community has taken. [1 :	0
"Though I do not agree with ""someone to rack up tens of thousands of dollars of debt and never pay it back"". My current standing is that the laws of each and every state allow for higher interest rates to be charged for non-secured debt. This is because the lenders take more losses ""the risk should be in alignment with the award"". In many cases the principal has been paid back in full or the majority of the debt has been paid back. To allow a ""third party"" to buy it at a significantly reduced price, after the debt has been charged off by the original ""lender/creditor"" AND allow the third party to collect the full alleged balance and interest is not just. This is the way I am leaning at this time. Explain to me why you or I feel differently?  "	0
"Once I tell a debt collector I am a unpaid CareGiver and that is why I had to stop making payments, In essence they were telling me to let my parents die if necessary and go get a job. I was repeatedly baited with the comment, ""So you are a ""refuse to pay"". I found this type of conduct outside the lines of common decency. I had a business, I had to give up the business to become an unpaid CareGiver. If I had been shown at the time I apparently agreed to the credit card agreement that there truly were no ifs ands or buts in regards to monthly payments forgiveness on an ""unsecured"" debt, I would have come up with a different business model that did not require credit card debt. Credit card companies get to present themselves as pro family in their advertising when the exact opposite is true in times of crisis. Ask people who had a dramatic life changing incident occur how the credit card companies treated them. Ask the Colorado flood victims, or the Hurricane Sandy Victims, or the person who was the victim of a hit and run how the credit card companies treated them. These are the same credit card companies that lobbied the comptroller of the currency in 2002 to keep their monopoly on credit card debt suspension insurance and the outrageous overpriced premiums they were charging their customers. One of the best ways consumers had to be responsible regarding their credit card debts was having AFFORDABLE credit card debt suspension insurance. This option was stolen from consumers in 2002 when the comptroller of the currency allowed credit card companies to over charge by 1000% to 2000% on monthly credit card debt suspension insurance premiums. I created a time line document that shows how the financial elite stole fairness from the people in regards to credit card products. <a target=""_blank"" href="""">My appearance in front of the CFPB in May of 2013 and the research I shared with them.</a>  "	1
It doesn't work because of game theory. There's a famous game called the Prisoner's Dilemma (which reflects lots of real-world situations), in which you have two people. Each person benefits from being cooperated with, the benefit from not cooperating with the other person, and both people benefit more from both cooperating than from both not cooperating. In order for people to cooperate when they can't make binding agreements, they have to have the reason of trying to get their partner to cooperate in a future iteration of the game. There's a proof of this; the best way to play the Prisoner's Dilemma is to start by cooperating, and then do whatever your partner did last time. However, this breaks down if you know exactly how long the game is going to run. In the final iteration, neither person has any incentive to cooperate (since there are no more future iterations to influence), so they will both not cooperate. Since this outcome can't be changed, there's no reason to cooperate in the next-to-last round, therefore there's no reason to cooperate in the third-to-last, and so on all the way back to the first round. To avoid that problem, you need to make the resets based on something random, and make them happen suddenly.	0

I am concerned about the perception consumers have concerning older debts. With the knowledge that this legislation is both to improve debt collection practices (helping the credit industry) and to educate and protect consumers (to increase confidence and enforce their rights), this is especially relevent. Many consumers appear to be under the impression, if they haven't managed to pay off the debt within the first initial years, they should *ignore* it until it falls off their credit report. Reviving the debt is the issue. Yet these consumers are not concerned about paying the debt off in full they might be in much better financial standing now. They're concerned about how paying a debt affects their credit score. I believe this should be concerning. If a debt is outstanding, and repying part (or all) of this debt actually would *worsen* a consumer's credit, it seems counter-intuitive. It works both against the interests of creditors and debt collectors - and the interest of consumers who owe money on a debt. I don't know of a viable solution, but I'm certain this is a concern which should be addressed.  	0
Right now collectors are legally required to stop phone contact when notified by the consumer. They do not stop. And the law is not enforced. Reporting violations to regulators does nothing except get the complainant into some sort of database, and the regulators are never heard from again. There are decent laws on the books. It's the enforcement that is a failure.  	0
"If you had an illness that was not depression would you feel bad about taking medication to cure it? Or, in some cases, to just be able to live without having to many problems? Do you see a diabetic who has to depend on insulin as a drug addict? Depression is actually a pretty complex illness. You might have the same symptoms as another person and it still could be for different reasons. If you have time, read this: so, with all those different things going on in depression there are also different ways of helping people who have depression. There does not seem to be a one size fits all treatment. Different drugs try in different ways to right things that might have gone wrong in the brain. When somebody starts taking antidepressants they do not magically feel better. It often takes a few weeks for anything to set in at all. That is different to the sort of drugs you get high on, as they work pretty fast. Sometimes a person does not feel better on an antidepressant at all and sometimes they feel worse. Sometimes they feel better but the side effects are not worth it. - Alcohol always makes you drunk in a relatively predictable way, right (even though some people act different when drunk than others)? Antidepressants are not so predictable. If an antidepressant works though, that is pretty great. Mood starts to improve slowly and you start to realize things you did not even take into account before anymore. Things that are just as valid an real as what you noticed while being depressed. Yes, your friends care for you and yes, you are worth it. The person sounding all frustrated when you talk with them about how you are feeling? - They just want to help but have no idea how, they are not 'just annoyed"". - Sure, there might be no life after death, but what stops you from having one while you ARE alive? No, how you are feeling right now is not invalid and I know how frustrating it is when people just say to ""look on the bright side of life"". You see, when you are not depressed you can be sad and then you can stop being sad. Sometimes you can even make yourself stop being sad. Your friends are trying to help you, they are seeing good things going on along with the bad things and they don't know that to you everything is just somewhat worthless, unimportant, empty. You say you are depressed and they hear you are sad. So, they try to tell you that you do not need to be sad, that things are all right. (If you are like me back when I had my depression you know that there is no real big reason to be depressed and being reminded of that makes things even worse, 'cause it does not stop how you are feeling and nobody seems to realize that...) Now, is depression making you see the world more real than the ""normal"" view on life? You are talking about ""Depressive Realism"" and it is actually a thing people study. Findings are not fully conclusive and different people argue different things based on different studies and meta studies. It's another interesting read: One more thing: You remember how I said non depressed people can be sad, but also stop being sad? - When you are on working antidepressants you will also still be able to feel sad. You will not suddenly always be happy. You will be able to feel horrible if something bad happens. - But you also will be able to feel great when things happen that are great. Able to feel alive. Oh, and not all people stay on antidepressants. For many it is just a tool, a medication to help them get better, till there brain has fixed itself and can work right on it's own. I am one of those people. --- Sorry if this was a bit to rambly, I fear I might have tried to address to many points at once."	1
"I would like to see a rule prohibiting debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates from being able to pull a debtor""s credit report once the debt is officially time-barred and out of SOL. I would also like there to be a rule that specifically distinguishes between a ""hard pull"" and a ""soft pull"" credit inquiry. I have been opted out of promotional marketing via the __URL__ website for years. I do not have debt and have never had debt. What I do have is a common name,  and so from time to time I will have various debt collectors and debt buyers ""soft pulling"" my credit reports while they are trying to locate whomever they are trying to locate. This should not be allowed even if the debt is still collectable and within the SOL. No debt collector has a ""permissible purpose"" to just randomly ""soft pull"" my credit reports just because I have a common name. As far as being outside the SOL and time-barred debts: no debt collector and debt owners/debt buyers should be allowed to pull someone""s credit report  since they can't legally sue the debtor outside of the SOL. So there is no need to continue pulling someone""s credit report. As far as the ""hard pull"" ""soft pull"" is concerned: There needs to be specific language that prohibits any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates from performing ""hard pull"" credit report inquiries. The FCRA makes it clear what ""permissible purposes"" are  but it does not specifically state or distinguish between a ""hard pull"" and a ""soft pull"" credit inquiry. A ""hard pull"" is a consumer-initiated request for an extension of credit. Anything other than a consumer-initiated request is a ""soft pull."" But time and time again, I have friends, family members, and online forum members, tell me and show me that a debt collector or a debt owner/debt buyer has ""hard pulled"" their credit report. And some of these times are when the debt is time-barred from being outside the SOL and also from the Credit Reporting Time Period. This is unacceptable. A ""hard pull"" will decrease a consumers credit score and will be visible for up to 25 months to anyone who does have a legitimate permissible purpose to view that consumer""s credit report Making a ""hard pull"" on a debtor""s credit report could be a violation of the FDCPA in the privacy of the debtor. Any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates should be prohibited from doing ""hard pulls""  and the CFPB should make it absolutely clear. www.optoutprescreen.com __URL__"	1
In my opinion, based on the example of Poland[BG], specifically on the Warminsko-Mazurskie Olsztyn region, there are more immigrants nowadays especially in the trade and gastronomy and there is no crime. I do not agree with what the colleague said from Slovenia[EA] that the crime increased because of the immigrants. In my opinion, they are taking good care of the harmony and order because they care about their jobs. Thank you.	1
I think it would be important, in the country where these people come from, that they already deal with both aspects. The fact that they leave their country is already sad perhaps. But if in their own country, they could already benefit from better living conditions, it would be much better than having to leave, as refugees, to leave the whole family, to go on a very long journey and to leave in a completely foreign country. So I think that the countries of the European Union should, among themselves, focus on helping people to stay in their own country by improving the living conditions in their own country. This would avoid the need to emigrate again. I think that international collaboration is good.	0
"I may be able to change your view through actions. What is the longest period that you have abstained from porn and masturbation together? I'm currently sitting at ~12 days, and my sex drive is up. I used to be mainly attracted to women in porn, but now I feel like I want to have sex with (almost) any woman. By the way, you have a misconception regarding what NoFap is about. NoFap is about abstaining from porn, not fapping. It's *porn* that messes you up, not masturbation. You were built for (occasional) physical stimulation, but you were *most certainly not* built for porn. In one porn session, you are ""having sex"" with more women than your ancestors even saw fully clothed in their entire lifetimes. We abstain from fapping as well because fapping often leads to porn because our brains have connected fapping with porn. Once the porn addiction has been eliminated, you can begin fapping again if you want to. Porn is an addiction, and an extreme one at that. So I ask you again, what is your current record for abstience from porn and masturbation together? edit: grammar and wording"	1
That's true, because here in Germany there are now very many different nationalities living here, but it was also determined by the EU in some study that the Turks have actually been integrated the least and wanted to integrate the least. So they wanted to create their own ghettos and just came here to earn money; that was the only priority that they set - in my opinion.	1
Even when the right person is hauled into court, everything From_ill_annoy stated is still true. Defaulters should not be forced to complete the same type of court papers that those accused of crimes are required to fill out and file. Since debt collection is not considered a criminal act, filing papers should be much much easier for the defendant, and, a defendant should be allowed to plead Involuntary Default and get a better result. such as the freezing of all interest rate charges, penalties and fees in exchange for the promise to pay, even if it takes ten years.  	0
So that is the key point what you are saying Manfred. Why don't you just extend their visa? Because if someone falls out of the visa status and is treated as an illegal immigrant at that moment, then he also has no right to work and that would have to be changed so that this criminalization comes out, because before he was allowed to work with the visa. But if he suddenly gets into the mills of justice with the illegality and then he is illegal in the respective country or I'm talking about Germany, then he gets that, if he is already in the status of illegality, then he does not come back into the status of legality purely, that he can then acquire a legal visa again and that is what perhaps the EU should change times Europe-wide, This is the thing that perhaps the EU should change throughout Europe, so that one comes to a common denominator, that if someone has already worked legally and the visa expires, that he then - what do I know - so in any case does not get into illegality but simply gets into a status, as if he has not paid some fee, which he would then have to extend again. That would be easier, then we wouldn't have the numbers like that.	0
In my opinion, we should find some criteria and do a selection between the immigrants according to which the EU will keep to define which immigrants need help and which not. This system should define which immigrants we should give access to life in the EU, for example people which have a serious danger in their countries. Slovenians are ready to help people in such situations. We are ready to help other people as well.	0
"[From two days ago.]( I'm not calling it a repost, but you might find it a useful resource. Firstly, I want to know what you mean when you say you don't believe men can be raped by women, but that you *know* they can. I don't understand what it is you're trying to convey. Do you just want to know how it's possible? &gt;Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? Rape, as I'm sure you know, comes in many different forms. I don't want to actually detail methods that would cause pain, but I'm sure you believe that some sex can hurt if you're not careful. What do you think would happen if the person having sex with you doesn't care about you at all? They probably wouldn't give a shit how rough they are, or how abusive they are. So the answer is yes, unless you're talking about coercion, which is another can of worms. &gt;why can't he just... enjoy it? [...] I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc. Okay, I think I see the fundamental disconnect here. There's a social stigma that men just want sex, and if they fail to get it, they're not manly. It happens in every ""dude man bro spring breeeeak"" movie that comes out where at least one of the jokes is, some guy gets rejected by a girl. Wah-wah-waaaah. This also objectifies the girl, but we're talking about the part of this stigma that affects males. The point is, you may have the impression that men don't have as many inhibitions when it comes to sex as women do. (If you don't, I apologize for presuming, and please correct me in that case.) However, this isn't true. I've had enough sexual experience to know that sex can feel wonderful, dangerous, exciting, disgusting, and *wrong* in the bad way, depending on the incident. If someone were to coerce me into sex, or physically restrain and rape me, I would be traumatized. There's no question in my mind. To have control of such a basic part of yourself taken away with no purpose but for someone else's pleasure would probably break me. But you're not talking about emotional trauma. Rape usually isn't about just getting sex. It's about a desire to control another person. So usually female-on-male rape isn't predicated on PIV sex, but rather it might involve sodomy with a phallic object, physical abuse, and restraint, if you're looking for only the physical. &gt;A few of the comments were guys going ""what a way to go!"" and ""sounds good"" and just general positive comments. So I guess this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped. This is actually a trend that bothers the living shit out of me, but I'll stay civil. I'm sure you're familiar with Reddit's gross negligence for the worth of women when it comes to jokes and one-off hypothetical scenarios. It's like one of Reddit's main features, that in every thread featuring a woman, one of the comment threads will be about how the girl is hot, or a bitch, or whatever. But I'm sure if I were to take this to mean ""girls must be hot or bitches,"" you'd want to slap me. Remember how I said there's a social stigma that guys are only in it for sex? Some people measure the worth of a man by how appealing he is to women. That's why Magic Mike exists, for instance. So that means a lot of guys are insecure about their sexuality. Hence, the jokes. It's a mechanism for dealing with hearing of a man being raped. ""Why, if a woman wants to have sex with me, that means I'm a better man for her than other men! How can being raped by a woman be so horrible? Doesn't that just mean she wants me really bad?"" They just can't understand what it's like because *they don't have to deal with the fear of that happening*. Sex is a goal for the stereotypical male, not a vice. With women, it's different. Sex is forbidden, an exotic gift only given to the one that woman has chosen. To take it unduly is a horrible thing because it's so important to her. Notice that this last point is actually completely correct -- it's just not considered as important for men, because the stereotypical man has sex with multiple people over his life, and it's not that big a deal. Basically in basic human society (and going back to before recorded history, in fact) the girl sticks with one guy, but guys get around. We live in a modern society now, where that idea does us no good and perpetuates a culture where sexism and that sex-based concept of worth can only ever be harmful. Sorry for the ramble, but I hope I've addressed some of the underlying conceptions you might have that cause you to be so conflicted. Let me know if I'm way off base."	1
In many districts where bad check diversion programs exist, there is anecdotal evidence that the companies administering the programs threaten with prosecution individuals who do not come within the state's bad check law for example, checks that bounce due to printing errors, checks for which there were funds available when written but not when presented, and individuals who pay the amount due by other means within grace periods permitted by state law. The CFPB should ensure that bad check diversion programs have a realistic means of ensuring that only individuals realistically subject to prosecution are targeted, and should also require that, in order to qualify for the 1692p safe harbor, diversion programs prohibit misleading communications and misstatements of state bad check law.  	0
"I'll keep it short. That personal don't-care-what-they-think indifference is great; it'll keep you stable through interactions with obnoxious people and it will give you an admirable air of confidence in your personal and professional relationships. That said, don't take it too far. The funny thing about relationships with people (and we're talking friends and contacts here, not just SOs) is that they're actually difficult to maintain. You have to generally make some effort to set time aside, call folks you haven 't seen for a while, and set up activities. Going bowling, going drinking, going shopping, whatever it is you do with people - it's not going to ""do itself"". What that means is that you're sort of copping out. You're taking the easy, lazy route through your 20s by letting your relationships lapse because you simply don't need them right now. You're doing the minimum amount of work to maintain the level of social interaction that you currently desire instead of maintaining contact with people.... And here's the important part. You might not need a lot of people in your life right now, but some day, you *will*. I'm not talking about just getting lonely. The bigger your network is, the more opportunities for jobs, romance, and entertainment you have. The more often you interact with people you consider friends, the better you get at being friendly. If you let your network dwindle to two friends and they both decide to move, you're going to be a very lonely person on very short notice and you're not going to have the skills to do anything about it. Friendship skills are just like programming languages or knitting: Don't use it for a few years and you won't remember the finer details. Let those skills atrophy and some day you're going to find yourself alone, unemployed, and *really* wishing you had some people to call. When you see people moving up in their career with opportunities banging on their doors, you're going to wonder why no one's offering you your next job. Keep up with people. The older you get, the more you'll want people who knew you when you were younger. Cutting ties by attrition is a terrible, terrible plan at this point in your life."	0
As I said earlier, to put oneself in opposition, when I spoke about language earlier, is, as Monique said, effectively, more and more on the community side, this building it up?

I too, do not answer calls with no name, no number or 800 numbers. After over a year of unemployment and only able to get part time work, I had to give up my landline. I get repeated unknown calls on my cell, even though all creditors were sent written notices not to contact my cell number. I'm almost at a point that I cannot afford my cell, but if it give it up I have no way to get contact from a potential employer. When I get a full time job I will gladly pay my debts, but constant calls will not get the debt paid any faster. Not one company called me to give the the credit, so they should not call my cell and cost me more money that will prolong them getting paid. Besides, most of the calls are robo-calls with no message ever being left so I never know who the call is for.  	1
Dear CFPB: I hope you will separate the comments about debt buyers from those about debt collection in general. This is another area where you should throw the book at collectors telling deliberate lies or misrepresentations. On the other hand, there are too many federal suits brought by consumers who were not misled but who allege that the least sophisticated consumer might have been misled by a letter written in good faith. The only ones who benefit are attorneys. The CFPB has power under UDAAP in addition to the FDCPA to punish liars. They should use it. Collectors, who are just lay people in most cases should not be held to a strict liability standard. Punish bad actors but restore reasonableness to the act.  	0
They need to include the name of the original creditor as well as the account number and the brand name the consumer would recognize. Date and amount of last payment, copy of the last billing statement (supposedly) sent to the consumer. However I also think they need to send a copy of the original debt document with the consumer's signature. Someone can send me bills for something I don't owe, but they can't send me a signed paper I never signed.  	0

I just wanted to add to their thought. I would recommend a self-help like that and I think that would be the very best thing. That would help everybody and you could also have these countries - I don't see it as blackmail either - if you control where the money goes. That's certainly not blackmail, that's what we do everywhere, so also in Germany, if I donate something somewhere, then I also want that the money really arrives there and not that it ends up in some account somewhere and is really hoarded in Switzerland. So I just wanted to confirm that, that thought	0
"You're argument is basically one of semantics. I mean, I could say ""My religion caused me to do X"" or I could say ""I did X for a religious reason"". I'm saying literally exactly the same thing, but only the second doesn't work in your opinion? Maybe, a better way or saying it would be that you don't think religion or faith should be used as evidence for an assertion. That means something quite different than what your post entails, but it would probably be more accurate."	0
In theory this seems like a reasonable policy, but how can collectors know where a debtor is if they are calling his or her cell phone? Knowingly calling third parties should be prohibited across the board. It is no one else's business what goes on between creditors and their debtors. Calls to a person's boss or family can cause further financial and domestic problems, neither of which will help with getting the debt paid.  	0
"So in that situation, let's set strict rules about whether we count immigrants. We need to know how many there are. How many legal and illegal immigrants we have. We don't know in France, we don't know, it's just that in France it's forbidden to count. We don't know in France how many blacks, how many Muslims, how many Catholics, how many Protestants; it is constitutionally forbidden. So from that moment on, you assume, when you assume you cannot establish anything valid. So, if we introduce a ""Green Card"", like in the United States, for example, someone who is going to come to France must have a card that is valid for one or two years, with a job, with an employer, that could eventually lead to something that can be controlled. But to dream that we will arrive at a situation where immigration is zero, we should not dream, especially since France is likely - as you know without a doubt - to have all the countries of the Maghreb and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa where these people arrive by tens of thousands tolerated. So there are areas, places where in France we call them non-environments, the police never enter, so that's in 2009, in a country so culturally high that France and the French don't know too much. So there, that's the situation today."	1
I agree with a majority of what you said, but you said they are **only** concerned with views. When you make absolutes such as that you are likely wrong. Views is obviously an important factor. If you do not get many views you will have a hard time continuing. Without a large amount of viewers your ads will bring in less revenue and ultimately lower the profits of the company providing the news. This will possibly cause the company to go out of business or stop providing news. We can look at this regarding news casters on TV. It tends to be during the morning / afternoon it is more hard news while in the prime time there are more opinion shows. Why? Because people watch news more at night and they like bias and sensationalized news. If more people wanted hard news then there would be more hard news rather than opinion.	0

CMV The US army [requires]( push-ups sit-ups 2-mile run men 40 50 16:36 women 17 50 23:06 What rational justification can there be for excluding a man from the military who can meet the female standards but not the male standards. If fitness requirements serve a functional military purpose, why should a man who can do only 20 push-ups in a minute be rejected while a woman at the same level would be adequately fit? If certain levels of fitness are required for the job, why should women get a handicap? Is the purpose of the fitness requirements to reward people who are relatively fit for their peer group or to serve functional goals?	0
"A marital spouse is no longer a marital spouse when either martial partner dies. To death do us part. The end is death. A spouse doesn't remarry while still married, but unmarried people will remarry. A divorced spouse or a widowed spouse, may become the spouse of another once remarried. The term spouse, in my opinion, relates to a marriage. Once the marriage is over, the ""spouse"" is no longer a ""spouse."""	0
"It really depends on how you read the news. I myself have a google newsfeed, and I scan it a few times a day to check for a tailored set of developments that I think could actually influence the world's overall status quo. Science, world events, BBC, Technology, major business stories, and major US politics. Things I have specifically banned from my feed: any celebrity story of any kind. ""One weird trick"" Health stories. ""Weather happened and it killed 2 people"" stories. My goal is to see how the world, as a whole, is developing. I use the incoming information to piece together political trends, scientfic discoveries that matter, and public opinion changes. It requires concentration, creative thought, and a logical mind. It's also a lot of fun. TL;DR I agree with your point, but only for sensationalized news stories. Looking at history in the making is a lot more fun."	1
There should never be a fee for payment. In fact, in about 1/3 of the states have state laws that prohibit any fees/surcharges for payment by credit/debit cards (unless it is a government agency). if a debt collector accepts credit/debit cards for payment, there should not be any fees for payment processing. Nor should there be any fees for payment processing for any other payment method for that matter. debt collection companies should also be able to accept prepaid debit cards for payment as a means of privacy and security for the debtors, rather than access to a bank account.  	0
So there you go, we see, Björn, okay you're right, that's good but to finish, this problem of integration no matter what country and people have to be ready to want if some people are avoided to come and they don't want to react, it won't be anything. No, they are welcome but they should also - they should be able to speak the language a little bit and they should be able to discuss more or less, they should be able to adapt to the situation more or less. And so they should be able to adapt a little bit because if not, we won't make it and so we come to the point that has already been discussed that is the creation of ghettos and that in these ghettos - and I don't know where you live - and so maybe - I don't know if you live in a ghetto, I don't know. I've always had good contacts with those people but certainly also other examples with bad examples, with bad experiences : it's also an anxiety that is created, it's not the anxiety in front of immigration, it's rather the anxiety in front of a violence in front of people who - sometimes the look already kills, sometimes the look is already hurtful and so it's him who has to work that, I have been to Africa myself and it is there that we must intervene with the ministers and so on, so that the European Union acts at that level, at the ministerial level, and creates the basis for these people to be able to stay in their countries at that time. Those who come could be better prepared before they come and then they will also be able to live with us and be able to live with us so that we can live together and that it works 100 percent.	1
"I too am a family member of a consumer who claims to have paid his debt of 12 - 15 years ago, but my husband and I receive two or three calls a day asking for him to call various agencies about a ""matter"" with a case #.

They should not be allowed to call anyone other than the debtor who nowadays can be found on the internet!!!  "	1
There are certainly from country to country within the EU bigger or smaller problems with illegal immigration. If I think about the south, I don't know about Greece, but we know about Italy and Spain. That they have very, very big problems with it. So, it would also be in the sense of the European Union, if those who have less problems, support those who have more problems. That would be my thought.	0

I think the Massachusetts rule is a positive step in the right direction, and would be better than the current situation. However, for those debtors who truly cannot pay at all, due to a serious adverse life event, such as the loss of a job due to a medical disability, their situation is not likely to change from week to week. For example, most disability insurance companies only require a patient's doctor to submit a re-certification of the patient's medical disability every 3, 6, or 12 months. In essence, the debt collector would be acting as a sort of medical re-certification investigator twice a week, which is unnecessary, burdensome on both debtor and collector, and potentially harassing.  	0
I think that we have an interesting variable here, but first of all I would like to respond to that. I think that, in the end, we should not abandon the meaning to anyone, whether French or Spanish, we are all here to give another opinion and pose a problem. Immigration is obviously an enrichment of cultures, but obviously within certain limits. Today in Spain, this is not the case. There is a lot of immigration. So you ask why they come if you are not able to give them work or food? So I don't know how you do it in France, maybe the immigration in France, look at the Spanish, the Italians, of course at the time, we left in the host countries with a work contract. So there you go, you sign a contract and if you don't you can go back home. So you had to adapt directly and pass a very strict medical examination [?]; if you were not in good health, you were not admitted. So I understand my colleague [GL], but that doesn't mean that you are against immigration, that you don't consider immigration to be an enrichment. But now, if immigrants should adapt, without forgetting obviously their culture, but it is necessary that by the working hours, at school, etc., they should adapt to the rules of the country, maybe with the exception of Saturday and Sunday. So I'm not asking to erase their culture, but they have to adapt to the rules, as we all do, and obviously everyone has to pay their taxes like everyone else. And the words that you [JP] introduced, I think it's true that these are the best ones that come up in the end and it's a bit of a shame, something should be done. I don't know what, but it is true that they impoverish their country of origin in this way. That's all.	0
I have not encountered a situation in which the bill collector is hired by a business for many decades now. Usually the debt collector has bought the debt, usually for pennies on the dollar, from the original creditor. I also disagree that the law provides a way for consumers to steal from businesses. If anything, I would say we have become in danger of reverting to the tyranny of Dickens' time, where a person and that person's family, including children, would be imprisoned for debt. Surely we can agree on reasonableness when it comes to how we treat each other, whether debtor or creditor?  	1
I was following the advice of our bankruptcy attorney. I was allowed to tell creditors only a limited amount of information. I could confirm- my identify, that yes I owed the debt, and third that I was not able to start repaying my debt. No I was not allowed to tell the debt collectors that we would be filing bankruptcy. It took almost six months to complete tasks prior to notifying creditors about the bankruptcy. During that time I was subjected to verbal abuse, threats, illegal intimidation tactics, and outright lies. The tape recorder completely stopped the bad behavior. It's amazing what debt collectors will say and do when they call debtors. It's a totally different story what they want recorded. The best money you will ever spend is a cheap $20-25 telephone tape recorder.  	1
I am all for consumers right protection but when you see CFPB, FDCPA and other law they are all to make it difficult for collection agencies to do their honest job. But there is never a talk about consumers responsibilities. I agree that some collection agencies are aggressive. but I think a good honest collection agencies also need their rights to do honest work.  	0
I will be brief. Two countries compared with natural resources and other two countries with very recent immigrants. The United States and Brazil. The difference between Brazil and the United States is the organization and the efficient policy. The United States in comparison with Brazil are two countries that welcome immigrants. With the influences, the Italian community and other communities. But I think that the secret, the solution is to adapt more effective policies of immigration control. And I think that's the basis. The foundation. People move to seek a better standard of living, more money, obviously to continue to grow their families. And so that the country must pay to be able to receive these people with quotas and I think that only with quotas can we control the flow of immigrants. And to avoid illegal immigration. We know that this immigration is hidden in a hypocritical way. We must find a solution for this situation.	1
Yes, more immigrants are coming to Slovenia and the effects of this immigration are such that economic crime has increased. This is a strong tendency, increasing economic crime.	1
I believe that it should never take more than a few hours the night before an exam to study. CMV I have heard many people talk about how students shouldn't wait until the night before an exam to study and I have seen many of my friends study for over ten hours for a single exam. I do not understand why doing this is necessary. The purpose of an exam is to quantify how well students understand material that has already been taught. Everything that an exam covers, the students are expected to already have learned through lectures, reading the book, homework assignments, labs, etc. At the point that a student is studying for an exam, all of the information they need, they should already know. It is my understanding that the purpose of studying is to refresh your memory and recall details about things you learned a month ago that you had since forgotten. If that is case, it shouldn't take more than a few hours to do.	1
"I work in an art gallery. You'd be amazed at how much crap there is pre-1950s that manages to survive. There were big trends of ""artists"" who pre-painted torsos and then hastily painted their client's heads on top, because it was a quick way for the average joe to make some decent money without much talent. Half of these guys didn't even bother painting a coherent hand. There will always be amateurs, con artists, and plain art you don't like screwing up what you would otherwise consider a great era. Also, you seem to have an issue with 1970s abstract expressionism and are using it to represent all contemporary art. There is a lot of fantastic stuff out there today, but as with all kinds of creations, most of it will be crap or stuff you don't like. I wish I was on my home computer so I could browse my collection of contemporary art and show you some of my favourites. For now, pick up an issue of Juxtapoz or Spectrum 21 to see the kind of cool things that are happening right now. Some I picked up just from a quick browse of Juxtapoz's website: [David Mach's coat hanger sculpture] ( [Chiharu Shiota's installations]( and [Stephanie Clark's embrodiery]( It's worth pointing out a lot of contemporary artists are now doing things on larger scales or with materials that cannot be properly represented online (eg video, the texture of string, illusions that can only be felt from a certain perspective in the room). If you're not regularly setting foot in galleries, you're missing a lot of great stuff."	1
Additionally, collectors should not be allow, under ANY circumstance, to use any method which would cost the conusmer money. For example, cellphones and texting should be banned completely from calls from collectors.  	0
My approach was just that -it has to be granted a visa, a green card, blue card, whatever, first of all, that someone is allowed to work here at all. I actually had a second thought, like a kind of probationary period, that you say, first someone has to come to see if he can find work here, and then to say, a certain period of time X, and then to say, if an extension comes, it should be unlimited. So not from the outset, because ultimately the statement was, if someone comes, he should automatically get an extension, that means for me, it is from the outset an indefinite residence permit and from there, so it is only a refinement of what you just said, then to say, once temporary, then a decision fits it and then for ever.	0
So I think that in the discussion that we are having around this table we have to distinguish between those that we need, for example skilled workers, scientists, computer scientists that we need to be able to survive from a technical standpoint. But on the other hand obviously there are those people who have no qualifications, who do not master the language of the country of arrival and there we really have to make a clear cut because it is not the same thing at all.	0

"Consumers normally are unaware that their debt has been sold to a collection agency. They, one day, get a call about the debt from someone unbeknownst to them. The collection agency wants the consumer to remit the payment to them, when actually, principal on the debt never decreases because the collection agency gets their cut (commission) off the top. The debt is there essentially, forever with added late charges, interest and other penalties. I submit to the CFPB to finalize the ""Know Before You Owe"" rule and to outlay the debt validation rules so that consumers can make an informed choice before wasting their money on a debt they may not owe.

"Can I respond? This argument is right. It's true that we're going to have a sort of ""Brian drain"" as we say. So we're going to take the best from the other side. I am in favor of selective migration, the reason being that we can only let people come here if they have a future here. If that means that people who come here will not find a job, will not be accepted in the labor market. And they will have to depend on a social benefit, then they will not have a good life either. So we should not do that to them either. And so that's why I would still be for selective migration."	0
What Marije said is true. But I think that it will also be necessary to make a part at the level of the member states. I think that it is a mixture of the two that is necessary and that will remain necessary. Because to say that it is totally at the level of Europe that we settle this, I think at this moment the member countries will not collaborate. However, in politics this is often the case. Pretending is good. I think that Europe can provide for certain laws, but the member countries must also be able to do something about it in the country itself, otherwise in the end they have nothing to say at the time of the elections etc. For Africa, I can understand, that this must be regulated at European level. But how do you do it in Europe, even with the member states? There is a large part of borders that are open and they arrive in masses from there. And for example for the Polish population that lives in the Netherlands, and the economy suddenly goes well and now they are all still in the Netherlands. In spite of all. And the Netherlands have to pay them for the blows that this causes. How will this problem be solved?	0
So what we could perhaps do is launch an appeal to the European Parliament so that they start to really develop a policy in this area. Because we have noticed that in practice there is no policy and so we need to create a common platform and so this should really be one of the main priorities because now they are all talking but nobody really dares to intervene. So it has to be a really big priority and maybe one day a solution will be found and then for me also this situation in the document, so a big priority is that the different countries can also increase the fines given to the employers who don't have illegals, so stricter fines, this would be the solution. So obviously now there's a lot of people who are paid half or a quarter of what they should be, there's no social contributions that are paid and so on so the state should intervene more rigorously so that it's really strongly limited.	0
Safe spaces aren't really created to hide people from other view points, after all, almost all of the people in these groups have to adjust to and communicate with people who have opinions other than their own in their everyday lives. There are a couple reasons why safe spaces can be very beneficial. Here are a few that I can think of off the top of my head. 1)Many of the people in these groups actually *have* either experience physical or emotional abuse as well as loss of jobs, relationships with family/friends, and social status, or been threatened with it. For instance, my university has a confidential program (safe space) for people who think they might be LGBT but are questioning or can't come out for various often times very serious reasons. The people who go to that group are already in an emotionally and socially vulnerable position in which speaking up in front of people who oppose them could be not only absolutely traumatizing in itself, but also potentially life devastating. On this same train of thought, many groups have such a history of being oppressed or abused by another group that this fear becomes omnipresent even when an individual has not been *openly and directly* threatened or abused. For instance, [this study]( shows that women are 75% less likely to speak up in a space when outnumbered by men. This means that bringing men, especially men who might vehemently disagree with what they are saying, into a safe space means for all intents and purposes shutting the women in the group up. 2)The purpose of most safe spaces is not form a space that people spend all of their time lingering in and closing off from the world, but rather to find a group of other people who share common experiences who can give you advice, comfort, and reassurance. By the way, it is not only safe spaces that do this, but many different types of groups. It would be inappropriate to waltz into a church during services and proclaim why their religion is wrong, or walking into a sports bar during the Superbowl trying to tell people that sports are stupid and a waste of time. When people come together over a common interest/experience they are looking to find enjoyment and camaraderie, not to argue. Just because people participate in these type of group events doesn't mean that the church goer or sports fan wouldn't be open to other viewpoints at another time; it simply means that in this one event or space they are not looking to battle their views out with another. Likewise, people who participate in safe spaces are still open to discussion in other circumstances, but want the occasional comfort of and support of a group who understands them. After all, most members of safe space groups live in societies which are not as receptive/encouraging of their views every day, so it isn't as though they are hiding from the world entirely. 3) Most of the rules and guidelines that define safe spaces are just to get people who typically feel shut down in normal conversations/debates for their views/sexuality/race/gender/whatever are able to express their viewpoint. Many people that I know are comfortable in their beliefs about something, but are too shy, insecure, fearful of being ostracized to be able to argue them to others, but they still need some outlet for their thoughts/feelings. Whilst I think you and I both likely best communicate and explore our ideas through debate, some people can't because they feel attacked through this method of discourse, especially people who are members of groups who have been/are being systematically dismissed in society. Participating in a safe space gives those people the cathartic opportunity to say how they think/feel and hopefully even gain enough confidence through the encouragement of the group to express their views in the more public way you desire. In this way, **safe spaces can actually be beneficial to the creation of meaningful dialog**. I hope that helps a little :)	0
Off the top, I believe NYC has similar laws where business are not allowed to charge extra for the use of credit cards however it seems online payments to the city (taxes, water bill, traffic ticket, etc) using a credit card are still assessed a processing fee. It seems NYC itself is confused about this.  	0
I think with this whole asylum policy and immigration policy you must not forget that the fishing grounds of Africa are still being fished out by Europeans and Americans for an apple and an egg and with our subsidy policy we are not so gentle on many markets in Africa - so we deal with it. I think you have to take all that into account. I mean, some of them are really dying of hunger, and I think that a little less subsidy, in my opinion, for some things, then the market in Africa would not be so destroyed, whether it's clothing or chicken legs. You can't forget all that either. And if I have no other choice, if everything is still being taken away from me, I don't know, from the - whether it's uranium or gold mines or whatever, and everything is being ruined. Who wouldn't walk away from that? I mean, basically, we always have migratory movements, so by and large. I look at it a little bit differently.	0
I would like to react to what my neighbor said. We need immigrants for the demographic problem. We need more and more old people, in Europe we need a lot of people. It is true, yes. But then we return in the old error that we have already committed in the past, of term of ecology. We need so then good, they can come what. Then come people who come in and that's when we'll have a group that doesn't want to work, for example, as you say, and if we see the percentage that doesn't want to work and we see the percentage of natives that don't want to work either, I think those numbers are pretty similar. I even think that among the natives, there are more people who do not want to work than among the immigrants. And I remain of the opinion that as Europe, and that is why it is necessary that it is really a European policy and not by country as it is done at the moment [...], because otherwise we will never get out of it. It is at the European level that we need a policy. The donor countries, if I can call them that, I will call them Africa. If underneath they are under the economic plan, and that has a development there and that ourselves, we solve our demographic problems ourselves.	0
Me I'm not against immigration at all but I think we also need to provide a life outside the borders of Europe. Allow these people to have a base outside the European Union so that they can stay at home. Because if it were the other way around, if we didn't have a future for our families in Europe, I think we would do the same thing and try to immigrate as well. So what we need to do is put clear demands on the politicians in the European Union, so tell them: give something to these people, for example in Africa so that they stay there, try to bring up the economy there and so on, build businesses .	0
Filing suit in the state that the consumer lives in is the most practical. If a state has a large district there is nothing that can be done unless judges want to allow tele-conferencing,, or phone conferencing. However, if that is allowed it should be allowed for both sides provided the evidence of the debt is supplied to the court in advance.  	0
In fact, we have recently had many examples where the executives earn more and more - and the richer they are - more and more, and the poor earn less and less. And the politicians in particular also place a high value on this, so how could we get them - the politicians - to think about the other, the more modest people, the workers, employees? How could that be realized?	0
In a week, I turn 22. I don't see any reason to look forward to any particular birthday for the rest of my life. CMV When you are in your teens and young adult years in the US, there are plenty of birthday milestones to look forward to. At 16, you can get a driver's license. At 17, you can go see R rated films in theatres. At 18, you are a legal adult and can do many things like buy tobacco, vote, get into some clubs/bars/venues, and at 21 you can buy alcohol. But what comes next? I now basically have all the legal and social freedoms that I will ever get, and I cannot think of any particular milestones that I would want to look forward to. Some might say the age when I am able to retire and collect social security, but who knows what that will be like by the time I actually get to that age? (I also don't like the social security system, but that's a debate for another day). I also hope that I make a career for myself that I love enough to not want to retire as soon as I'm able to, so that's another reason why I wouldn't really look forward to that. So please, change my view! I'll probably be away from the computer for an hour or so, but I'll be back later to reply to people.	0

Possibly the most egregious action of all regarding credit card debt occurred in 2002, suspiciously close to the 911 aftermath. While insurance companies were paying out tens of millions of dollars to building owners who suffered damage because of 911 (which technically they should not have done since this was an act of war which is NOT covered by most insurance plans), the comptroller of the currency was DENYING insurance companies from competing with credit card companies in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena. The result was a credit card debt suspension insurance monopoly for the credit card companies with premiums that were overpriced by a factor of 1000% to 2000% The profit margin was so high for credit card debt suspension insurance that the CFPB actually had to fine the credit card companies OVER 500 MILLION DOLLARS in the summer of 2012 for overly aggressive credit card debt suspension insurance sales and marketing practices. I had warned about overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance back in 2008 with the creation of www.credit-protector.com but was never compensated for my efforts. It meant that MOST credit card defaults in the United States over the last 10 to 15 years were based on a fraudulent foundation of obscenely over priced credit card debt suspension insurance that consumers could not afford to keep purchasing. Consumers were literally paying for 5 years worth of credit card debt suspension insurance but only receiving 3-5 months worth of coverage! Most of the times that a judge was declaring a credit card default, they were propping up the overpricing of a monopolistic credit card debt suspension insurance policy that did not fairly give consumers the most obvious way to protect themselves from a default that was caused by life changing event We could literally fix the U.S. economy almost overnight by doing the right thing. First acknowledge credit card debt suspension insurance fraud that the credit card companies have perpetrated on the american people over the past 10 to 15 years and as retribution reduce all consumer credit card debt by approximately 65%. Then raise the monthly minimum payment on the remaining 35% from 2% to 5% so the monthly payment remains roughly the same but consumers feel their debt more easily going forward. The comptroller of the currency tried to get credit card companies to raise their monthly minimum payment requirements from 2% to 4 or 5% back around 2005 but relented when it became obvious too many people would default. By reducing consumer credit card debt by 65% as a form of reparations for debt suspension insurance fraud consumers suddenly have a lot less debt BUT still have to make a similar monthly payments. However MORE of that monthly payment goes towards paying down the actual debt rather than the cesspool known as ever expanding interest rate charges.  	1
In my opinion, we should perhaps think of methods of stimulation programs, to stimulate them to adapt to the European community. And not to throw stones at them and push them and force them. Because we will only train them and stir them up against us. They will keep coming and they will have more and more hatred against us. But they will always come. Trying to chase them away will only increase their numbers. I think an effective approach would be to make them happy and glad they came and make them willingly submit and make a contract. So I want to willingly go to a state, submit to its laws, work, and have a better life. The life I wished to have. So if the alternative is that - if things don't work out the way I want, I choose to go to some state but I don't have the legal, formal ability to go there. So I choose to go illegally. I subject myself to risks. And why? Because I want to go to that state because I believe that there, only there I will find a better life or the things that I am looking for. Maybe there are other suggestions, other opinions.	0

So at the risk of embarrassing myself in terms of numbers now: Just as an example, if I have followed the dossier correctly, so if we now mean specialists in general comes to mind a number with specialists if in Germany last year 3,800 specialists have migrated to the European and also non-European foreign countries, then I ask myself how I then create for a specialist who I let immigrate perhaps from any other country, the incentive to stay with us, if the others see the incentive rather to go away.	1
Making voting compulsory is a ridiculous idea for two reasons. Firstly, it would be monstrously expensive to enforce such a law. I have no idea how you'd even do it in the first place, and even if a system were devised, I have no interest in supporting such a thing with my taxes. Of course, the more pressing issue is that many people simply don't care (a topic for another CMV perhaps), and their votes would skew the election. For example, a decent fraction of the country votes in the presidential election because even if you don't take a particularly active interest in the candidates, you hear enough through news outlets, social media, and word of mouth to develop an opinion. The legitimacy of the information you receive is questionable, but you at least know something about each candidate and you use this information to make a decision. On the off chance that this information doesn't intrigue you, you make the decision to not vote at all, and the election can be decided by people who do care. By the way, the right to vote, just like freedom of religion, should certainly include the right to not vote just as a person can choose to not follow a religion. What about senatorial elections though? Do you even know who your representatives are for the state you live in? Most people don't and forcing those people to vote in an election involving politicians they know nothing about is an awful idea because their votes will essentially be probabilistic noise. Between two candidates, the uninformed voters will split 50/50 thus diluting the voters whom actually care. Should we be more involved in our voting system in this country? Sure, but forcing people to do so is not the solution.	0

I had the same situation with another cellular carrier. It seems it's a ploy to keep making the debt seem fresh. It was another early termination fee, and I wrote many letters before it was finally removed from my credit report. I think that the tactic of selling the same debt to keep it on a credit report definitely should stop. It is one debt, and there is a time limit for how long it stays on one's credit report. One way to keep track of this is to require people to be notified if a debt is sold. It is required when a mortgage is sold. It seems like a no-brainer. The rules should also be written to discourage -- no, to bar -- collections companies from passing around debt for the purpose of keeping it on credit reports.  	1
According to Sasha’s comments, we could refer the subject of war. Mainly because this whole budget which goes to maintain military and other not necessary things could go to help immigrants. Here we would have a good starting point in providing them with assistance.	0
"I would like to see the CFPB address the issue of their ""phishing"" expeditions , i.e., trolling the phone listings and calling anyone with a similar name. I was listed by my initials, but with a common last name, I was getting daily calls from debt collectors until I switched my listing to a nickname. There are many comments on this site from people having the same problem, so it's obviously a common practice. For some strange reason, the folks in the phone centers, react badly when I ask them to explain how my phone number ended up being programmed into their robo dialer. The usual response has been to hang up on me. I would also like to see the CFPB address the issue of repeated calls to the wrong person. If I'm not the person of interest on the first call, then I won't be on any subsequent calls. In my experience with debt collectors, I have reached the conclusion that their are two reasons for repeatedly calling me: The people in the call centers are trained not to take No for an answer. By calling me repeatedly the debt collector is trying to wear me down and get me to pay a debt that isn't mine just to get them to stop calling.  "	1
This kind of thing is likely determined by family court law in the jurisdiction where the debtor lives. Community property law, divorce or separation agreements and issues of domestic violence laws all come into play in these kinds of circumstances.  	0
But we should not forget about the Holocaust and the Second World War. We should recall the Jews’ problem in Germany. We should remember such tragic examples. They were not immigrants but a religious minority. They were people that have been living there for a long time. They had to be destroyed, exterminated…	0
To avoid consumers getting sued repeatedly on the same debt, the CFPB should require or encourage states to adopt rules requiring that judgments be preclusive of future consumer-collector litigation on the same debt; instead, if there is a dispute between assignees as to who has title to the debt, they should work it out between themselves instead of risking subjecting the consumer to multiple liability.  	0
I have never been deliquent on my State taxes. Due to an error made by the company I worked for in 2008, which didn't take out taxes, I am now faced with dealing with the State Collection agency. I have never heard of the State threating the residents to try to collect taxes. I called and coopertaed, however, the callers are harassing me from morning to night. I have excellent credit and have worked for many years to maintain my credit standing. I have never owed Federal taxes that I have not agreed to pay. And never in my life owed State taxes and I am shocked that they can hound the residents like private collectors do. I am retired and and on a fixed income. For the State to be able to threaten the residents who are making attempts to pay the taxes, (one year) seems like a violation of rights.  	1
I do personally believe in an afterlife, however, I cannot prove it so I am not going to try to argue it. But the reason why we are so driven to have sex is because our genes, our animal instinct wants to reproduce. It almost needs to. One may argue that the reason we have this desire to procreate is so that a piece of us does live on after we're gone. Our genes are still being passed on. A piece of my great great great great grandparents is still in me. My daughter looks almost exactly like me. Our things can easily be destroyed, but our genes are essentially immortal.	1
I don't know if you can regulate it well, how many people immigrate or emigrate or whatever. I think it's important to create a basis for all people to be able to live in their country. Because I think that is actually the main cause. That many industrialized countries are bleeding small countries or poor countries dry and taking away their livelihood. And that's why people emigrate, because they no longer have anything to eat, because they can no longer find work in their country, and because life in the industrialized countries is simply made out to be nicer or better. In order to be able to ultimately prevent an immigration policy, illegals, I believe that you first have to change the basis in the other countries, that is, the countries of origin. Create a basis. Life base.	0
"If a consumer states that he disputes the debt, the debt collector should immediately cease ALL collection activity until the debt is validated. And, by validation, it needs to be more than ""the name and social security information matches the creditor's records. The validation process should include a clear and complete copy of ALL DOCUMENTS that create the alleged obligation. If none is available, then the debt should be cancelled.  "	0
I think that the motivation of the people who arrive - should we actually ask the immigrants if they are motivated to come to this country or to another country? Because if they are motivated, we can ask them for their data and then bring them back so that they can increase their skills and offer them training. But it must be a choice of the immigrant who arrives and who has chosen the country where he arrives or is welcomed, so that he can be well in the country because sometimes he arrives by default and I think that is where there is a failure in terms of his integration.	0
"As someone else already noted, you'll have (well, we already have) nutbirds who know nothing but vote anyway. So many people vote for the ""nicest dude"" or the person with the most campaign signs and have no idea about any of this person's proposed policies or stances. Also, people who really didn't want to vote could just write ""Billy Goat"" in the write-in section, and therefore they haven't really voted... What I think we should do is severely limit campaign time and money and eliminate political parties. For example, candidates only start running a month before the election. They have a few debates and clearly outline their policies and stances. There are several candidates to choose from, and hopefully people will have to do (at least a miniscule amount of) research before choosing who to vote for)."	0
I feel the same way when I stroll through Berlin and I feel like I'm walking, there's a reason there are neighborhoods called Little Istanbul. I try to be tolerant. I know cities where I see more veiled women than unveiled women and I think: nope, that's not what the women's movement was for. Occasionally I can live with it well. For me it's the quantity that makes it. On the other hand, I have problems with saying that it's the Turks. I see a lot of Turks at my school who are absolutely integrated. But I can't expect them, as Muslims, to start celebrating Christmas now. Nor can I expect them to be happy about cordon bleu now. That means for me there's a limit to adaptation. And for me it's really like that, every now and then when there's a Zion festival at our school... I really feel it's an enrichment that through the cultures that come to us, I simply also get a broadening of my horizons as to what else there is in the world. And that is also fun for me.	1
Here's what the federal government laws should mandate how the collection companies and CRAs should investigate disputes All collection actions and reporting actions should stop immediately. The time line should be equal on the consumer,collection company,CRAs reporting period. The original debt owner or collection company that purchase the account, should produce the original copy of the signed contract, court documents, and any verifiable records relating to the dispute. Forward those documents to the disputing party within the set aside timeline. Any and all verification letters would have to state and indicate such findings. Once the dispute could not be verified by,name,social,signed document copy of original agreement, it should be immediately deleted. The collections companies and original debt owners are responsible for the validity of information they get,buy,receive,send or share. So, if they buy good or bad debt they should be held responsible. The number,types,unclear,clear,collections disputes should all be investigated the same  	0
As far as the definition of legal and illegal immigration is concerned, legal immigration is very well defined: these are people who, before their immigration, have already had an authorization to enter; students, scientists, family reunions when a member of the family already lives in the country. These are the three main groups of legal immigrants or green cards, etc. People who already have a job, a university degree, a monthly salary, etc. These are the legal ones. Illegals, illegals, are all those who do not belong to these groups, so people who entered the country, for example by a tourist visa in a completely legal way but who did not leave the country after the expiration of their visa. So these are people who are staying in the country illegally. This is a definition that has been proposed by the European Union and has been adopted by most countries. Just to explain what it is.	0
... we didn't look at a country in the heart of Europe and thought about how they solve their problems. Namely Switzerland. Yes, Switzerland sits in the middle of Europe, does not belong to it, yes? But as far as I know, it keeps its borders very tight. Does it succeed there, and not with us? If we agree that we want to stop the illegal, again, the illegal immigration.	1
I think that we should focus not on closing the borders against illegal immigrants who come to the community, but on restraining its negative factors they bring or could bring to this community in the future. Cigarettes and alcohol are often smuggled in at the Polish eastern border. The excise duty in the Eastern countries is significantly lower than the one in the EU, bringing loss to the Union as the smugglers sell the cheaper goods here. And what is more, we do not buy our own products. All in all, I think we should focus on this rather than on people who want to live a decent life in the EU countries. Thank you.  	1
I do not have any debt. I was given a telephone number by Verizon that was previously owned by a person who had not paid her bills. Debt collectors have been calling me for 10 years now and many have been threatening and intimidating. One collector told me he had all my personal information and was going to ruin my life!!!  	1
FDCPA should define what constitutes reasonable period of time. In my experience most attorneys who represent a debtor do not return communication inquiries about representation. In most cases the delay in response may be caused by the debtor paying installment payments to the attorney to file a bankruptcy proceeding. When the debtor does not keep the repayment terms a creditor is presently not notified that the representation has terminated and there is no attorney representation.  	1
I agree with the previous speaker in the field that integration is a chance to learn about different cultures, no matter whether it is legal or illegal immigration. Thank you. 	0
The Michigan program for handling NSF checks is outlined in Michigan statute (MCL 600.2952). The statute provides the exact language to be used in the demand notice to the debtor but does not include the FDCPA Miranda language- which we add to the notice. We also send a copy of the dishonored check with the notice. The statute allows the debtor to pay the value of the check plus $25 is paid within 30 days of the notice, or $35 if paid thereafter. IF the creditor brings suit (after the first 30 days) they can sue for the value of the check, PLUS damages of 2 times the amount of the dishonored check PLUS $250 in costs. This may even be used in small claims court. It seems that the idea is to penalize those who pass bad checks such that merchants will be willing to accept checks from customers.  	0

I believe all mentally disabled people should be sterilized. CMV I don't think people with a mental retardation understand enough about sex to be able to reproduce. Not only that, but by sterilizing we are actually reducing the risk of mental disability in children. All people deserve to be happy and have a family, sure, but someone with the mental skill cap of a 4th grader, for example, is not fit to take care of a child.	0
...intervene, Madam was right, each state has a certain category of immigration. In Romania for example, Georgians or ex-USSR could come on the Ukrainian route, depending on the state to another. In Portugal for example you could have Africans. But in Romania we are more vulnerable on the eastern border, we are confronted with an important danger from the ex-USSR countries that are not yet part of the European Union, such as Croatia or Ukraine, which, like all the states of the former Soviet empire, have remained a little behind the other European countries. And what Paulo said seems to me a logical question, it would be necessary that each of the states keeps a certain autonomy. So the possibility of being able to regulate this immigration according to its own criteria. [1 :	1
I used to work at an aquatic center that had women's only hours once a week during which only female lifeguards would cover the pool. As it was explained to me, the primary purpose of these hours was to give Muslim and Orthodox women a place to swim without violating their religion. It was common for non-religious women to swim during these times because they felt more comfortable not having to swim in front of men. I don't know what the rationale is at your gym. I would argue that yes, the women's only hours there may be sexist, but they also allow women to partake in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited to them during normal hours.	1

"I find it a bit distasteful myself, but I somewhat take issue with: ""It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion."" First, I think news organizations are reporting this situation obsessively for probably two reasons. One is that they are a business, they need to pursue stories that will have a large readership. The news wasn't always conducted in this manner, but today that's what we have to deal with. Two is that people have an abiding love for Mandela. Doubtless some news editors knew him, some reporters were inspired by him, and they know their readers adore him so they feel it is their duty to keep everyone as informed as possible. Second, I think most people who read these stories are trying to come to grips with the fact that he will probably not make it through the day. He was a larger-than-life figure, and there will be billions of people mourning his passing. I've heard him described as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln combined to the South African people, and the national father. If your actual father were dying, you would certainly want to hear up-to-the-minute news on his condition. I think it is somewhat similar. Tl;dr: The news organizations know that their stories will be read, and people love Mandela."	1

This particular bill collector has in the past said that I owe $20.00 more as I had a non sufficient funds. [which I would not do]. I disputed it with my bank statements and still they insisted that I have. I refused to pay that.  	1
The reason they can sell it for a fraction of what is owed is because the debt buyer is purchasing entire portfolios of bad debt. It spreads out the risk. If you can get a million other delinquent consumers to go in with you on a 10% offer, you could probably get them to take it. But it doesn't make financial sense for them to offer the same transaction to you as the debt buyer.  	0
"I would like to see a rule prohibiting debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates from being able to pull a debtor""s credit report once the debt is officially time-barred and out of SOL. I would also like there to be a rule that specifically distinguishes between a ""hard pull"" and a ""soft pull"" credit inquiry. I have been opted out of promotional marketing via the www.optoutprescreen.com website for years. I do not have debt and have never had debt. What I do have is a common name, and so from time to time I will have various debt collectors and debt buyers ""soft pulling"" my credit reports while they are trying to locate whomever they are trying to locate. This should not be allowed even if the debt is still collectable and within the SOL. No debt collector has a ""permissible purpose"" to just randomly ""soft pull"" my credit reports just because I have a common name. As far as being outside the SOL and time-barred debts: no debt collector and debt owners/debt buyers should be allowed to pull someone""s credit report since they can't legally sue the debtor outside of the SOL. So there is no need to continue pulling someone""s credit report. As far as the ""hard pull"" ""soft pull"" is concerned: There needs to be specific language that prohibits any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates from performing ""hard pull"" credit report inquiries. The FCRA makes it clear what ""permissible purposes"" are but it does not specifically state or distinguish between a ""hard pull"" and a ""soft pull"" credit inquiry. A ""hard pull"" is a consumer-initiated request for an extension of credit. Anything other than a consumer-initiated request is a ""soft pull."" But time and time again, I have friends, family members, and online forum members, tell me and show me that a debt collector or a debt owner/debt buyer has ""hard pulled"" their credit report. And some of these times are when the debt is time-barred from being outside the SOL and also from the Credit Reporting Time Period. This is unacceptable. A ""hard pull"" will decrease a consumers credit score and will be visible for up to 25 months to anyone who does have a legitimate permissible purpose to view that consumer""s credit report Making a ""hard pull"" on a debtor""s credit report could be a violation of the FDCPA in the privacy of the debtor. Any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates should be prohibited from doing ""hard pulls"" and the CFPB should make it absolutely clear. <a target=""_blank"" href="""">www.optoutprescreen.com</a>  "	1
I have a common last name, and for about three years I was bombarded with collection calls for other individuals with my last name and first initial. I finally changed my phone listing from my initials to my nickname and have had only collection call since. I am an elderly retiree. I have no car loan or mortgage. I pay all my bills on time, and I don't carry balances on my credit cards. No debt collector has ever admitted to me that they got my number out of the phone but, but that's what they're doing. I would like to see every debt collector tell the individual they are calling the source of their information. I now have a long list of people with debts in collection. Since I'm not a debt collector, I don't believe that I have a legal obligation not to reveal their names. I do, however, believe that I have a moral obligation not to do so. Please find a way to keep debt collectors from harassing innocent people.  	1
"From 1999 - 2004 I worked on a number of online identity authentication initiatives. At that time the only available solution was to ask ""out of wallet"" questions based on the consumer's credit file. For example, the credit report might show that the consumer lived on Elm Street 20 years ago. Since an old address would not be easy to find (e.g. in a lost wallet) the idea is that if the consumer knows that they lived on Elm Street 20 years ago, there is greater confidence that this is indeed the person that they claim to be. The problem with this approach is that the information in credit reports has a reliability problem. Reports indicating low error rates are misleading: they only look to ""material errors"" and they are often funded by credit industry groups. If it is commonly accepted that credit reports are filled with errors - then it is incumbent upon collectors to validate and verify the debt prior to pulling a credit report or contacting the consumer.  "	1
Yes, I am also concerned with whether or not collectors should identify themselves in a message, or if they should be more general in identifying who they are in a voice message as to not invade the privacy of the debtor for whomever else may share the same answering machine or otherwise may over hear the message. So far, I have purposely remained neutral on this matter because I have yet to form an opinion. I can see both sides of the arguments. I think I lean more to wanting the collectors to be more discrete and general about who is calling, but I still am not sure. The big concern that is more concrete is definitely the phone number caller id, in that it should be the true number of the business and (if a message is left) should also be the call back number.  	0
What I had in mind when I made this comment was that some debtors are in debt because of a medical condition that has negatively impacted their ability to work. They may be on Social Security disability for this reason. Sometimes, that medical condition is scientifically known to be aggravated by stress, such as any heart condition, or an anxiety disorder. Currently, Section 806 of the FDCPA makes abuse or harassment of debtors illegal. However, what qualifies as abuse might be different for a debtor with a disabling medical condition that is sensitive to stress. My hope, and my suggestion, is that there could be some way for debtors to make collection agencies aware of the fact that the debtor has a documented medical disability, and that abusive or harassing phone calls have additional health consequences for the debtor.  	0
After having a perfect payment history for 15 years, I had to across the board default on six accounts because I became an unpaid caregiver for my parents. However, before I ever defaulted, I contacted each account and explained what was going on. I would also like to note that five of the six accounts were still being paid down until I ran out of savings. I discovered the credit card companies HAVE NO INTAKE for potential defaulters. I consider a potential default division a cost of doing business that credit card companies have eschewed because they have co-opted the courts to do all the work for them for a very nominal fee. My goal was simple, keep making monthly miniscule autopay payments on all six accounts in exchange for no harrassing phone calls so that I could concentrate on CareGiving AND modifying my self employment so that I could make something every month. Everyone refused, and the harrassing and MORE IMPORTANTLY REPETITIVE phone calls started. I ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones, and then I rarely used them because I could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost. In essence the credit card companies and debt collectors destroyed the best way I had to regenerate earnings while still being an unpaid CareGiver. And as Marlene so eloquently pointed out, an additional roadblock is the debt collectors ABSOLUTE REFUSAL to put any verbal agreement reached in writing!  	1
Only one out of my numerous collectors for my kids took me off their lists after I told them my son hasn't lived with me for over 20 years. I also stated he owes me money also. My other 10 collectors keep calling but I quit answering because I recognize their phone numbers.  	1
"A central system has privacy concerns and it would be useful only if it included verification of who picked up the document and when. Instead creditors and debt buyers should be mandated to allow secure document uploading to their own website with official notification that the document has been reviewed. I have a pending case of a company misapplying my payments, I had to send many registered letters and faxes with proof of payment which cost some money and time. With this company anything you send them ""doesn't exist"" unless you have verifiable proof they have been forced to accept it. It would be a lot easier for the consumers to just upload the documentation and get verification the company reviewed it which can be used for a complaint. There should be penalties of fines for not marking an uploaded document as ""reviewed"" after a period of time.  "	1
I would like to add something that I think is very important: It's good that the immigration of the 20th and 21st century is the immigration of people from cultures completely opposite to ours. And this is the problem. These people don't care about our culture at all. And that's the problem that we try never to develop, never to raise them, we try to say what Madame raised earlier. We had problems, these people are different.	0
"I do NOT answer any calls that have ""unknown caller"" or ""unknown"" in the ID. If you can't show your name in the ID line, then something is not right with your company, or you have something to hide. Remember, YOU are calling ME, so in that sense, phone calls are an invasion of my privacy. I don't have any obligation to answer any calls that I don't want to. There should be a regulation that requires debt collection agencies to identify themselves when making phone calls.  "	1
I was a reference for an ex-boyfriend on a student loan application. One of the FDCPA rules is that the reference can only be contacted once by a creditor. Well, each time the account is sold to a new collection agency, they call me again, even though I tell them I have no idea where he is. I think creditors skirt the FDCPA regulations in a manner that harasses consumers. For any given account, the reference should only be able to be called a set amount of times--such as the first three collection agencies to purchase the debt from the original creditor. Here it is, almost 9 years later, and I am still getting calls for a person who is now a stranger to me. Since it is a student loan, it could go on forever. There is no statute of limitations for government guraranteed debt that I am aware of...  	1
"Marian makes an excellent point about how Debt Collectors are paid. They try to get as much money upfront as possible. Ironically, if they get too much money upfront, the credit card company might snatch the account back from the debt collector. If the amount is ""too low"" that the debt collector receives, they are not interested. This goes against many sales principles that it is easier to interact at a later date with a paying customer versus trying to make a big score all at once.  "	0
I know this from practice, for example, that in our circle of acquaintances, many Polish women come to us to care for the elderly, and they are always allowed to care for these sick people for three months, and after the three months they have to go back to Poland, have to apply for a new visa, and then come back to Germany after three or four months for three months. So they always have to leave again. Only in the meantime it is of course a very big problem that such an old bedridden woman or a man then simply has no care for three or four months.	1

How is it fair that you lift the seat but don't have to replace it back into the position it was in when you found it? It's not about men having to do the dirty work for women, it's about men doing their own dirty work that they created themselves. Men are not forced to stand to pee. They have the choice to sit if they don't want to lift the seat. It's one thing if you have a place that you don't share with other people, or you live in a house with all guys who don't need the seat down but once a day or so for a BM, but otherwise, you're basically asking other people to clean up after you. Clean up after yourself.	0
All creditors send out mutiple letters and make numerous phone calls to the consumer to give them a chance to pay their just incurred debt and those letters will include the warning that the account will be turned over to a collection agency - not always SOLD to a collection agency, but they hire an agency to collect the debt on their behalf. And then the collection agency sends out multiple letters and makes calls. If the consumer feels this is not enough notice I am not sure what more can be done. Consumers should talk to their creditors instead of ignoring the calls and letters and try to work out some kind of arrangement. But instead some do not want to take responisibility for their debt and try to push additional costs on the creditors because there were not enough letters sent out. It would be okay if the consumer wants more & more communications if the creditor or agency can bill the consumer for the postage. People wonder why the cost of health care and merchandise goes up it is because consumers that do not pay their debts and requests laws that require the creditor to spend more and more time and money to try to collect  	0

I do not know how the criminality situation looks like in Poland, so I am not commenting on that. However, I know that in Slovenia we also have low criminality. It is probably like in other countries, when there is a criminality problem, the person speaks in other language we have the impression that this person did it. Usually, the same persons are perpetrators of such deeds. 	1
The problem is enforcement. When collectors are notified to stop calling the consumer's workplace, they refuse to obey the law that requires them to stop. Reporting violations to the regulators is futile, because nothing is ever done by way of enforcement and the collectors know this. Put teeth into enforcement.  	0
Strangely enough, I am in favor of strict border control, because illegal migration compromises the position of migrants who are already in Europe. So you have to see that this illegal migration, the reason for illegal migration, has to be eliminated. These are two reasons why people come. Because there is an opportunity for work and because there are too few people in Europe to do certain jobs. And so if you are in the EU and you want to stay there, you have to see that employers don't have that kind of need so that the market for illegal immigrants is finally dried up.	0
It's the same thing. Right? Where's the difference? I kick him out again or have him arrested or something and there I say come stay here. And that's - I can't bring that, can I? That's a double standard.	0
Keep in mind that there are businesses or entities that allow people to receive credit for things they do not have money for at the moment. The business or entity, in good faith, extends credit to the consumer with the intent to receive payment at a later date. The business or entity was provided contact information by the consumer that it will use to collect or pass along to a collection agency to use to collect. The consumer can list whatever numbers or information they want and the business or entity must consider it to be truthful. Often the only way to determine if the information is accurate is to make a phone call. I've received these calls myself. Depending on how much debt and how many business or entities have extended credit may be a factor on how often third parties are contacted. I do believe that collection agencies that violate the law are not good for anyone. However, I pay my bills and would expect that everyone should be responsible for paying their bills. Much of the discussion has nothing to do with weather the bill is owed but how the contact was made.  	1
In my opinion, we should distinguish between problems which exist now and those that should be regulated for people who are illegal immigrants. What is more, we should choose some political option. We are talking about establishing relations with the countries which are outside the EU. Moreover, we should find a solution so that those refugees or people who are here illegally would not need to leave their countries.	0
As a creditor, I can agree with this notification on medical services since most people receive bills from companies they never heard of. When it comes to auto loans, and other monthly installment loans, I am sure the consumers are aware of the debt and who it is payable to, unless sold. This could be a huge regulatory burden on creditors that don't sell loans and follow current collection laws. After all, do very many people pay monthly payment to the same people for several months and them forget they owe the debt. All laws should not apply to all creditors.  	0
I agree exactly with what JP just said, in addition to the fact that in Belgium, the Chinese are settling more and more, in catering, in construction and always illegally, and always to be paid less - they - Yes, that the boss pays less. I agree with JP exactly.	1
Yes, I share this view of Tomasz, namely depending on the areas, immigrants are perceived differently. You can't lump it all together and judge everybody by one scheme, because there are immigrants who enter other countries to maybe escape from work or to enrich themselves unlawfully by stealing and so on; so they are parasites. But besides that, there are also immigrants who make an effort to adapt to the conditions and especially to the culture of the country.	0
Yes hello, I'm from Andalusia. I hope that everybody understands me because in Andalusia we speak a little bit different Spanish. That's why I try to speak a little bit slower. So, I would like to start with the immigration issue. I think we are not always completely honest about that. We try to discuss it, but often the issue of immigration is not really discussed through. And that's sometimes like a torpedo. For example, the immigration issue is also exploited by employers. Often immigrants are exploited by employers for moonlighting, because that is often the only way for these immigrants to earn their bread at all. I think that immigration, no matter how far the immigration goes, must be legalized in any case. All immigrants living in a country really need to get papers, they need to be dealt with honestly. If, for example, they can't get a work contract because they don't have papers, then that's just not possible, otherwise they're just exploited. And there is really no other way than being honest with them. We really have always had a lot of immigration in Europe. Immigrants were always needed to do the work because there were too few workers and I think that must always be taken into account. We have workers, we also have smart workers and that's why I think that the labor force has to be distributed very simply and correctly. I come from a region where you see a lot of immigrants coming by boat; you always see it on the news that a lot of immigrants come by boat, but a lot of them come by plane. I think that there must be united policies in the whole of Europe. What we don't want is a Europe only for profit, for profit and every time there is a problem, yes then we divide again. No, a united Europe. Immigration and the problems of immigration are a very heavy human problem and very deep problem and I think that we all have experienced waves of immigration everywhere and at some point it can also hit us and that's when it's also the case that we definitely have to show solidarity as well. Of course, this is not easy, but I think that we have to make sure that this issue is properly addressed at the level of the European Parliament, so that honesty finally comes into politics. We don't want hypocritical politicians. Not every time there are European elections that no one cares. Why is no one actually interested in the European elections? That is quite clear, we really want to make sure that the right decisions are made, because we really want to make sure that the right European parliamentarians are elected. That's why we all have to participate, these are really important issues that exist here and that's really very important, because it's probably not good that you always hear from politicians that everything that's good comes from their own country and everything that's bad is decided in Brussels. We have to assume that common policies are really made here in Brussels, and we really have to give the European Parliament the right power. Immigration policy is of course also linked to foreign policy. There is also the issue of climate change, of course, but all these issues should not divide the European countries, of course. We must not have a situation where we just say we are the best. No we have to move on, we can't just look at what's happening in America.	1
But they also can't send you a signed paper for something you agreed to online, or over the phone. So few people actually put a pen to paper these days to sign a formal written agreement. So that's an unfair requirement when it doesn't always exist.  	0
If you think, Zbyszek, that army is not necessary; unless you would not want to live in the country where no military is. It would be very dangerous. If this whole budget would be dedicated to immigrants, your country could be ruined because someone will attack you. It would be a very risky venture. Thank you.  	0
Well, in some countries, people also have the eligibility to participate in the school system, same with immigrants. And some immigrants come to Denmark to then really take advantage of this as well and get an education. I think it's very interesting to maybe speculate a little bit and ask ourselves what kind of resources we can also use there. There is a lot more funding in some countries than again in others.	0
"it still bothers me that ""financial literacy"" may be the escape clause that the CFPB uses to avoid the real issue. How about rewarding those of us who have tirelessly blogged about exposing the financial traps set up by the credit card companies, especially those of us who did it all on our own dime and time. Credit Cards are THE BIGGEST PROFIT MAKING scheme in the U.S., much bigger than the mortgage industry. And as the CFPB knows, any type of money making machine gets protected through lobbying. That is exactly why the CFPB was able to fine the credit card companies well over 1/2 billion dollars for aggressively marketing the credit-protector Insurance program. When something makes so much money so easily, people just can't help themselves to try and keep expanding the money making venture. I personally warned about the credit card credit protector programs almost FIVE YEARS BEFORE the CFPB made their over half billion in fines. <a target=""_blank"" href="""">Credit-Protector</a> I created my site on my own time and with no funding, and I think my warning almost five years before should matter. I also don't understand why someone like myself who created my warning so early on, with no funding, can't be compensated on any level simply as a way to energize future generations that if they take the time and show they care for something that matters, they may someday be publicly rewarded/acknowledged. I also created blogs about Chase Bank and their credit card shenanigans back in 2009. Once again, the class action lawyers swooped in and took 25 million dollars in legal fees. I didn't see a dime for my blogging even though my 2009 protest blogs probably helped fuel the justified anger by some consumers who then went on a mission to get a class action lawyer involved. Once again, I got nothing. If Government Consumer Organizations are not willing to acknowledge those who care and show it, the system may never truly improve. <a target=""_blank"" href="""">Daily-Protest</a> <a target=""_blank"" href="""">Bloggers Against Chase Bank</a> <a target=""_blank"" href="""">Parallel Foreclosure</a> <a target=""_blank"" href="""">Swarm The Banks</a> <a target=""_blank"" href="""">Wall Street Change</a> I have gone out of my way to offer financial literacy through the exposure of unfair credit card and banking policies for several years now.

I'm relatively against it, to the extent that France has to practice it - we're going to try to practice it, so they go back home and then they come back. I'm talking about some kind of country for example.	0
In the case of illegal immigrants we need to build conditions for legal arrival. When they will come to our country, they would have to obey the law while maintaining their identity and religion. I would like to add something. Not every illegal immigrant should stay in a certain country. Maybe we could allow him to stay and work there a few years and then help him to go back to his country. However, for sure we need to create the conditions in order to familiarize them with our culture.	0
I absolutely despise atheist organizations that attempt to remove public religious symbols. CMV For me, it's a simple cost-benefit analysis: Benefit: -Arguably upholding the constitution (letter of the law which no one really cares about, and doesn't affect any individual's rights or group's rights) Cost: -They manage to severely piss off, alienate, unify, and reinforce religious people against them -They give atheists a bad name, and come across as fundamentalists -They waste precious resources (money, time, and manpower) that could have been used for causes that actually do something for humanity This is all a matter of crocodile tears. Public religious symbols, along with God's name on currency and in the pledge of allegiance, don't do any harm to anyone. The vast majority of people are not ready to be weaned off religion yet, and forcing them off the teat in a publicly militant fashion helps no one. And if it's about indoctrination, do you seriously think that the beliefs of kids raised by atheists who are taught to question everything would actually be changed by the insertion of God into the pledge of allegiance? Please...	0
Regarding zero immigration: I would like to say that the people who come here, we need a humane treatment. So you can't say: zero immigration - go back. That's not the solution at all so it's not acceptable.	0
To start e-oscar should take internet complaints the same a shad written letters. They do not do that. They take internet disputes differently then they do hand written letter. That is in regards to disputed debts and it is important that the credit bureaus be consistent about the dispute process and the statues of limitations based on state laws. They should also have limits on how many collection agencies they sell the account of too including their shady practice of selling accounts of to collection agencies in different states. Their should be a cap on debts owed and the power that the agencies have on consumers. I think ultimatel it is about the collection agencies not abusing the consumer and helping consumers find ways to keep their accounts out default. A good start to offer consumers to get their accounts out of default would be based on charging consumers a small percentage of % coupled with a promissory note with a date to begin making payments to the debt collector. They abuse the consumers and they should stop it. Overall, the communication process between consumers and debt collectors is flawed with mis communications and a lack of options to pay back what they owe.  	0
I work in an organization for these people so as a volunteer and I have experienced that when these immigrants have found a suitable job they are more satisfied than when they have no job. And so what the European Union would like, that is to say this economic solution, is also a factor of satisfaction for these new European citizens. Thank you.	1
I believe that both parents need to consent to having a child for one to receive child support from the other - CMV My view applies to countries with freely accessible healthcare, and if pregnancy prevention methods can be used by both partners. For those who do not wish to have children, there are plenty of contraception options available for both the man and the woman. In the unlikely scenario that these methods fail to do their job and an unwanted pregnancy does occur, there is always the option for the woman to have a safe abortion. In the case that the woman or the man doesn't want to have the child, is it fair that one of them should have to bear the burden of an unwanted kid? We should not prioritise someone's personal or religious beliefs if they go against what is scientifically proven and the welfare of others. During pregnancy, only the mother has control over something that is to become the responsibility of both her and the father. Shouldn't the father have some degree of control over wether he wishes to take on that responsibility?	0
I totally agree that everyone can be welcomed in a country. However, we must provide the means to welcome people properly. And it is not through inequality that one is welcomed in a country; one must provide structure, one must provide education, one must provide health care, one must provide the means to do all that. So if for that, it's a global reflection and I think that a single country can't solve that at this time.	0
"Any collector who uses a robocall, without first having a live person call to verify that the phone number is correct, is lazy and irresponsible. Aside from being a major nuisance, robocalls to a third party are always an improper disclosure because prerecorded calls are required to include the name of the company at the start of the message (per the TCPA). I've received dozens and dozens of calls like this, and now I know which of my neighbors are alleged to owe money. I say ""alleged"", because the companies making these calls are usually the same scofflaws who have been sued repeatedly for trying to collect nonexistent debts. Outlawing robocalls, particularly robocalls to third parties, would hurt the bad actors without having much impact on legitimate collectors. I wouldn't have a problem with live callers using autodialers, except that the technology used by some collection agencies is so far behind the times. Telemarketers are able to stay within the required 3% abandonment rate, yet my experience is that the drop rate on live calls from collectors ranges from 50% to 100%. Yes, I had one company hang up immediately every single time one of their agents called me. I'm not sure how this is profitable. Extending the FTC's 3% rule to debt collection calls would address this issue.  "	1

Yes, as I said before. I have my opinion, I'm a teacher. As a teacher, of course I see the situation in the public schools. I don't know the situation in Madrid now of course, I'm more from a rural area where we don't experience the strong pressure of immigration yet. So it's not the same problem, but in the public education system, in public schools, we do have students who will also be of age in a few years and will then also go to the polls. In Cantabria, for example, there is a place where there are Muslim children in the same schools and there, in the schools, for example, we had to change the whole menu in the canteen because they don't eat pork, for example. So that means that everything has to be changed. You simply can't introduce the same system for the children. But the problem is that they have their right to their religion here and that is of course then also a problem. In Maria there is also a lot of pressure, on the other hand they also have the South Americans, there it is something completely different again, because we already speak the same language, but there too there are problems with integration, above all because, for example, the families of South American children are not as committed to education as the Spaniards. So especially in elementary school, the parents don't care so much about school. The school, the education, that is the responsibility of the teachers, not the parents. For example, where I work now, the situation is sometimes so difficult, because the parents don't really care about the children. For example, you see that the school is closed at four o'clock and at five o'clock the children are still there and the parents haven't picked them up. Of course, these are also economic problems. I actually only know of economic immigration, I don't know of any cases of political immigration now. For the economic immigrants, of course we try to give help. But I think that should be organized in a different way. I don't think that we have to build only public schools here for them, which take all immigrants. So that would be ghettos again. I am not talking about Madrid, I know that the situation in Madrid is completely different. I'm talking about public schools all over Spain, where real ghettos are being created. It's probably the same in France or in Germany, I think it's already happened there, maybe it's developed over time, but in Spain it was really a whole wave of immigrants who came very quickly and the capacities were just not there, it just couldn't be absorbed. So I think we really have to find a common arrangement there. Otherwise, immigrants go from one country to another and all of a sudden they are in Lithuania.	1
The FICO impact on sold debts appearing twice needs to be addressed with the credit reporting agencies and the companies that create credit scores. Creditors have a right to report the status of a debt, and shouldn't be precluded just because it already appears by the previous creditor. However, the double penalty against the consumer is certainly unfair. But it's not the collectors' fault. It should be addressed in enforcement of the FCRA.  	0
We are talking about the issue of immigration and the economic aspects. On the economic side, obviously, these people don't have problems. They agree easily. How much can we gain from this? That's what it comes down to. And there, obviously, it is easy to find agreements. When it comes to the economy, we organize 5, 6, 8 or 10 - so finally, in this meeting, we were all economists, if in (... ... ...) immigration how can we win with this and well I see that we have an agreement on 7 or 8 percent or for 10 or 12 percent. But there you go. We organize? some things and so things would be easier. Here we are talking about immigration and it's just the opposite. How much should we spend? And that's a concern for all countries when it comes to an expense, that you have to take out of your pocket. So here we have to try to represent something, as if we were the voice of Europe. It's a difficult subject. Again, if it was only economic, when it comes to this, each country would take time to solve the problems of immigration. If it was only that, it would be easy. But it is a very difficult subject, which does not really depend on us but on the governments in place and therefore there are no solutions. In any case it would be difficult, we would find	0
In Holland, no one is illegal until the procedure continues. As long as the procedure continues, those people are legally considered to be lawfully residents of the country’s territory. Those, living for 12 years in Holland, had lived there legally for those 12 years, so where is the problem? These people cannot do anything meanwhile. They cannot work, they have no right to own a house and very often they are practically forced to live on the street. I just wanted to add this, to specify it. 	1
So the fundamental question, I'm already of the opinion that it needs an EU-wide regulation because otherwise we are the - given the point of view that one country makes an illegal immigrant out of a legal immigrant and who would have to fear that he is then just deported, as far as it is legally possible with all the consequences; But if another country says that he cannot become an illegal immigrant for us because he has already entered the country legally, then perhaps the door would be opened in the direction that more would come who would consciously accept that their visas would expire. And then the difference would be much too big and [the disparity] in my opinion, but I don't know if you can regulate that or not.	0

"If the present mortgage repayment debacle is any indication of noticing or added noticing I think it is much simpler to notify the consumer whom to pay and list the original creditor name. Also, I think it would be a good idea for CFPB and the industry to combine this with FCRA issues. For example, if a consumer today reviews their credit reports the normal term is ""sold to another lender"" but no name. I have heard similar stories from attorneys who try to match what a consumer lists as a creditor versus what is listed in a credit report. Seems to me that everyone is trying to close the back door but leaving the front door open.  "	1
Since the UCC and to the best of my knowledge, State laws do not define reasonable period of time, this is a problem and has been a problem for most lenders and third party collectors based on me experience of over 40 years. Consumers should be able to seek assistance from an attorney and be required to provide the attorney contact information to a collector, unless the attorney has not already. The attorney should be required to notify all creditors of representation within 20 business days of the consumer's signed agreement of that representation. While most attorneys do notify lenders and/or third party agencies some do not and some do not respond to inquiries concerning representation. After the first lender/third party inquiry the attorney should be required to notify the lender and/or agency within 10 business days in writing of representation. The attorney should be required to notify a lender and/or third party within 7 business days that representation of the debtor has been terminated. It should not be a violation for a lender or third party to contact the debtor after 30 days to only determine if the debtor has continued representation of an attorney if there has been no communication provided by the attorney after 30 days of the initial notification in writing of representation. I have experienced no communication after the initial notice by the debtor and/or attorney received over 60-90 days and even six months. If non profit credit counseling agencies can send notification to lenders and third party collectors for representation of a consumer to reduce payments after an initial meeting I believe attorneys should be able to notify in the time periods specified. Setting rules of notification time frames would benefit all parties.  	1
...of whether there is a European will to address the problem. Because if a country breaks away and, I'll take an example now, Portugal decides that all illegal immigrants are no longer illegal, then they are quasi-legal, they can go everywhere because of the EU freedom of movement, and we all have the problem again. So we would then fall back into a nation-state problem, where everyone has to find his own solution. So either we all do something and agree on it, or everyone has to solve it somehow for themselves. But I think the point of the EU is that we act together on this solution and not just leave the countries that are most affected to their own problems, so to speak, for now. Of course, we Central Europeans are in the clear, because we can always say that the illegals come from the next country, so we can send them back first. It's also very popular, because there's no war or anything, but we have to be aware of how unpopular these measures are in the border countries, i.e. the border countries of the EU. And we simply have to support them. There is no way around it. And that's where we should take up Wolf's question, how we are prepared to have our politicians actually enforce these unpopular measures.	1
"Yes...the CFPB should require debt collectors/debt owners to notify consumers in writing, that a payment plan or partial plan will revive the time-barred debt. However, the debt owner or debt collection company should not be allowed to have a second chance to sue you for the old debt. This in itself would be bubble jeopardy in a criminal case of law. If anything a second seven year listing of the agreed balance you are willing to repay will be listed on ones credit bureau report would be allowed. Note: A collection company that purchased the account for pennies on the dollar,should ""ONLY"" be allowed to collect the amount of monies they purchased the account for plus any regulated reasonable fee amount. Because they were not the original lender in the first place. The original debt owners should ""ONLY"" be allowed to list the agreed pay off amount of the time-barred account,the consumer agreed to pay. Example: debt owner original time-barred account $1.000.00 dollars. Debt owner accepts $500.00 and consumer agrees to pay back. The only amount to report is the $500.00 dollars.  "	0
I agree with you that being in debt is not a crime, however, if a debtor defaults on a debt they basically have no rights if they cannot afford an attorney as one will not be provided for them by the state. Pro Se can easily become a mess as no one will actually help with the paperwork, even state funded pro se agencies are simply paid to show where to get the right papers, not to fill them out.  	0
I dont mind the calls to work. My problem is the frequency. The reality is that I owe the bill and I know it. But I dont think they should call my job unless I dont call them back. Tect me and call me first and give me a few days. Then call my job but not every day.  	1
"Enlisting the help of an attorney or other intermediary should also be considered a dispute. I had both my attorney and my financial advisor contact my lender. Emails, phone calls and letters all constitute disputes. I think somehow it should be taken into account that a consumer may not know the specific cause of the dispute but they may know that the end result is wrong. I knew I had made ""x"" number of principal payments on my loan and my lender claimed I had made ""y"" number of principal payments. I had emails and cancelled checks supporting the ""x"" number of payments and the history from my issuing bank also supported my case and dates. My lender refused to investigate, saying they had done everything just as I asked and I had instructed them to apply ""y"" number of payments to principal. They had no documentation to back up this assertion (their documentation was just a statement of how they processed my payments, not any of my direction). In order to get my situation fixed, I had to find the specific payment the lender misapplied from their own records, which were a mess due to the amount of errors they had made. This was not an easy task, as it was time consuming and the lenders records were not exactly layperson friendly reading. A couple of things... the average joe may not be able to read an institution's financial recordkeeping. In my case, my bank's history, cancelled checks and emails were all sufficient proof to my mind and the extent of consumer responsibility. At that point, the institution needed to justify their claim beyond ""we did what you told us to do"" and to provide proof of exactly that.  "	1

You criticize the US and exaggerate negatives in the US to avoid acknowledging the problems that exist in other countries including your own.

As do many countries which I'm sure you'd never criticize. Meanwhile, the US also has a history of being responsible for the defense and freedom of several countries. Saving the world from Fascism, containing Communism, providing more humanitarian aid than any other country in history, contributing more to the world in terms of science and technology than almost every other modern country combined, leading the world in every field of academia etc.. 1 The US is the most technologically advanced nation on earth: 2 The US has very high quality of life and scores 4th in the Human Development Index. This is remarkable considering our demographics We have the largest diaspora from the third world (mostly Mexico) and yet still manage to perform extremely well as a country: 3 Americans are the most generous people in the world, giving over twice as much of their income to charity as the next most generous nation. 4 Americans have the highest rate of secondary education completion out of developed countries: 5 The US has the highest education attainment out of any major industrialized nation. Americans are more likely to receive higher education than Europeans, Canadians, Australians etc... Pg 42 of this PDF: 6 The US dominates in academic performance. So not only does the US get more of its population into higher education, but the education we receive is the best in the world, and results in vastly superior academic performance in all broad subject fields when ranked among world universities. Natural Sciences and Mathematics Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences Life and Agriculture Sciences Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy Social Sciences 7 Americans are the most productive workers in the world: The US invented basically everything of importance in the last 100 years, without question. The inventors were either American or were working in the US, assisted by Americans. The airplane, the integrated circuit, the microprocessor, the personal computer, the laser beam, synthetic composites, digital music, the internet etc... We now live in the information age, which the US not only created, but still rules to this day. Basically every major IT company in the world is American. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Yahoo. Almost every major site is American. Every technology that you’re using to post on this website, which is an American website, was invented by Americans. Your computer is either a Mac or a PC, both are American-designed computer architectures. Your computer is running almost certainly either Mac OS or Windows, both American. You're using almost certainly an American browser and you're on the internet which transmits data via the TCP/IP protocol, an invention of the US military. The US sequenced the human genome. An American (Norman Borlaug) was the father of the Green Revolution, creating a wheat variety that is credited with saving a billion lives. Possibly the most important human being to ever live. The US landed a man on the moon when most countries didn't have the technology to build a vacuum cleaner. The US mapped the cosmos with the Hubble telescope and dated the universe, discovered water on the moon and Mars, surveyed the outer solar system’s planets and their moons, currently has a probe exiting our solar system, the furthest and fasted object made by humans. Currently, the US is at the forefront of every possible field. Almost every innovation of note since the end of WWII has taken place with the US at the helm. The US is an exceptional country. It's just that the current narrative about the US is singularly obsessed with tearing the US down. And the big problem is that there are people just as arrogant as Americans outside of the US who base their entire sense of pride and self-worth on comparing themselves and their country to the US. So they have a huge incentive to depict the US in the most heinously negative ways. Plus, it's just not ""cool"" to be pro-US. So even people who know the truth and are aware of how pathetic the anti-Americanism is are too afraid to speak up about it for fear of being ostracized. This results in people like you wallowing in ignorance. You're basically a brainwashed drone."	0
How do you expect to gain success without risking failure? Nobody enjoys failing. The reason people do it is either because they think the end goal is worth it or because they don't percieve themselves as failing. If we look at your examples, the practicing artist either thinks the drawing skill they gain will be worth it, or more likely they simply enjoy drawing in and of itself or think even their worse artworks are something to be proud of. Even men who are succesful with women get rejected more often than not, but they don't care because they know that if they make enough approachs they will be succesful eventually or they actually enjoy talking to women so the activity has more utility beyond sex/relationships.	0
Indoor live music gigs are far too loud, and should be quieter. CMV. Why do sound technicians ruin so many indoor gigs by turning the whole volume up (especially the bass) so loud that the entire thing becomes distorted and mushy? I love loud music as much as the next person, but the volume level of music at gigs is absurd. I saw Less Than Jake at a very small venue (with a capacity of about 500 people at most) and the sound levels were absurdly high - the whole thing became a disorienting blur of sound. Recently I brought ear plugs when I went to see The Bronx, and the experience was incredible - I could actually hear the songs in a clarity that was comfortable and enjoyable. It seems to me that seasoned gig goers and sound-techs alike simply don't mind how loud live music is because their ear-drums have been significantly dulled from years of going to loud gigs (effectively removing the need for ear plugs). For those of us with hearing mostly intact, I think gigs are absurdly loud, and sound-techs could reduce the volume by up to 50% in many cases for a much more pleasurable listening experience - still loud, but not so loud that the vocals and rhythm all fuse into what can be, effectively, white noise. In any case the bass needs to come down. When the bass is so loud that you feel your clothes rippling: something is wrong. And yes, I blame the sound-techs and not the band. Being in a band myself, I know that it's very hard to tell what you sound like from the audience when on-stage, even with monitors. So I think that gigs should be quieter. This would not only be more enjoyable, but spare many people the hearing loss later in life that live music can cause. I don't think it should be acceptable to have a gig so loud that you hear a ringing in your ears the next day. Change my view. -------------- P.S. - I go to gigs in London. Maybe this isn't such an issue elsewhere in the world. P.P.S. - As you may have noticed in the title, I'm only referring to indoor gigs. Outdoor gigs still tend to have sound issues of their own, but their volume is generally at a much more comfortable level due to the sound having room to disperse rather than bouncing off walls in an indoor environment. P.P.P.S. - I'm referring specifically to 'guitar oriented' live music. The issues in quality of sound are rarely - in my experience - present during a classical orchestra concert, or a jazz/swing band gig.	1

"I am an existential nihilist. CMV To avoid confusion I'd like to define the term existential nihilism as the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or purpose, and nothing that anybody does (or that the human race does as a whole) will matter at all in the long run. Note that, based on this definition, changing my view on only one of the two qualifiers would change my opinion on the matter, as existential nihilism requires both to be true. At the same time, though, when I say ""nothing will matter at all in the long run"" I'm not talking about the differences that humanity will cause in terms of releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or something of similar vein. I mean that humanity will never accomplish a worthwhile goal, one that will result in life having reached its predetermined objective or have truly 'succeeded' in any way. Edit: I just checked the thread after waking up, at 8:00 a.m EST, and it's jumped from 4 comments to 20. I've gotta leave for school right now, but I'll reply to the comments once I get home (around 3:30 EST)"	0
"I was receiving 4 or 5 calls a day from Midland Debt Collection daily for two weeks on my cellphone. As I'm unemployed and scraping by I was ignoring - or rather trying to ignore - the calls. They were always hang-ups. Never any message. As I live in Indiana - a ""business-oriented"" state, it seems the laws favor the debt collectors over the debtors. Limits on calls? Please, do. When I finally did have the gumption to answer when they called at 8:10am on a Sunday morning, I made a strong case about being harrassed and informed him I didn't want to be contacted on my cell phone. It's only a few days but I'll see. I still don't know if it was any legit debt that they were calling about.  "	1
I have a question concerning how much is being spent? I think that we all do not spend much; these are not some enormous amounts. What is the amount that the EU spends on immigrants? Actually, I have no idea what are the accurate numbers. However, in my opinion, they are not so big. Maybe anyone knows?	0
"I don't know who you are and what you have or haven't done in life, and therefore I cannot honestly tell you what your individual worth as a person may or may not be. I'm just some guy on the internet. But what I can tell you is this: ""Worthy"" and ""significant"" are human terms for human concepts that only exist relative to human perception. If you feel you are inherently ""not worthy"" due to the vast scale and general nature of the universe, etc., you have misunderstood the very nature of ""worthiness"". To seek confirmation of some innately human value from the universe itself is inherently irrational, and inherently bound to be fruitless. It's about as rational as asking your kitchen table or an orange to assert your worth as a person. Your kitchen table is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question, an orange is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question, and the universe is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question. It's really as simple as that. You are looking for an absolute answer to a relative question, but things don't work that way. All your ""worthiness"" as a human being will have to be determined by human beings because ""worthiness"" is something that only exists in the perception of human beings. The very concept of ""worthiness"" is only one of the many mental tools evolution has equipped us with in order to be able to function as social beings within the context of a society (the ability to do so being, of course, a prerequisite for human survival for much of our history as a species). I know it would be more convenient and more comfortable if there was some way to absolutely determine one's worth, but there isn't. You are therefore left with the task of determining - and more importantly, creating! - your own worth, which might of course be a little cumbersome, but that is simply the nature of human existence. Such is life. Keep your head up, keep a stiff upper lip and carry on, and enjoy the pleasures of life when they come to you. They generally do. Just keep the following in mind: ""Exists only relative to the perception of individual human beings"" is clearly and obviously not the same thing as ""does not exist in any way whatsoever"". And ""doesn't matter in some absolute, unmovable and universal way"" is clearly and obviously not the same thing as ""does not matter in any way at all"". Bet you can't prove me wrong on that."	0
"I think that it's not only among immigrants. That the problem is there. We have the same thing between us, at home. Among the people of the village, well, I can hardly speak of immigrants because there are not even 10 in the whole village. So the problem is almost non-existent in our village. But there is also the problem that people don't want to live together. It has nothing to do with immigration, we don't mix anymore. And I don't know, I think it's actually the same thing that happens here. People [... ...]. Everyone has their own little group, their own life. It's very difficult to start a bigger organization because everybody says: ""I have my little group and that's it"". I don't know, but I can hardly judge the situation of the immigrants because I don't know enough. But the same thing happens with us."	0
I can think of a couple of... no, it strikes me that we're actually on two different points. The one that Konstans is addressing is an intervention in the sense of, it doesn't go 80 inhabitants, 500 illegals, that's something that somehow has to happen now so that coexistence is possible. But what we are neglecting now is what Jutta has addressed. For me, the question also arises, does the Union or does the Union want to do anything to solve the problem in the long term? That we no longer have to send people back? Because experience shows that they are back and they just get back into the boat and try the whole thing again. That means we have a lot of boat traffic with a lot of deaths on the Mediterranean. I don't think that's what we want either.	0
Yes, I would then, that's exactly where I would like to start. And that's why I don't like the example with the tomatoes at all, because it's just not offsettable that we have cheap tomatoes, versus from me crime, so have to spend there. And if we're honest, people who come here and we keep, we have to treat just like the people who are born here. But a community system only works if it is somewhat homogeneous. And if it is only locally homogeneous. This is the problem of our Greek friends with their Turkish neighbors. Because a completely different culture seeps in there and it simply comes to tensions. We also had that in the past. There it was about the Protestants and the Catholics. The differences just get bigger and bigger the further away people come. And there is really no reason not to make sure that the people where they live are also made happy. So that they have no more reason to come here. That has to be possible.	0
"Well... America has been toppling governments and engaging in quasi-imperialistic wars since Japan was a baby. Other commenters have listed many good examples so I'm not going to repeat them. To make the discussion even fairer - because why limit the comparison to only one country? - the European empires were as bad and sometimes worse than Japan, for much longer. From essentially genociding all of North America to turning the entire Congo into a brutal slave labour camp to fighting a war with China just so they could get the whole country addicted to opium. When we hear about these atrocities we generally think something like ""that was terrible, but it was a long time ago, and things were different."" Or even if we don't rationalize it so; the genocide of Native American tribes and theft of their land doesn't carry the same emotional weight as Japan's invasion of China, or Operation Barbarossa. And the enslavement and brutal treatment of the Congolese by Belgium, while shocking, doesn't start discussions about whether or not America has moral high ground over Belgium. When is the last time someone got pissy at Britain on reddit for the Mau Mau uprising? We keep stirring up controversy and talking about how terrible Japan was for lots of possible reasons. Here are some guesses: 1. Their atrocities are more recent (though in the big picture, not really that much more recent at all) 2. They lost the war, while the West's atrocities were usually roaring successes 3. They aren't white, and it bugs us more when non-white people do bad things than when white people do My opinion is that Japan was, for no more than 50 years and really only like 10 of those, a bit worse than the West was on average for the previous ~300 years. And so no, America has no high ground whatsoever."	0
I believe that I am worthless. CMV. Well maybe that was a bit harsh, but I think I am insignificant. The universe is much bigger than anything a person can imagine; I don't think that anything I will ever do will matter because of this. This picture reaffirmed how I felt ( I am non-religious and I guess that might be part of why I feel this way (No personal god). One other thing to mention is my personal philosophy is close to Humanism. I have joined healthcare system and believe that helping my fellow man is as close to as being significant as I can. I still ultimately feel that nothing I will ever do will matter. So go ahead Reddit, CMV. **edit: I don't know why someone would down vote this...**	1
I understand how horrible child abuse is. There are many thing which are horrible. However, we should not permanently punish people for mistakes they made in the past. Maybe if we could sterilize them for ten years or so that I see works. Tails comes from a person who made a mistake or two and was busted, now I find it exteremly difficult to find work. I find it hard to find work at pizza hut, I just finished my chemistry degree and no one will take me do to two felonies...	1
So, that is, when it was going a little close ... people were going home. If people don't go home, if people become illegal, it's just an economic problem. Europe has to make sure that these countries also and it does not force economically, I cannot say that Europe has to go to work instead of these people but there is a big problem when I speak for example about Africa or sometimes they are even - they are forbidden to do by the way, even on the questionnaire, discussing, the right to vote for someone it is important. I'm proud to be French because I've been in France for 35 years and I've never been able to vote. I have been in France for 35 years and I have been French for five years and I have not been a man without voting and saying what I think or giving my opinion. Most of these countries, they don't have the possibility to give an opinion, and Europe, the West, makes sure that these countries stay like that. Many efforts must be made on this side, to let people work economically, the freedom to - they don't have, they know that, they know that, they know that and that is not the problem of us, of small people like us. It's the responsibility of the leaders who make these countries like that, when I think when Sarkozy goes to Africa and then shouted? like that, we saw and everybody and all the leaders said that we have to do that, close the borders, that doesn't solve the problem - they can always die but they will always come back. So, it's sure that they have to regulate - as Madame said earlier - it's the problem of people coming illegally, that's a problem however that European countries have to close at the same time, try to work or give people the possibilities, not that they give billions, all the billions stay here in Europe and then it's only numbers that go to Africa, that's important that.	1
I often have a very different thought at the moment: we do agree that living illegally in a foreign country is not pleasant either, and what I know from reports, from those who live illegally in Germany, that's not nice. These are wages of three euros, the constant fear of being caught by the police somewhere and being deported. The other problem that I know from reports is that someone is here illegally and quite subjectively determines that he actually leads a terrible life here, but is not in a position to somehow communicate this to his family in his home country, because the pressure of expectation on him is incredibly high, that he must please also present to this family, Germany is paradise. I have no idea how one could do that, but for me the starting point would be actually also once again at this point, so to speak the illusion, somewhere in the countries from which the people flee, that we are the country where milk and honey flow, which actually rather take out, because I believe - so I always come back to it, the real cause or the problems are actually to be solved where the people flee.	1
My only concern about this excellent comment is that consumers not be subjected to a flood of confusing or potentially intimidating information. The most useful information is the what, when, who, and why of the original transaction that incurred the unpaid debt. The original creditor should be identified by a name known to the consumer, e.g. DR. JOHN SMITH, RHEUMATOLOGIST not DYNAMIC HEALTHCARE OF GREATER ANYTOWN d/b/a ASSOCIATED SPECIALISTS P.C. You get the idea.  	0
What Nancy H said exemplifies the problem: no standards across the board. Best of luck to you. What happens to you in this situation depends on the collection agency, the creditor (in the first place) and where you live. Where you live should not be a factor.	0
We should find a solution in each country individually. Each country could put the necessary means to find a solution. I don't know how, but in any case, it should be solved, in my opinion, at the national level. Obviously, we don't all have the same immigration, so a country with a lot of immigration obviously thinks differently and must therefore provide a different solution.	0
The Poles, after accession, Poland of course is not a very rich country and the citizens of our country are afraid that the prices will rise and that the situation will worsen.	1
Yes, personally, so, I am for immigration. Immigration for all of us in Europe is very important. Immigration is important after all that we have lived in Europe and we are an aging continent too, we should not ignore it. And secondly, there are differences that we should be able to harmonize. The basis is that we should not be isolated, that we should not go it alone and that we should take advantage of all the cultures and get to know them, the other cultures of the other countries of Europe, it is very important.	0
Now I don't quite [agree] I must say. So we should explain more about African farmers who, even if we give them all the possibilities for farming, in the end they can't sell their product here. But I think that we really have to help the people there, on the spot. Karlheinz Böhm, a German, who really tried to change things, especially in Ethiopia, starting for example by digging wells, so a big problem is the provision of water and with water so we could not brig people and so on, so we must also try to support people's own initiatives. We have to show them how to do things, so we have to make sure that the money we give them is well used and only then will they stop coming. So I don't think that only Europeans have their own initiatives and are therefore called upon to export these initiatives. No, if I take the example of the farmer, if he goes to the market and he has to sell his vegetables and fruits at a higher price to earn money and finally nobody buys it then he will not be able to live on the money either.	1
What about if a person doesn't know if she's innocent or guilty? Say for example someone commits homicide but doesn't know if her particular homicide is considered a crime in her jurisdiction. She needs an attorney that will not disclose so she can learn whether she committed a crime in the first place. This is separate from the prosecutor's claim of criminal activity. And the other issue is that when it comes to courts, people typically only want to reveal the personal/private information that is absolutely necessary for defense. Say for example the circumstances of the homicide involve a trade secret that, if made public, will financially ruin the defendant (even if the defendant is eventually found not guilty). If you made it so that the attorney must reveal what happened, then why would any client risk their financial/personal/social status? Also, the other issue is that it is NOT the attorney's job to determine whether someone is guilty. That is the judge's and/or jury's job. What you're asking is that attorney's decide whether or not someone is guilty of a crime... if so then why even have judges and/or juries in the first place? Another issue is that when you give people a chance to reach an attorney, that makes them more likely to stay within the system of government. If criminals feel that they have a chance of getting away free, they're more likely to turn themselves in than to hide out or continue to commit more crimes.	0
Excuse me, I'm not really someone who participates up front but I have a problem with terminology, which also means, well also affects the content: who is an immigrant? Could you give me a clear definition, because, for example, if someone comes from outside, he is an immigrant, but if someone comes from another country of the European Union - so he is an immigrant, but if someone comes from the European Union he is not an immigrant. But for Hungary, some populations can be immigrants, so, could you give me the notion, the definition of an immigrant?	0
A certified letter plus a regular letter should be sent. It proves that a consumer is at least aware of the debt and has X time to respond. Should cost any more then the postage of the regular letter.  	0
"I think a key to your argument is that human-promoted natural breeding is the same as genetic engineering by unnatural methods like physically inserting a foreign gene in a way that would never happen by accident. I don't think they're that comparable: 1. **GMO makes more changes happen faster.** This is why it's valuable. Some changes, like [glowing pigs]( may be pretty much impossible to selectively breed for because nothing like it exists already, but can be done by injecting genes in a way that would never happen naturally. Great for getting good things to happen faster, but it can also make bad things happen faster too. 2. **Faster, more drastic change is more dangerous.** This is simply common sense. Would you rather eat the slightly redder tomato that has existed and been eaten in small numbers for centuries, but has been selectively bred to be more common; or the cool glowing tomato that was created in a lab last month and has never been tried by anyone? Basically, the ""guinea pig"" factor is much higher with GMO foods."	0
I believe that this practice in already in place in three major ways. The creditor usually already requires all of their customers to provided updated contact information, Once a consumer moves the address change and other contact information changes are updated on the consumers credit report, and finally, The USPS has records of mail forwarding procedures once a consumer moves.  	0
"To start with, a disclaimer. I consider myself agendered and don't identify as a gender one way or the other. For the longest time I ""identified"" as male simply because that was what my body was. I was always confused as to why some people felt so strongly about their gender, or why people would want to identify as something else (outside of changing the physical appearance more towards the general appearance of the opposite sex which I always assumed was for cosmetic purposes and I embraced). It wasn't until I got involved in the lgbt community due to my sexual preferences and got close to several transgendered individuals that I realized what I was missing. Everyone has this core identity, this idea of who they are. This doesn't mean that they view certain things as ""manly"" or not, it's just that they view themselves at their core as a man or a woman. It's like saying I'm white, or that I'm a geek, or that I like tacos. It's just a thing that is an integral part of them. Things became ""manly"" because people who identified strongly as a male would stereotypically follow that pattern (sidenote: stereotypes are based off of perceived averages and oftentimes are mostly useful for marketing purposes. I recognize that individuals fall along WAY more boundaries) and vice versa. Once I realized how people felt I tried to explore within myself to see where I fell and what I identified as. I realized after a long time of soul searching that I didn't. I just didn't. Sometimes I feel like a man, sometimes I feel like a woman, most of the time I feel in between...and that's what caused me to not understand the issue. I'm not saying that this is the same for you by any means, but maybe it's worth doing some soul searching about?"	1
The question is, what are we going to do in the future. There are also people who have many years of experience within the EU and the Commission. I hope that it will be possible for the EU to already adopt rules or regulations with regard to immigration also with regard to the things that are concrete requirements there. What is legal and what is illegal immigration. What I mean by that is that this is something that the nation states have to ratify at the EU level, and we need more detailed rules on these immigrations. If it's illegal, that will be easier to do. But it will be more difficult if they are actually legal immigrants, and if [the EU] succeeds in ratifying them, there are already general rules that apply equally. Of course, these must then also be observed and checked. Also in the individual states again and that has to be done in a correct way.	0
I am concerned that there is some type of rewards system in place that somehow monetizes those who report when a consumer has a potential bad credit scenario. As a conspiracy theory it makes sense since it drives up the cost of a loan.  	0
"Never say never. 15 or 20 years from now there could be a whole new crew in charge of the party that takes the party in a much more favorable direction. They will never try to turn their act around if they will never get your vote (or the vote of others who think like you). But if you say ""I don't like what you guys have been doing lately, but if you change your ways by doing X, Y, and Z then maybe I will vote for you in the future."" then they have a motivation to take those action to try and secure your vote for the future. Don't polarize politics more than you have to, make the parties compete with each other for your vote."	0
I think that this quotas system should exist especially in the case of salaries. In the case of immigrant’s persecution, there should be other laws and not only on the National level but also at the higher level. We can see how it is in France with immigrants.	0
I would say that there should be legalization in several stages, that is to say that women for example who have the risk of being abused, children and who do not know how to live in this context when the whole family is illegal. So we need counting bodies that are on the spot, that are in the cities for example and that can help together with the institutions, with the churches and with other organizations.	0
Now I think, that the person who sits in front of me is absolutely right in what he said. This is how our view on this matter is, or should be, and others have said this before. Legals or illegals come here to Europe. The most important is to provide everyone with basic needs like food, accommodation etc. If we can provide everyone with this, I don’t see any problems in the future.  	0
"I have a lot of concerns with emails. Email clients have privacy/security settings that do not allow the sender to know if/when an email has been or was received. The problem is that even with these privacy/security settings, senders are able to get around these settings. This is widely used by spammers and hackers. All of the spam experts all say not to open emails that are spam or potential spam, because the spammers are so good at manipulating and getting around the privacy/security settings and force the recipients email client to inform the sender of when/if an email was opened. Also, I do not like the idea that collectors can insert links in emails. The more unscrupulous collectors and unscrupulous employees can insert links that are harmful to the security of the user""s computers and offensive to the recipients (like pornographic material). Just think about how many collectors still (even after all of the lawsuits) use offensive and abusive language over the telephone, just think about what kind of harm these bad apples would be able to do with emails. I also I do not like the emails because of the ease with which collection companies can sell the email lists to marketers. Many decades ago, one of my neighbors was a debt collector. She would tell me that if they couldn't get money out of the debtors then we make money off of them by selling your address and personal information to marketing companies. I have huge concerns for allowing collectors from using emails. Any rules that allow collectors to use email should come with deliberate care and attention to the privacy/security, materials and content, and the restriction of selling email lists. I also worry about true and accurate identification of emails. Spammers/hackers are able to manipulate how emails are presented and the name of the email address that they send with. there should also be rules restricting collectors are manipulating and spoofing their email addresses.

"Homophobes deserve the same respect as anyone else CMV To start off with, I support gay people as well as gay marriage. I really don't see the appeal of hooking up with the same sex, but I don't see why I should get in the way of those who do. Gay people are still people, and to treat someone like crap just because they aren't like you is just a down-right dirty thing to do. Homophobes are people too. I don't agree with what they do or what they believe in, but how does treating them like crap make me any better? I think homophobes are flawed, no doubt, but I think it best to look past a persons flaws and accept the good in them. I really don't understand this witch hunt people have going on. If you respond to a difference in opinion with a backlash of hate and rage, what benefit does that have? Why would a person want to listen to somebody who treats them badly? Whenever somebody lashes out at me, I feel no need to listen to what they have to say. On the other hand, if you prove yourself to be a good friend, they just must be willing to hear what you have to say. It's almost like leading by example. I mean, they might think ""Wow, even though this guy didn't agree with me, he still treated me nice and was a good friend. Maybe just because I don't like the idea of being gay, doesn't mean gay people are bad"". And maybe they don't come around. You can still have a friend with which you can agree to disagree. That's still better than making enemies."	0
"&gt; Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? I sound like one of those legitimate rape Republicans here, but if a man is being raped by a woman, why can't he just... enjoy it? I hate to sound like a jerk but um...do you actually know what rape is? Rape is any time that one person, through force or coercion, engages in sexual activity with someone that did not specifically of their own free will and of sound mind consent. Pain has nothing to do with it. Pleasure has nothing to do with it. It's not unheard of for women to experience pleasure or even orgasm from rape; why would it be any different for men? Bear in mind regardless of your mental state, sex is going to agitate certain nerves and cause certain physical reactions. Your personal feelings can affect these by causing the production of countering hormones (or prevent the production of helpful ones), but not stop those sensations entirely. &gt; I know it's a terrible view and again I want to apologise, but does it physically hurt men to be raped by women (as in PIV sex)? Again, rape has little or nothing to do with physical damage. Also, keep in mind not all rape of men by women would have to be vaginal sex. Oral (either giving or receiving) or anal rape (pegging) are also possible. so there is potential for physical damage even if that mattered. &gt; I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc. I mean I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too (they deemed it ""ridiculous""). Welcome to the segment I like to call: Our Society is a Bunch of Fucktards. First off, not all guys are always obsessed with sex. Do we enjoy it? Of course. Do we want more? Who doesn't want more of an enjoyable thing? That's human nature! Women are that way too, but thanks to what I'm about to discuss they are more circumspect about it. So, on to why society sucks: Men are told to be a man, they have to be virile. And that means having as much sex as you can. on the other side, women are told they have to be demure, and ladylike, and not sleep with as many people as possible. Thanks to those two stereotypes, men feel like they *have* to think about sex constantly, and women act like they aren't allowed to think about it! Thankfully those stereotypes are fading, but it will take time before they are gone for good. &gt; So I guess this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped. I have a huge appetite for food. I can pretty much always eat. That doesn't mean i want you randomly cramming my face full of a sandwich I don't like and didn't ask for, does it? Even assuming the whole ""All men always want sex all the time (horribly untrue), it doesn't mean I want sex with that specific person. And to an extent yes, people that share your views ARE a part of the problem. Thanks to views like that (no offense), men who are raped are far less likely than a woman to report it (and let me assure you the vast majority of female rapes go unreported, so that says something)."	1
Consumers should be made aware of sale or transfer of their debts. From whom to whom along with effective dates and contact info for the creditor and the new owner of the debt.  	0
Yeah okay, no, I'm also a Christian and I wouldn't want to just send people back to a place where they would be tortured, no, I don't want that either. But you have to give them tools too. It's hard to say, well, do this, do that, but what do you do? And so the subject is obviously very difficult, otherwise politics would certainly have found a solution a long time ago, but they are also confronted with great problems and they are not able to solve these problems. So maybe when we can agree to move forward a little bit and Björn had [presented] all the facets or the aspect of the church et cetera, I also do this type of work but so finally we have to move forward and so as I was telling you we need one solution for [each] country or - who knows - one day more countries and in any case we need one law, one rule for all these countries, so for all.	1
If we now just draw these comparisons between Poland and Germany - there can discuss the youth from Poland - times a special question, because ehm - I have to catch up a bit; my brother-in-law has been working for many years in Poland as a German teacher in higher schools, among others also in Warsaw - he took part in the training and I heard a little bit what he told about your country and how the mood of departure is and what will become of Warsaw and I would really be interested now if this is still relevant for you and if you are interested to show, to enjoy professional training, for example to go to Germany - I'll just ask now - to do professional training in Germany and then to stay in Germany at all, or isn't it perhaps rather the case that when you look at the development of your country now - if my brother-in-law hasn't told me anything wrong - he says that Warsaw is a world city again, the economy is starting to develop and become more; Is that actually of more interest to young people, to help build up their own country? Aren't we talking about many things that are perhaps not being implemented in the same way in some countries within the EU? So would that be interesting for you now, for example, to go to Germany as a skilled worker? Or would it be more interesting for you to go back to your home country after completing your training, which might even take place in Germany, and continue working there?	1
Some people are concerned that collectors don't do much more than doublecheck that the amount in the validation notice is what the creditor says the consumer owes. THAT'S ALL THEY DO. They never do anything of substance to actually push back on the creditor's claims. I've had actual documentation that disputes creditor's claims, and all collectors do is rely on the information given them to by creditors. The CFPB is no better. My experience with them was much the same as dealing with a collector. The CFPB did nothing to verify or investigate the creditor's claims; they simply took the creditor's claims as outright facts despite conflicting documentation.  	1
To be fair, I never thought I wanted a diamond engagement ring. When my then-girlfriend was considered proposing, she asked me what I wanted and what I cared about. The proposal itself had been expected, but I told her at the time I didn't know what I wanted and would need some time. She hated the idea of me not having something 'concrete', so we spent some time shopping around and finally found a Swarovski ring with the features that I liked. It cost us around 150USD, and I wear it everyday. It's much brighter than the diamond jewelry that I own, which were handmedowns from my mother. The problem is, even though it's brighter, it is not intended for everyday wear the same way a traditional diamond ring is. Engagement and wedding rings, by their very nature, are crafted to be durable and beautiful at the same time. My mother's wedding set was worn every day for 35 years before she passed away, and the ring itself was never dented or dinged. My ring, in comparison, shows obvious wear: the coating has chipped on the bottom from where it scratches against various surfaces, the small jewels on the band have fallen out (they've been replaced now, thankfully), and I have to polish it more often to retain the sparkle. While the concept of a diamond ring as a necessary gift for an engagement was certainly engineered by DeBeers as a marketing campaign, there's nothing *wrong* with wanting a ring. For me, a diamond ring is a tasteful, tangible way to display my love for my partner (and theirs for me). While I personally wouldn't opt for a larger than life multi-carat ring, I don't think there's anything wrong with someone whose taste leads them in that direction. When I do buy a ring, I know I'll buy a diamond ring. I won't be thrilled about the cost, but I also wasn't thrilled about buying a new car, or the cost to move across the country. But I know that every day that I look at it, I'll be reminded of the love and sacrifice my SO and I shared, and I won't regret it.	1
From what I have heard, the countries should have a choice in, for example why people cannot come voluntarily to a certain country, or observe them whether they will adapt; some kind of transitional period. Shouldn’t we have some rules which could regulate immigration this way?	0
There is currently a split between the Ninth and First Circuits as to whether 1692i and other FDCPA provisions apply in garnishment proceedings. In many states, the nominal defendant is the judgment debtor's employer, but the judgment debtor is the real party in interest. To allow consumers to better assert the defenses to and exemptions from garnishment available under state law, the CFPB should issue a rule applying 1692i to garnishment proceedings.  	0
I believe most default judgments occur for one reason: the consumers know they owe the debt and see no reason to prolong the situation. Many consumers will call us and make payment arrangements after being served. We advise them they have the opportunity to be heard in court but most decline. They simply want to resolve the debt.  	1
They have two options: Either, they build a Fortress Europe, or they go into the country and help them - they have those two options. But hmm - who's going to do it?	0
I agree with Brigitte, if we talk about concepts in the European Union, there is free movement. So, necessarily, the problem of the external border of the European Union, is obviously common now the criteria of each other in terms of admission of immigrants, obviously, is a rather local issue, so a possible solution. If the possible solution is to close the borders, obviously, we have to discuss it. That is, if that is what we want. And so, decisions can be taken in a (...) unilateral way. Now, if we accept this free movement, if we accept every time, there will be an illegal immigrant, we can't obviously forbid him this movement in the European Union. So once he is inside the European Union or in one of the countries of the community, what measures can we take in this case? And if, obviously, we want to take these measures. So, let's talk about illegal immigration, and here again, obviously, I've lost my sense of direction...   There, I've found the idea about illegal immigration. If each country treats them independently, then, depending on the political party in place, the government in place, then, either we will be on the other side? of the closure, of the opening of the borders, there will never be a solution at the European level, because the European Union, obviously, since we are all part of it, it has to take measures that are the same for all. And while taking into account the particularities of each country. And so, finally, each country, [before giving ?] can be dominated by this or that party, by this or that political ideology and as it was said earlier by our colleague Jean-Paul. So, these countries, either they will want to close the border, will make it even more hermetic, while many political parties, many borders will be more open. So, the question of illegal immigration would be finally floating according to the political parties and governments. So, I think that we need a decision of the European Union and a decision that would be implemented by all member states.	0
Would it be better to leave them in the countries where they come from and support them there, in their country of origin? By different activities, which is not better. Because here they will be found in a completely different climate, with different habits. And it is still difficult to adapt for these people.	0
I don't trust insurance companies one bit and thus never plan to get insurance. CMV First off, I live in a country that has a public health system, so I am not referring to health insurance in this. I just dont see how having insurance is better then paying for something out of your own savings. I feel in the vast, vast majority of cases you would save money this way. I feel that having insurance for a very, very unlikely scenario is just the same as gambling. I also feel that insurance companies will make it as hard as possible for you to make a claim and will try and reject you as much as possible (eg: 'Act of God'). I feel that government bodies who are supposed to regulate and monitor these such things have no teeth and dont make it any better. Even if you were to try to claim insurance for something very expensive, I do not think they would pay you. I believe the amount of claims that you would make during your lifetime will never exceed even half of what you pay for insurance. Everyone tells me I should get it so obviously there is something in it. I just need to CMV!	0
There are communities who have religious opposition to vaccines have had those beliefs for hundreds of years, and the diseases have been stopped just fine without forcing them to violate their religious beliefs and violating their first amendment rights in the process. I'm with you that people with ideological opposition are idiots who shouldn't be allowed to place their children in harms way because a brother of a friend of a friend of a friend totally got the autism from a vaccine and Jenny McCarthy swears it's a conspiracy, but people with religious reasons have had them for a lot longer than the current problem, and are few enough in number that it doesn't affect herd immunity.	0

It's not that it's wrong to be introverted, it's fine. I'm an introvert. I'm good with it. That being said, life is better when you share it with others, even for an introvert. Suffering softened and success is sweeter when shared. Friends and family are important, and while it might not always be your favorite thing to do, if you care about them you'll make an effort to be a part of their lives. It will be difficult at times, but you owe it to them to be there for them and take and interest in what's going on. It's also important to develop social skills. The subtleties and nuances of human interaction are complex and many. No matter how good you think you are, you need to be getting better at it. Whatever your job, whatever your interests, you will be better at your job and your hobbies if you are better with people. How do you do this? You talk to them. I know it's not always fun and it can be exhausting, but it's important to go out and interact with people. Years of reclusiveness puts you years behind others in terms of social development. You can always learn something from other people. Not in the preachy sense, but I'll assume you're not the lone expert on your field, so I can say that you will learn better and perform better if you can communicate better. And that takes practice. Always improve yourself. Be a better man for yourself and for the people you care about, and part of being a better man is making an effort for others by being social.	1
The question, economic crisis, money against integration or for integration. The money that could or would cost integration - the reasonable - compulsory language classes - I don't know now what else would have to be done to promote integration, because that is offered, but is not perceived. On the other hand, the people who do not want to perceive anything, accept our social services in high demand. With doctors, they are first class, because this is paid for directly by the social welfare office - I don't want to stir up social envy, but that's the direction it's going in. On the other hand, when I then see that companies that go bankrupt due to stupid managerial mistakes, that have not recognized the time in which they work, with many billions and tax billions that the yes and our children and our children's children still have to pay, then the money should be put into integration, yes.	0

I do not think collectors would mind reimbursing consumers who are charged per call or per message. Add $5 for the hassle of getting the refund. Collectors should have a way to make contact with consumers who choose not to have a flat-rate telephone service. Honest, respectful and open communication by all parties is the key to giving consumers enough information to identify and understand debts and come to workable resolutions for legitimate debts. It is also the key to stopping calls to wrong numbers. Collectors who are not honest and respectful should be fined or lose their right to be licensed.  	0
And I thought it has taken place in Europe already. Are there any poor regions supported by wealthier ones? So I think that this is a situation which we have been facing already. Last week I have been in Poland, I have been there five years ago as well, and I can see that there is a lot going on, among others based on European funds, it is noticeable. I think that there are also some movements of financial resources.  	1
I think the current limits are fine. The MA rules are too restrictive and frankly could be a disservice to the consumer who wants to try to resolve the debt. I do not believe in robo calling but do believe that preview dialing on an automated dialer system should not be prohibited as the agent still has to review the information on the account and push a button to allow the dial.  	0
Sasha would you agreed to pay 10% of your earnings on investments in these countries? Think about it. Would you give 10% of your earnings for the needs of people in poorer countries? Are you ready for that?	0
... already 80% of our laws are made in Brussels. That's quite a number. But what still doesn't work out that way, and I totally agree with you on the directive, the whole immigration issues and the development aid for Africa runs completely uncoordinated. The EU has to improve that. I assume it also sees that and will do so. I don't see it as bad luck that Poland, Ireland, the Netherlands and France didn't vote for the time being. That is normal in a democracy. There are 27 EU countries, and if 3 or 4 of them don't join in the same way, there can be no lockstep. But then you also have to do some convincing. We had the problem with Poland. The Polish government, the Kashinski brothers, were so polemical. But we just let that talk and a new government came in. And we started anew and now we have a reasonable result, now people are talking reasonably with each other again. So a democracy also has to do a good job of persuasion, and so far, I think it's quite amazing, as I said before, we fought a very unfortunate war, if I may put it that way, and now, 60 years later, I know the whole war period, for me it's a miracle that Europe, 60 years later, is functioning so well. And a Frenchman, I don't know if Francois Pinoit, said in 1943 in the middle of the war, when the war is over we have to put Europe on a new footing. There must be friendship, and Schumacher did it. So we owe the French an immense debt of gratitude for having pulled it off so consistently, and then Brussels went along with it, and then Adenauer with us, for having initiated these right paths. That doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, but I think the EU is capable of learning and perhaps we only still have the problem, as I sometimes see it in Germany, that some people still talk too disparagingly about the EU. That's unfortunate and it's a shame.	0
Sure, others might have been involved. Hell, the entire PRISM system might have already been 100% in place when he came to power. There are others responsible for sure, but that is no reason to excuse Obama. The guy campaigned on privacy and civil/constitutional rights issues. He was elected in a wave of outrage against violations under Bush. Now he has the power to stop an egregious violation of said rights and is choosing to defend the violation instead. in doing so, he's a hypocrite, a liar and a traitor to democracy and American ideals.	0
I'm de facto training an Iranian at the moment, I'm training a Colombian and I'm training a Chilean. But these people also want to go back with the know how and want to do better there in their countries. But it would be a completely different matter if I were to encourage these smart people to stay in Germany. And I don't think that's a good thing. And I didn't say anything else.	1
I think that it could be successful to a certain extent, however one can often hear, that immigrants provide their services for a lower prices. So they would be a competition and would work for lower costs than a qualified Polish workforce. Thank you 	0
So, what I could understand when I worked in these two organizations, one of which was rather the reception of immigrants, the other rather in the control of immigration. What I understand is that today the states are still free to set their own rules for their own territory. These rules are more important than the rules set by the EU, which is more concerned with the movement of immigration within the borders. What I could see is that in France, for example, there was a period when people arriving in France were required to sign a contract that included learning the French language. To facilitate integration. Today we have radically changed our approach, that is to say that we ask that people who wish to immigrate to France be able to prove in their own country that they are French. So in fact there are movements of agents of the French state that are in countries that are identified as countries for seeing immigration applications and it is in these countries, when we control for example the language, so that is a first criterion but of course there is another criterion that was posed more recently by the French government which is to identify the professional skills. It's a little bit like the euro question, which effectively means choosing between [...] the immigration population, which is what we need in France today. But there is another phenomenon that is very important, which has been the subject of discussion but which at the same time is laid down as a basic principle by the Geneva Convention. It is the right to family reunification, the fact that a person who has arrived in France has the right to bring his family. So this right is laid down in the Convention on Human Rights. And this is a right that is currently unassailable and that is difficult to reconcile with migration policies in the framework that states would like to make of this migration policy. Here is the reading of what I could see and understand.	1
There is also the fundamental question of whether those who have immigrated illegally - whether we have a need, whether we don't better try to reintegrate them into their country and give them job opportunities there and outsource certain things to these countries - when I think of environmental protection and so on - in order to really give them the framework in their country, in their home country, to lead a dignified life.	0
Some years ago, a debt collector was trying to collect a debt for an emergency room visit that included foot/leg xrays. The problem was that the only time I had ever been to the hospital in question was a worker's compensation covered workplace injury and it involved only my hand (sliced open, six stitches). I had contacted the collection agency and informed them that I did not owe anything and the circumstances of the visit. Although that did not work, once I contacted all three credit bureaus with the same information, the debt collector was unable to verify the debt and they removed it from my credit report - and stopped contacting me.  	1
Yes I agree with you, I think that there is nothing wrong with doing work in a house, I do it myself. But the economic situation of different countries allows us to educate ourselves and they can't do that as citizens of poorer countries. And certainly they ask to work in our houses as well. But we must not lose sight of the fact that we also benefit from it. And sure, again, you're right when you say that they should adapt to our culture, but it's not always possible, I also wanted to say once.	0
I don't understand, Mr. Bartmann you believe creditors should just wait until consumers feel like they can afford to pay? What if that takes years? Litigation preserves the creditor's right to recover the money owed and allows it to be collected later, when the consumer is able to do so. If litigation cannot be used to enforce creditors' rights, the debt could become uncollectable in as little as three years. As noted by another commentator, this will most certainly have a negative impact on the economy and the cost of credit because it will drive up prices to cover that risk. It will also make obtaining credit next to impossible for high-risk individuals.  	0
"You seem to have a somewhat misguided view of how things are going in the US. Just because a lot of politicians and media outlets like to prop up bad press for garnering political support/ratings, doesn't mean that things are really all that bad. The US ranks highly on almost any measurable scale. Also it's good to remember that the US is providing these high quality services to 300 million + people. No other country with comparable population matches the US on any of these metrics. To help put this in context, I will compare the US to other nations and then to the European Union as a whole, as it provides a better to scale match of the US. We rank 13th in the world in education [Source]( Our score was a .978. There were 6 EU nations ahead of us. However when I tallied the 29 EU states in the top 55 on the list their average was .961, considerably lower than what the US provides to a comparably sized population. We also have six of the top ten, and thirteen of the top twenty Universities in the World [Source]( Our schools are so good that people come here from all of the world to get a chance to go to an American University, as they provide an experience matched in only a few places worldwide. This isn't an aspect of a ""second-world"" country. On to quality of life where the US again ranks 13th. There are 9 EU countries ahead of the US, and 16 behind the US (in the top 50). The US score on the QoL index is 7.615 while the 25 EU nations average a 7.27. [Source]( On an economic front its even better for the US. The US of course the largest economy in the world by almost a factor of 2. However the EU as a whole does have a larger economy. The US GDP is $15.6 trillion while the EU as a whole is $16.5 trillion [Source]( (you can also check the wiki for it but the link format won't work here). However per capita is a different story. The US per capita GDP is $49,222 while the GDP per capita in the EU is $33,101. Take into account the overall higher tax rates in the EU they also have much less disposable income than the average American. You may say, but lolitsreality per-capita GDP is scewed towards the wealthy. Us average Americans are doing much worse than they are. You are right, so lets look at the median incomes (so there is the same number of people above and below this number not a numerical average). The US is second in the world in median income with $31,111. Only beat by Luxembourg. So while the mean income is indeed higher than the median, the US fares very well in median income as well. [Source]( In conclusion things aren't that bad here, in fact this is still one of the best places if not the best place in the world to live. Are there some EU countries that measure better than the US as a whole? Sure, but there would be some states with comparable populations that scored higher than the US as a whole as well. Keeping things in perspective is key, its not just the scores, numbers, and quality of what the US provides. Its the scale, as such widespread prosperity is truly unique to us. I copied this from a previous post I made in the same type of thread, but it still applies here."	0
Indeed I agree with Corentin who said that everything had to be put back on track and new rules and new laws had to be redrafted in order to welcome and to know the name because, in order to be able to welcome them, we have to have the hospital means, the habitat, We can't put people back on the street, so that's why I think we have to do something new that mixes all these solutions and first of all, we have to help them to stay in their countries, while making sure that the money is not diverted. We must also start from a chosen immigration and include illegal immigrants. Now, political immigrants are completely complicated. That's another debate I think.	0
I would like to go back to the following issue: There are many poor countries from which refugees come from and they come, for example, to Holland. So even if they only receive a benefit, they manage to send something to the country of their origin. This way we support the development of that at least to a small extend. I do not know whether I am making myself clear, the welfare of their families, who left in the county, has increased thanks to the financial support. Even if it comes only from a benefit, we should not forget about it. If those people have then the opportunity to study, I am talking about the members of the families, and can profit from those benefit which the members of the families receive from us.     	0
New rules should allow consumers to resolve, discuss, or negotiate the matter strictly with the creditor. In other words, consumers should be told that they can refuse to speak to debt collectors about their account(s).  	0
It's not really about us telling them what to do with the money, it's about having a record of what happens with it. Because a large part of this money disappears into pockets of which the people have nothing. That can't be the case. We give something and of course we want to know what happens with it. We don't want to sponsor some potentates and so the people remain poor again and we have imported poverty again.	0
(US) I think voting should be compulsory. CMV. While I understand the irony of being forced to participate in a democratic system, I think that voting should be compulsory in the US. With a compulsory system, we could get a better idea of what EVERYONE thinks, (not just those that show up now, which are mostly ideologues on either side) and possibly get people that represent more of America, instead of polarizing politicians from the left and right. Of course, we would have to make it easier to vote in order to compensate for this policy: like moving election days to Saturdays instead of Tuesdays, or making election days national holidays, giving people pizza, whatever works. PS: I'm a total leftist, but I think we need more than left wing politicians in order for a healthy democracy to exist.	0
FDCPA 805(a)(1) is routinely violated by at least two large banks--Citicards and Wells Fargo. Both have called before 9 AM and after 8 PM. I live in the Central Time Zone and no matter where these banks are based, they ignore that and call early and late. The mailing address should take priority and it should not matter whether the collector is based in Portland, Oregon or Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, if it's 8 AM in Chicago, they should not be calling.  	1
If surviving spouses signed or agreed to a contract or extension of credit then they are obligated to repay in my opinion. Also, certain states that have community property laws may require a spouse to repay a debt even though they did not sign the contract. I believe the executor or administrator should investigate whether any debt was disputed or possibly fraud. To start they should obtain a credit report for starters regardless whether collectors disclose either way. If a collector knows a service member passed away, then the spouse, executor, administrator should not be contacted and the account closed law or no law as I have seen this type of issue arise over the years and have seen and approved accounts closed in the event a service member passed away.  	1
Yes, I agree with this, but this problem exists all the time. We should introduce regulations or some rules once more; we are talking here about Germany or Belgium. In what countries exactly do those regulations, which are the least stringent, exist? Is there any way that we could solve those problems in the future? People who move from one country to another, are those asking for asylum. But for example they cannot stay in the country because they had to go through Greece. That is why I think we ask for asylum in the country we are coming. So, those who had gone through Greece had to be sent to Greece because it was their first country of immigration, and that is why we should try to find a solution in this direction.	0
"I do not believe in the existence of a ""soul"" CMV While I think there are some arguments that make a compelling case for the possibility of God's existence I don't see the same as being true for the soul. The soul being some immortal, metaphysical, part of me that transcends death and more importantly that retains some form of identity. Once I die I don't think that there is any strong argument to claim that some aspect of me goes on living and that effects the world in any more meaningful way than the simple return of the elements of my makeup to the earth. This is my first post so if it is not quite to CMV's standards I apologize Thank you all so much for your replies, I wanted to make one clarification that what I am looking for is a strong inductive argument for a souls existence (or deductive but I don't think that's possible)."	0
I believe that mainstream contemporary art since the 1950s is juvenile and shallow; in short it is not art. CMV please I believe that art requires skill, talent, insight and hard work -- that properly executed, art touches the soul of the viewer. I've taken a few art history courses, and to my eye, western art peaked with the [Post-Impressionists]( It's been downhill since then. There is an ineffable something in the [sunflowers of Van Gogh]( or a [Cezanne]( or [Monet]( that is not there in modern and post modern art. I don't get anything from pieces like [this Jackson Pollock]( or [this Rothko]( for example. They neither excite nor inspire me, and definitely do not touch my soul. Reading about these artists, it appears that they, at one time, did something innovative that caught the eye of the art world. Instead of becoming fleetingly notorious, they became famous, and this fame fed on itself, making them 'masters' in the eyes of the art world. Articles like [this one]( where a forger created dozens of works supposedly by various modern artists, and managed to fool critics, art historians and collectors, just reinforces my view. Not all art since 1950 is bad of course, I felt an instant connection the first time I saw the work of [Kieron Williamson]( (for instance, [this landscape]( but most contemporary work seems to me dull and insipid. I'll be happy if anyone can change my view. N.B. By art I mean paintings, sculptures and installations. Other forms of art, writing, drama and music especially, are still interesting and healthy. Edit: added links to examples.	1
That's a good question. Well, I can only say generalities: Hungary, because of its geographical position, is a crossroads of cultures, so we have always had [...], people, well I could quote history here but well, in fact, we have to accept that people arrive, a lot of Chinese, a lot of blacks, so - here we don't know how to do anything with our populations in the simple and everyday, because if they live and work, it's not a problem.	1
If we legalize the work of an immigrant, he would be treated equally as an employee of a certain country. This would cause fair and equal competition. If he was a bad employee, he would get fired. It seems to me that here, it is only a question of whether it is legalized by the end of his life if he is in our country, works or is it just the legalization of labour for a given period and let them migrate elsewhere. I really do not know but I think that here this system should base on the equal employee competition. Then it would work really well.	0
All? It's just not so. Maybe retailers do; I have no experience with them. But medical billers are consistently mistaken, careless, and just plain wrong. One medical facility called my daughter-in-law's cell phone about a bill for my mother! They had her number as, I think, the fourth emergency number. And this was a GOOD place, that actually tried and finally managed to get in touch with me. I was very pleased with their billing department, compared to others we had dealt with.  	1
I'm not sure what type of insurance you're specifically referring to. But insurance in general is used to cover losses - especially on things you cannot afford. I agree with you, that you would not insure something that is worth very little. However, something like auto insurance could lead to protecting you from claims that would otherwise bankrupt you. You're measuring a cost benefit analysis. Odds of using vs benefit from using. However, that is not the way it needs to be looked at. Let me demonstrate with a numerical example: Assume: your net worth is $100000 if you get into a car accident, the damages will be over $100000 the probability of you getting into a car accident is .1% A car insurance company would charge you more than .1% * 100000 = $100 to insure you. Your implication (which I agree with) is that the more than $100 (let's assume $200 for the rest of my post) they will charge for insurance is higher than fair. Here is why I don't agree with you: With Insurance: Net worth = $100000 - $200 = $99800 No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $99800 Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $99800 Without Insurance: Net worth = $100000 No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $100000 Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $0 Would you not rather have a guaranteed net worth of $99800 (instead of $100000) than risk the chance of being completely bankrupt? That all having been said, if the numbers are the same and your net worth is 100 million instead of 100000 I can see your perspective as the worst case scenario would not put a large dent in your lifestyle	0
I was not the one with debt. I was a mediator trying to help. The people with this situation sometimes ignore the first notice to them and don't ask for a validation letter. Others, I believe, do not read it carefully and see they have a small window of time to dispute the claim. I think the original notice letter to the debtor should HIGHLIGHT the part about a validation letter. I also, think the original creditor should be required to help resolve disputes instead of debtors or third parties like me only being able to talk with the collection agency. Probably 50% of the agencies I have dealt with do not follow existing regulations. Without penalties they never will. The few that are reasonable and follow the rules are a pleasure to deal with, as a third party.  	1
I'm sorry I may have caused an incident here. I don't know if I caused an incident, but anyway. So I continue with my reasoning that I started earlier. I think we all have the opportunity and freedom to improve our standard of living. In the end, we are always looking for the best standard of living. But there are limits. The limits have to be created by someone. But we also have to be a little flexible. A little flexible. And think, that everyone has opportunities. It doesn't exist, but I also don't agree that there are other people who go to other countries to do nothing. And there are some people who go to other countries to do nothing. If someone arrives in another country that is not his own and the person who arrives in another country and does not find a job or does not find anything to do, I think he should return. Well, if the person leaves his country of origin, in difficulties, he arrives in a country of destination and creates even more difficulties for himself, so it is not logical, that. So it would be good to do a control. So the person must know that goes to a destination but with a job, with a work contract, to be able to have... to seek a better standard of living. If the person knows that he cannot... that there is not 100 percent certainty of being able to work or have a work contract, well then, the person stays where he is. Because the philosophy, the idea of getting out of a country, is to go and look for something better. To look for [Find?] that you're not going to get better, you stay where you are. And often what immigrants do is to have a life that is even worse than their standard of living [in their country]. It happens. [1 :	0

I think it's really a problem of the whole EU, because the borders are open within the EU. And people are very quickly in Austria or in Germany or in France via Italy. And so it can only be solved EU-wide. And I also think that the costs for this have to be handled by the EU, because there are countries like England or Ireland that have no problem at all. And then the community as a whole has to bear it. That is, so also such countries have to contribute, financially, to solve this problem.	0
But we have to try to differentiate between illegals who are here but working, who have families, versus illegals who come and don't work, who don't do anything. That's what we need to do [...] and keep, it's a question of feeling, I have a heart for everyone, but why should we chase away illegals who are integrated, who have been working for a long time, who have a family and everything, and keep illegals who have come not to work, to get subsidies. That's all.	0
It's important to understand that a Validation Notice (sent within 5 days pursuant to 1692g) is NOT a validation of debt. It's a NOTICE of your right to validation, if you choose to invoke it. I do agree that there should be additional regulation around this issue. But part of the problem is the way the statute is written. Most collectors cite 1692g verbatim to avoid liability for misleading consumers. But it's kind of a big convoluted sentence that the average person can't understand. I'd like to see a plain language amendment to that section of the FDCPA,  	0
If this is an area that the CFPB is interested in regulating, I believe it will be necessary to initiate cooperative actions with local State judiciaries. Because the CFPB is a federal agency, it doesn't have authority to tell State governments (including the judicial branch) how to operate or how to interpret its own law. Since some states are already taking steps in this direction ( like New York), it is likely that the CFPB would find positive reception toward this effort. But trying to accomplish change through federal rulemaking is not an option in this particular area.  	0
I don't think we can blame only ourselves. Because the people who come to us also marginalize themselves a lot. And you reach out to them, so I'm very integrated in schools and so on. And we see again and again, we approach people and they withdraw. And the reason is because the women, as they [MAN  already said that, they want it more, the men forbid it. It's not only the German that excludes people, they exclude themselves. And that's a very important point that you have to sort out somehow. Because the children, they suffer from it. The children want to and the children are not allowed to. It's so bad and I don't know where to start. It's right with the language, what they said. If the children come to school and they don't know German, Spanish or Italian, they shouldn't go to school, they should go to a year of preschool until they know the language. The children are often very, very intelligent, but because of the language problem they don't really keep up in school and are pushed further and further back. And I think that's such a shame. You have to give them a start. You have to say: ok, it doesn't matter, Americans, Frenchmen or whatever come to us, they all have to be able to speak the language if they want to live in Germany and go to a German school. And if not, do a year of preschool. That's not done. That carries through to higher grades, if the language is missing.	0
I would like to remind you that I myself am a product of that time. In Germany, there was already a time when millions of non-Germans - not all of them were Germans, but they were officially Germans - were forced to leave their homeland. The community, in which I grew up, grew by 70 percent from one day to the next. With a little bit of good will, immigration today as then is possible, but you have to want it.	1
I have not heard of anyone in the US being imprisoned for their debt. I have been in the business for 20 years and rest assured, while there are 'debt buyers', the majority of agencies are contingency based collections.  	1
I wanted to talk here about an issue that is relevant especially in my country. We really have an immigration that is legal. And they work in the development of the country. But then they have descendants. They have children. And these children do not have the same capacity to respond as their own parents. The parents arrived to work and then the children really take advantage of this situation of living in this country and instead of using their capacity to improve the host country they are there to destroy this country. So that's where we have nothing to do with the problem we are dealing with here. But it is really a question that is really important in the background. These individuals are legal individuals and their parents have papers, are legal, but end up doing nothing for the country. They don't like to build, they like to destroy. I'm talking about this because regarding the Portuguese women who immigrated to the United States. There is a situation, the following. When they commit a crime, they are sent back to their country of origin. Even if they are legal in their country. Even if they are the children of immigrants who have papers and so on. They are sent back, deported from the United States. But I don't know if that's an issue that we're going to discuss in this setting.	1
"I think the requirement for a debt collector to send a validation notice 5 days after the initial contact is backwards. I believe communication between the debtor and debt collector would be improved if the debtor has the validation notice before the initial telephone contact. The debt collector should be required to mail the debtor a validation notice 5 days before any phone contact, not 5 days after. Otherwise, the debtor is speaking with an unknown caller, who has surprised them with a demand for money. The debtor has not been provided with any time to prepare their thoughts, or to formulate important questions about the alleged debt. They may be caught ""off guard"", increasing the fear and anxiety of the debtor, which would necessarily lead to impaired verbal communication. The debtor has no written factual statement to refer to during the phone call, while the debt collector has all of the factual details in from of them on their computer screen, and can cite facts and figures. This situation creates an imbalance of power not conducive to good communication. This proposal to require debt collectors to send a validation notice 5 days before the first telephone contact would impose no financial burden on the debt collector, because validation notices are already required to be sent to the debtor. It is simply a change in the timing of an already existing requirement.  "	0
I will be very brief and I will have what Pedro was saying. I have a solution. I have the solution. So, the Latins, the Portuguese, the French, the Spaniards, the Romanians, the Italians, we should have a more Muslim habit, we should have more women and we should have more children. Certainly. That's it. We finish with the jealousy, everything is solved.	0
"I think we have to stop [...] saying ""we have to give subsidies"". That's not true. It's not grants that their wrong. It's brains. You have to go and help them. When you see - we send them boxes of milk, that they don't have a bucket to heat milk ? But it's not that. They just want to be like us but in their country they follow their know-how. We don't need millions and millions."	0
I would like to come back to what Johann said, so there we can easily detect what the opinions are in Europe. We in Austria, for example, have lived through the war in the former Yugoslavia very closely, we are a neighbouring country, we have lived through the same thing with the Czech Republic and with Czechoslovakia in '68 or with Hungary in '56, so Austria has always lived very close to the border of these events, a border that fortunately no longer exists, and so Austria already at that time welcomed refugees from all these countries. And these people were really welcome, but that changed immediately, unfortunately, so when they were more or less integrated, we wanted to send them back to their countries, but of course it didn't work, and in our country there are also very, very different politicians; for example, the politicians that we have now in Austria, for example, have no longer really experienced this phenomenon of refugees from Hungary and so on in their own [lives], so they don't really understand. The new generation has not experienced these dramas anymore so they have a completely different attitude and so this problem is only an Austrian problem but it has to be multiplied by 27 because we obviously have a very very different situation in the different countries of the European Union and even within the countries the situation sometimes changes so it is really not easy to find common solutions. Thank you.	1
"So, to me, the question has not yet been answered properly, why we or why it is good for us or for another continent, if for example Africans come to Europe. That has not yet been explained here at all, why that should be good. As long as there is no bonus for Africa and no advantage for Europe, we don't need to think about the fact that there are some Africans who are perhaps desirable here, just to give you an example. And to that extent, I would say there is only one answer here, ""yes"" or ""no."" We let them in or we let them out completely, but not anything in between."	1
I think if we're in skilled wage - in skilled jobs and there's a supply there, meaning the companies need people to do the work to keep that whole operation going - I don't think migration will make people willing to work at low wages. They are well educated, they are comprehensively trained, they have comprehensive knowledge when they come here, because they come here not to live in a country or to say that people are basically better off there, so I'll go there, but they have an education, they want to do their job and want to earn money there, and I think they know very well about their market value and about their price. I think this price dumping, I have more concern in the low-wage areas where it's just about - excuse me - about masses, about the many people who are looking for work there, where then the employers have the chance to push the prices down. I think in the higher end, that's not the case.	0
I think you have to take measures as much as possible, but that's like having an alarm for example, if you have a dog or an alarm to protect you from the burglars, that can work, but that doesn't protect them 100% from the burglars. It's like with the immigrants, you have to take a lot of measures, take all measures. The repatriation and everything possible to keep this problem as minimal as possible. Thank you.	0
"Either State or Federal law should provide some penalty for passing an NSF or ""closed account"" check that includes a presumption of guilt. The check either bounced or it did not. There's not a lot of grey area here. That said, either State or Federal law should also allow the drafter of the check a ""safe harbor"" wherein they can pay the face value of the check and some nominal compensation for the hardship suffered by the recipient of that check in order to avoid this penalty. Michigan has such a procedure and it seems relatively equitable.  "	0
The example you gave us about the Muslim society: in Ljubljana we have a Muslim minority. I personally know few Muslims and I can really tell you the examples. If they will be close to other cultures they would never integrate in the society. I know some cases of people which were well integrated but still did not abandon their roots. They just could find a balance between one and another thinking. I think that integration is here the key word. How to integrate? For sure not assimilate. Integrate not assimilate; and that is the difference.	1
doktatogun made some very good points against it from a medical point of view. Considering that, you surely understand the laws. Of course you peeing in public is not gonna hurt anybody, but when everybody starts doing it, it's a different story. Great analogy here would be Egypt where it is prohibited to take sand as a souvenir. Sounds ridiculous at first but considering the masses of tourists they have it's quite understandable. However, just passing a law like that is like telling people like you (and me, I know your problems only too well) to go fuck themselves. Thus whilst passing this law is acceptable there has to be some kind of 'alternative' to be provided, I think. Take Amsterdam for example: they have public 'urine walls' with a little privacy fence of the height of your head. Great solution in my opinion (not really applicable for women, though). Call your representative and tell him about these?	0
So selective legislation, what do you understand by that? What would be your concrete proposal to find a solution regarding the principle of selective legislation, so people can come in, they get their residence permit and if it expires, it's extended and so on - so what do we need to do to not always produce a bolt-on effect, to not always go in circles?	0
I would differentiate: If he comes normally, the whole world can come for all I care - doesn't matter to me. But if he comes like this, I can clearly say, the whole world comes here, we work for you, we don't do anything else for you, we only work for them, the whole world - then the whole world can't - I don't know, I don't understand, I don't get it, for me it's a double standard - I'm sorry.	0
I totally agree with Claire [CLC]. We should try to have a regularization procedure for what concerns immigration. I'm not talking about victims of war, in countries that are affected by war, refugees, but otherwise if they all come to the European Union, let's take Germany and illegal immigration, if there was massive illegal immigration in Germany, it would no longer be bearable. So there should be a certain regulatory framework, a certain procedure. As far as crime is concerned, I would also say that it is more a question of mentality, even if we always hear in the press that there is a lot of crime in the immigrant communities, but this is mainly due to the fact that there is illegal immigration for which no good integration measures are introduced. At the time, we always said that the country was not a country of immigration and now we are really at the heart of the problem.	0
Maybe we should look at the countries from which the immigrants come from, who comes to Europe most of all and how could we help those countries. The countries where the immigrants come from. 	0
I can't comment on any of this, but it would seem appropriate for Federal law to establish a framework of requirements for states to meet. This would level the playing field for debtors and creditors in all states. and would provide an equal basis for states to proceed with adding or amending their own laws affecting debt collection lawsuits.  	0
"There is indeed immigration from concrete conflicts and this is clearly a European phenomenon, that is to say that the European Union can come back and therefore must leave its entire territory. Now, when countries that also have borders with the Mediterranean, therefore with Africa, I believe that we must certainly also and from these countries, therefore France, Spain, Italy and so on. But the countries that do not have borders with the Mediterranean cannot simply say: ""That's it, that's the problem of those countries"". It is true that some countries are really suffering because there are many people who come to them and they do not know where to put them and there are other countries that have practically no such problem. So we have to make sure that each country bears a part of this responsibility and that it is not only a few countries that have this border to Eastern Europe or to Africa for example."	0
I keep getting collection calls for some unkown person on my cell phone at least 4 times a day. I have repeatedly told them that this is not that person's number. I recently got a new number and it is so aggravating to monitor your calls because of someone else  	1
Yes so I think we are just very helpless in all these things, yes? And it has also for example now in Lithuania simply to do with the fact that there is no one there yet, because their country is simply economically and socially not interesting for immigrants. That will come, yes? At the moment when they will be better off, also economically, etc., then they will also want to come. And that's the difference, I think, that we have to keep in mind right now, between economic refugees and political refugees, those are two different pairs of shoes, yes? And the political refugees, if they are really persecuted, you have to help them, yes? Nothing can help them, human dignity dictates that. But the economic refugees, that's the big question, what do you do? And it is much better to help the people on the ground. And as long as we will not be on the same level, by default, there will always be some form of e- or immigration, yes? That's the way it is. So that's kind of quite logical. And so the program also tends not to be in the country, but rather where they come from, that you have to help there. If they are already there, they have to be helped in our country, too, right? But otherwise, I think it's more important to strengthen the economy in their home countries and to make sure that the people there are doing well. They are uprooted somewhere and certainly not happy here from many cultural backgrounds. I think the Europeans among themselves in the EU are very capable of assimilation, yes? So even a Spaniard who has lived in Germany for a long time will be able to speak German very well at some point, yes? And of course he will probably still be very close to home, but he will have integrated very well, yes? All other cultural groups, it is really difficult, for example, I have cases near Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria, just two days ago I spoke with a young mother who has a child, a 6-year-old in preschool, kindergarten, and there are now three Austrians out of 25 children, all the rest are foreigners. Yes. And there it is; there is the critical mass. This is an expression from physics, but I would also use it in this context, yes? It always depends on the quantity. Can a place still cope with that, can a region still cope with that, or will it be too much? Thank you.	1
I had a particularly lousy experience with an abusive debt collector called Miracle Financial, working on behalf of Verizon Wireless to collect a debt I wasn't aware I had incurred and didn't believe I owed. The full account -- and dozens more from people leaving comments on my blog over the years -- is available at the supplied link. I had my identity stolen and I didn't even know it. They could not produce a signed credit card receipt to compare my signature.  	1
Other users have shown how his actions are probably legal, but from a moral standpoint, why is the fact that some of them were American even relevant? Is killing an American worse than killing a foreigner? With regard to Al-Awlacki, if you are involved in a terrorist group, why should the fact that you were born in the US protect you? I understand why people have a problem with drone strikes in general, but I do not understand why the fact that one of the targets was American matters for any reasons other than legal ones.	0
The FTC got this one right. Alternative one is easy to communicate and understand. Terms like default and charge-off can be confusing and subject to interpretation.  	0
I have the direct opposite view, so let me weigh in-I feel like art didn’t get properly started until the 20th century, the stuff that came before it is interesting, but doesn’t have the same understanding of what art is, and usually doesn’t even seem to be trying to. They seem more interested with trying to directly imitate nature or convey religious ideas than explore or define art for its own sake. I’ll focus on the Mondrian painting, since I consider him to be the most important artist of the 20th century. You claim that there would be a better way for these artists to express their ideas, you also claim that they require little/no skill. If you look at Mondrian’s body of work, his ability to paint realistically is obviously great, but he wanted to explore what a painting actually *was*, and condense that to its core; to strip away everything that wasn’t *essential*. This is why he used only horizontal and vertical lines, because they implied every other possible line and shape, and the three primary colours because they implied every other colour. How else would you suggest he convey this message? His solution seems, to me, brilliant, elegant, and inevitable. Modern art is concerned with “what is art?” and the modern paintings you have shown are concerned with painting as colour on surface, which, to paraphrase Clement Greenberg, is all they are and all they should be. These concerns fly in direct opposition to your own, which, from your criticisms, seem to be primarily about producing pretty pictures.	0
I've heard multiple stories of summons being dropped off or served to the wrong individual and summons being mailed to old addresses when the new address was clearly available. I don't believe that a summons should ever be served by mail. If the debt collector wants to sue, they should be required to serve the person directly in the city and state in which they currently reside. It's an especially dirty tactic to serve someone by mail. It's unreliable and puts the debtor at a disadvantage.  	1
Explaining why the repeat phone call abuse happens does not justify it. Apparently there are autodialers that call several consumers at the same time, than hang up on all but the first consumer that answers the phone. The result is a person can get several collection calls and hang ups through out the day, that is just not right.  	0
Dear friends, nobody in the EU will determine quotas for the states and I think it is absurd to determine such quotas. Only employers knows how many employees they need, how many of them they can employ. The state as well but only in certain areas, but not the EU. The EU should not determine such quotas and the number of immigrants that a certain EU-country can accept. How can the EU know this? Seasonal workers are necessary, depending on economic developments. Now the situation is critical because we have an economic crisis so we do not need those people who came from abroad because we do not have work for our own citizens. However, if we established concrete quotas, we would establish this situation. In socialism it was similar, we had similar plans and we established absurd quotas.	0
security would be paramound. Since the weaknesses in current authentication practices financial institutions/others covered by FACTA and the FCRA are not within the scope of this legislation, it shouldn't be difficult to impose those same security standards on any centralized debt collection database.  	0
Yes, I'm from Vilnius, from the capital and what is said here that there are no immigrants in Lithuania, that's not quite true. We have immigrants too, but they are legal immigrants. I've never really been interested in it, but they do seem to be legal immigrants. But I think that the European Union would definitely have to be stricter. Because there it's like, you would definitely have to share the language as well. That is so, that are people with very different cultures. And often, of course, integration is also a very big problem. Thank you very much.	1
I had an issue where an attorney,acting on my behalf,requested verification of the loan debt and never heard back from the collector. Therefore can not move ahead with settlement until they respond.  	1
I would also like to react. In fact, in all, well in all job markets, you need people. There are people who don't want certain jobs. And migrants do a lot of these jobs. We must not be mistaken. And selective migration, a choice of people, I think it is a practice of modern slavery. In the past they were brought with a chain, now they bring them with a computer.	0
I don't think breakfast is all that important, or necessary. CMV For many years, I've regularly skipped breakfast. It's sort of an established habit by now, I picked it up in school when I would be in a rush in the mornings, and it's gradually evolved to the point where I regularly skip breakfast, often skip lunch, and just eat a slightly larger dinner, or a separate dinner and supper. During Ramadan, when people fast until sundown? I do that almost every day, with no apparent ill effects. I know this is supposed to be unhealthy, but I don't have any concrete reasons as to *why*. People label breakfast as the most important meal of the day, but I don't know why. Over time, it's become something of a hindrance to me. It's just such a hassle in the morning to try and throw together some sort of food when I'm trying to get ready for the day. For a long time, I'd simply forget to eat, I wouldn't feel hungry until later in the day. I know this is supposed to be bad for me, and I'd really appreciate it if someone could provide me with some concrete reasons as to *why,* so I can convince myself that it's important to eat normally.	1
"The letter I received just said this communication is for the purpose of collecting a debt. First, it was supposed to be a ""validation"" letter, but they don't bother to validate they jump the gun. Communication is always the best way to avoid confusion, so I don't think it would be a hardship on anyone to state clearly this is a debt collection agency/company why use euphemisms. And then to state unless such and such is paid by (whatever time frame is legal) this will be placed in collection. I believe there is some rule now to that effect, what I think the problem is, it is not handled consistently. Each of these many many debt collectors do their own thing. Some are better at communicating than others. Some deliberately do NOT communicate, for deliberate reasons. Crafting consistent rules and regulations should be the start. And then actually requiring these companies follow them. If you don't put teeth into it, none of these collection agencies will bother. There are already rules. But we are here because of lack of obeying the law, lack of ethics, lack of clarity in the law, and in my opinion, laws that are slanted against the consumer.  "	1
You're asking for something impossible. Anything that can't be observed requires faith to believe in. Since we can't yet observe the afterlife (if such a thing exists,) we can't prove or disprove it. It's also possible that we're actually in the Matrix right now; all of us. Or that none of you exist, or that I don't exist; or that I'm a banana. None of those things are useful discussions because none of it can be proven or disproven. What you have to do is decide whether you're ok with a) dying and vanishing into nothing, or b) after you die the thoughts, feelings and experiences that made you you will go on. Personally, I don't think I would live very long if I believed I'll just vanish when I die. I'm of the opinion that there is an afterlife because it's what I have to do for survival. It's a paradox that I'm fully aware of and accept. I don't know if my brutal honesty will help or hurt you in your quest for peace, but I do hope you hang in there. There's a lot of good you can do for the other bits of grey matter in this world.	0
Additionally the landlords real estate attorney also had a collections agency so he continuously flipped the landlords debts into his agency and again the landlords get to keep writing it off with each and every lawsuit, in this instance it was 8 lawsuits for the same amount.  	1
I would just like to add to that statement which is true that it is a return term. We deport them, they come back and if we don't introduce biometric identity cards or all the new things that are being proposed to us, it will indeed be a turn off that makes them come back but I repeat, I always repeat the same thing, that all this is linked to the real immigration policy. The real policy is that we apply what we do and so we don't do it, then our discussion will go in circles.	0
"I don't know your age, but there is one thing that you may not have considered: Things aren't the same as they were when you were growing up. You say that we shouldn't be babying these kids who are victims of bullying. Did you feel that way when you were being picked on? Or did you wish someone would do something to stop it? What tools did you have to respond with? What tools do you think these kids should be given so that they won't be victimized? I mean, we have laws to protect adults from harassment... Why do you feel that children deserve anything less? As far as Cyberbullying: It is easy to run away from a bully in person (which is what you say you did). It's a lot harder to get away when those bullies can track you to your home. Can harass you at an time of day or night. Can torment you from anywhere on the planet, regardless of where you are. Bullying no longer stops when you leave school or the playground. I would bet that when you were being picked on, you at least knew that when school let out and you got home, you'd be safe for a few hours. That you'd have a weekend free of having to worry about bullies. You had something to look forward to. That isn't necessarily the case anymore. Another thing is that, from what I have seen, it is rare that the cases of cyberbullying that we hear about only involved one bully. Usually, it's one or two who recruit others to join in. The feeling of anonymity that the internet provides does mean that more people will say things that they never would in public where others can see. That isn't silly. It is a proven phenomenon and there is a name for it; [the Disinhibition Effect] ( And saying that words on a screen hurt any less than words that are spoken. That they are any less real... well, that just isn't true. To conclude: Not that long ago, the internet wasn't as important as it is today. People didn't use it on a daily basis to connect with friends and family. It wasn't as important as a social tool. That isn't the case anymore. For the youth of today, the internet is just as important to their social life as having a home phone was when I was growing up (28 now). It is how we connect and stay in touch. So, while it is easy to say 'Hey, if you don't like what people are saying, don't listen. Don't log on. Don't look at those texts or IM's or Facebook Chat Messages..."", doing so would mean isolating your self from your friends and family. It would mean cutting out a large portion of your social life as well. It isn't as easy as 'just walk(ing) away' anymore."	0
"We instruct our collectors to treat EVERY dispute the same--whether received in writing or over the phone and without regard to when it was received. Therefore, I agree that debtors should provide the information referenced in FCRA. The problem with FCRA disputes is the E-Oscar system that only affords the collector a couple options like ""account information is accurate as of date reported"""" this doesn't even make sense as a response to the info provided by the debtor. If E-Oscar is going to be a valid ""dispute"" under FDCPA, that website needs some serious updating including making sure that disputes actually contain the information listed in CFR 1022.43(d) and allowing collectors to transmit the actual contract/itemized statements/etc back to the debtor.

I believe the criticism of Twilight is just thinly veiled misogynysm CMV The level of derision heaped on Twilight has little to do with the actual quality of the films or books and a lot to do with men not being able to cope with the fact that there is a successful franchise aimed at women. Worse still at young women. And don't get us started on Twilight moms. Lets slag them off in the queue for Man of Steel or Iron Man 3. Worse still is the patronising argument that Twilight is a bad influence on young women. This no doubt made by the same people who would have a spasm if you suggested that Video games have a deleterious affect on young men. Young women are quite capable of recognising the distinction between fact and fiction. I can offer no evidence as this is my opinion but what set me thinking was [this]( piece in The Guardian.

Legal immigration is always the better solution. If you bring in people who have certain job profiles that are missing in our country, who can supplement. Because that's the only way we can solve our labor shortage - when I look at the current shortage of 40,000 engineers in the Federal Republic; they won't grow back because of school problems; graduates are still being taught social sciences and not technical problems. If you do it that way - only if you do something like that with the Blue Card or the Green Card and fix it for a certain time that they are allowed to be here, then it is the wrong way. That would perhaps be a question for the experts tomorrow as to why that should be the case. So, fixing stays for a certain professional group is wrong; then they won't come, the right people, because then their families will have to stay at home and they will work off their five or however many years here, earn money and leave again. That's not a solution.	1
"I have thought **a lot** about this topic. I live in germany, so by default I have been confronted with the topic in school many times. History was my strongest class. I then studied social sciences and after graduating have been studying a lot of neuroscientific literature and studies. Humans are not brutal by nature, we are very complex beings. Our brains are incredibly adaptive to our surroundings and experiences and *most* of all to our culture. The crimes commited in the concentration camps were commited under circumstances specifally designed to make them possible. Even the genocide in ruanda (which seems a lot more ""spontaneous"" on first glance) had very complex historical backgrounds and was incited very deliberately. I would argue the contrary: Humans are benevolent and social creatures, that are very capable of violence. Think about it. You are less likely to die of violence today, than ever before, why? Because we built our societies in ways that prevent violence more and more. Are we having setbacks? Of course! Thousands of years ago, we had to use a lot more violence to survive. Hunt animals down and kill them, defend them against other humans (not brutal humans, *hungry* humans). But we always made our best efforts, to make everything safer and safer. We rebuilt and tried to make it better. And can you argue against the fact, that we have the most comfortable live (on average) today, than any generation before us? Why? Because we are brutal and uncivilzed? That does not make sense."	1
There is a difference between economic immigrants and political immigrants. Most of the political immigrants are not from the EU but from third countries and economic immigrants are mostly from the new EU countries. Where nothing is developed yet, I am of the same opinion as the Sissi, there the development must take place simply more. That in poorer countries like now also Lithuania and so an infrastructure is there, there some fast social being are created, some money is there, that there is not the work migrates into our countries purely or into other countries purely, where it is already there and is displaced elsewhere again. Otherwise there is also no construction there in other countries where already some capital is there, there is again a problem because you can not accommodate the people that there is enough work for all. This is a redistribution, which in my opinion should be regulated by the EU. And people who come from third countries, I think Spain and Italy in the south of Europe, they are a bit afraid of the North Africans; North Africans, nonsense; Africans in general, who are coming. You have to make sure that there are better conditions in Africa, then none come to Europe, it's very simple.	0
I heard somewhere - I don't remember exactly where it was - that sometimes we fill planes in these third countries with children, we send them to our countries but if these children at that time would be protected, they already have their place in our society. I'm not against children, of course, but even if they are illegal, I would like them to be able to go to school, to have the opportunity to get an education.	1
So we can't put the children aside. School is a social place. It's a place where relationships are forged, and if children are practically put aside for a year in preschool, then they're isolated again. In our country everyone is accepted, but in our constitutional state we also know: we have values that we want to transmit, that we also have to share. We must try to achieve an integration of all values. The values that we hand over and the values that we receive. We have to somehow come to shared values.	0
"(For full disclosure, I am Korean btw) I don't know if you can compare one country's crimes with another's. Each country's crimes are unique, and what each country did was unique to its time period and place. That being said, the US has quite the laundry list when it comes to invalidating the sovereignty of other nations: * Sending troops to aid the White Army during the Russian Civil War (1920's) * Toppling Iran's democratically elected government and re-instituting the Shah's power, twice * Basically controlling the politics and ruling governments/dictatorships of South America until very recently – essentially, if a government was deemed a ""threat"", no matter how good to the people they were the US stepped in and immediately toppled them * I haven't even touched the Middle East yet. Is this nowhere near what Japan did? I don't know. I really don't think you could compare the two."	0
"I'm more comfortable pirating a famous band's music than I am pirating a small-time musician's. CMV I don't always pirate music, but when I do, it's a famous band's music. I'll tell you why. I think that small-time musicians need my money more than famous musicians do. I would feel much more guilty about pirating a local band's music than I would feel pirating, say, Billy Joel's music. Billy Joel doesn't need my $1.29, whereas a local band would certainly need it in order to make a career out of music. I'll much more willingly give my $1.29 to my friend's band than to Billy Joel. TL;DR: Famous musicians don't need my money, so I pirate their music more than I pirate a local musician's music. EDIT: I'm not saying, ""Nobody should ever buy Billy Joel's music ever again,"" nor am I saying that I will never buy Billy Joel's music ever again. I'm just saying that I would rather support local musicians rather than musicians who are already successful. If I have $10, and I want my friend's album and Billy Joel's album, either of which would cost me all $10, I'm going to choose my friend over Billy Joel. EDIT 2: I realize that pirating is wrong. However, the question was not ""To Pirate or Not To Pirate?"" That question was ""Why Should I Feel Guiltier for Pirating a Big-Name's Work Over a Local Band's Work?"" In this scenario, I am already going to be pirating a song. My CMV comes in when the choice of who to pirate from comes up. EDIT 3: I feel guilt either way, but I feel much guiltier if I pirate from a local band, who depends on every sale. If I'm pirating a song, it's very likely that I wasn't going to buy it in the first place. So the artist isn't losing any money. Or, what happens if they make a music video and put it up on Youtube? If I just listen to it on Youtube, and I never buy it? Should I still feel guilty over that?"	1
Rather than propping up a corrupt and unjust system that will only get worse with time, students who scholastically deserve what they're not getting should be working to expose the cheating of those who rob them of their future. By capitulating to the broken system, they allow the entrants to universities to be diluted by cheaters who can't do the work. While the short-term gains to the student may seem justifiable, essentially, the cost is far higher... intelligent students should be able to see that.	0

The CFPB should require debt sellers to contact the debtor and inform them the debt has been sold. Additionally, ALL pertinent information must be given to the debtor to eliminate any confusion. Furthermore, the seller of the debt must be required and enforced to annotate the debtors credit report with the sale to help eliminate confusion and in a way to not increase the bad debt. Essentially, debts that are sold sometimes appear as two seperate debts on a consumers report which increases the penalty of having bad debt. A consumer should not be penalized twice for 1 debt.  	0

Well, closing the borders. I do not think that is an option. For me, there is no such option at all. I do not know either whether it would have any financial or economic influence. Most of all, I am thinking about the humanitarian issues. We live relatively comfortable here in Europe, at least in Western Europe, but somewhere else in the world, those who do not have such good conditions should have a right to use it. However, the criteria should be rigorous. Being a member of the EU, one should work it out on the EU level, because when all countries start to regulate their own laws and regulations, it would lead to a complete chaos. I believe that opening the borders fully would have negative consequences. Such situation occurred in Holland and we have noticed it many times.  That is all on this issue.   	0
Sorry, but you are mistaken about debt collectors not being able to change information in your credit file. Yes, they can, and yes they do. If my account has been sold (several) times to other people, and my original creditor no longer owns the account, then how would my account be (updated/reported) by that company (debt collector) that purchased it? And, yes they (the person furnishing) the information to the credit bureau can and do supply credit bureaus with fraudulent information. That's how Debt Collector's get sued in the first place.  	0
I also wanted to give an example. It's been like that for 20 years. In fact we have certain flows, at certain times. In relation to the illegal immigrants who come to work in the Netherlands, we've seen that with the Moroccans, with the Turks, well, it's always changing. Now it's the Romanians I know, well... and people are becoming very imaginative. At the time when the Moroccans or the Turks legal were put to work, and it was called by the government in Holland. We were very happy, hooray, we found some of them, and then we brought them back to the country of origin. But they were very clever, because they landed in Belgium with a plane and they were put at the border by the policeman, and then, they went down, and then they made them greet. So a friend waited for them there, they took the car and they came back. In that system, well, I don't know. Now we send them to Greece, and we pay for their airfare. These are all things that our governments are obviously forming?	1
"The biggest issue is that you're challenging your years of knowledge and experience with a small amount of time with the ""opposing view"". If I went from my vim/tmux/rake/ruby/rails/command-line work into VS, I'm sure I would find myself very uncomfortable very quickly. In fact, I know I will because when I did some iOS work in XCode and some Android work in Eclipse, I was very uncomfortable. So, remember that you're not just comparing environments, you're comparing your well-worn, broken-in shoes with a brand new pair from a new manufacturer -- shit ain't just gonna sit right on the first try. Now, that said, the majority of the time I'm doing work on apps, I don't need or use the debugger -- not that I don't have one, but it doesn't come up much. It's a (if you forgive the phrase) paradigm shift. I write my tests and I make them pass. There's not much need for a debugger until I'm plugging through someone else's code and I need to figure things out. But then I have gdb, pry, and the debugger in ruby. Also, I don't ""only"" use a text editor. I use vim as my editor, sure, but even there it's not ""just"" a text editor (though it's a damned fine editor). It's also where I run my tests fromt, it's provides syntax highlighting and code formatting (gg=G to indent and format the whole file is nice), it provides autocomplete, it provides jumping to method and variable definitions. It provides workspace management. It provides automation. I also use tmux, which puts a console into the same terminal as vim (among other things) And coupled with vim, I hit t and it dispatch.vim pops up a split where my tests run. The results are parsed into a nice, usable format that I can automatically jump to the files and lines where the failures are. If I have to quit the terminal, I can jump back to exactly how my terminal was the second I had to quit. I can pair program with someone literally anywhere that internet access exists, completely seamlessly -- they don't even need anything installed on their system past an SSH client. The only way I can justify the ""going back 20 years"" statement is that you think terminals themselves are old. Personally, I think IDEs are garbled, slow messes, so I guess we both have our prejudices. :)"	1
It's true that I think that there is something. There is a real legislation on immigration. But it's not. For me it's just an idea, I can't say that categorically. [1 :	0
Of course I agree with this rule. Of course every country should put on the first place its own citizens. It is true but we should remember not to enter egalitarian system[?] or a system which is based on the exclusion of people. How can we say “no” to people just because they are different? Everybody has a right to have a good quality of life. So how to react when such a problem will appear. Shall we do everything to send this person back to his own country? It is not a matter of the dealing with our citizens, it is about which immigrants we should help in life and which not.	0
Well, I am of the opinion that simply in the population the term EU is seen completely wrong; one always wants only something and one wants to give nothing. I am simply of the opinion that it should be a community and a community simply has to support the weaker ones and the stronger ones simply have to give. I think this is the basic problem of the EU and I think it's very nice that today and in the next few days this could contribute to the fact that this spirit, which was really brought into being by Robert Schuman and by all those who have worked so hard for the EU, could be recognized and a community could really take place; at least in the microcosm now.	0

What concerns aid to the countries of origin of migrants, is something that bothers me a little bit to give financial aid to these countries, is that we should be sure that this aid goes to the people who need it, but there are many of these countries that people leave because they are not democracies and because the money will not go to those who need it but will go to enrich leaders who do not need it. And then anyway you stay in place. So, the generous solution of giving money, I'm not sure that it's the right solution for everyone, there are some countries. But there you go. But how else do you want to do it.	1
"The debt collector who harassed me did that number one on the ""three others"" I got calls saying ""hey we'll settle for"" such and such. It was a medical debt and I was tempted to say why? There is only going to be more medical debt. When times are that difficult for people, making the mortgage and getting medicine takes precedence. I don't think it should be legal for any of these things to happen, and certainly not robo-repeat calling but yet as you read these comments they are going on. I hope this has a good outcome and there will be laws and fines for those companies that do this, because what is available now, suing the debt collector, has not put a dent in their egregious behavior.

I have a little difficulty with the phrase 'we work for others, I work for the whole world, I work for them'. We are talking here about people coming to Germany, people coming here, people having a job here. We are talking here on the whole; we are actually supposed to be talking about illegals in quotation marks, who have drifted into illegality because their visa has expired. That is, these people do have jobs. I don't believe that the employer no longer employs them, then they wouldn't be here. These are people who are employed - and it's not about someone coming here, what Udo said, the economic refugees who come here to say, I'm better off here - in quotes - than somewhere else. But we're talking about EU here, not Germany.	0
I have already spoken with an attorney. This is how I found out about the separation of state and federal law. Because I was sued in state civil court is why my validation requests were ignored by the plaintiffs as well as the seating judge. What I should have done (in state court) was sent a 'discovery' request AFTER the case had been filed rather then a validation request. Please note - the 'collection agency' was a large legal firm. They knew the laws well and whereas I was a lay person and not versed in law , I was like a sitting duck just waiting for the slaughter. If I did take them to court I would receive hundreds but it would cost me thousands.... and I just do not have that type of money. What really touched my heart was sitting in that court room and seeing others that also thought that the law would be fair if they represented themselves. Needless to say, we all lost and lost big time. I asked the judge why would he allow this when the plaintiff was a unlicensed collection agency and he stated ' they look like attorneys to me'. I knew that at that point I had lost my case.  	1
But there are also immigrants that are coming from non-EU countries and other countries where the systems are different. Sometimes we do not even know if there is any government in their countries. Police is sometimes saying that not all can have the same status. They need passer[passport?] and this passer should help them to find a job but the employer exploits them in a bad way. During the years such a person can be exploited by its employer. People are even scared to go to the police because they are in this country illegally. This causes that they are trapped in. Their illegal status is extending. They do not know their rights and are exploited. They are not strong enough to ask for help. So according to this situation, it is better for them to stay in the country from where they came. Especially when they are coming because of economic reasons. If we are talking about the centres for immigrants, like they exist in Australia. They were founded in the desert and people there were treated like criminals. It is not a good idea. If we want to help them, we should help them to better integrate in the society. This is much better than creating ghettos or camps. Our country does not have so many economic opportunities to give immigrants a job. This is also important to notice.[8:44]	0
"I got hit with a notice from a doctor's office and his collection agency that I owed and -- get this -- never responded to their notices. First, I never got any notices and second, I called the doctor's office and validated that I have never been a patient there. The office manager even wrote a letter to the collection agency. It was clearly THEIR mistake, The collection agency got all hot and bothered and rude to me because then they had to pay to remove the notice of me ""owing"" a debt from the three credit reporting agencies boy I hope you go after these cowboys next -- and yet it was removed. But while waiting for the letter, I managed to actually get someone on the phone from Equifax, I was so angry, and their attitude was, ""we just report this"" blah blah blah. I say there ought to be sanctions, monetary sanctions, against these credit reporting agencies for making these mistakes and their cavalier attitude. They have this attitude of, so what? This has been more than two years ago and still seethe because of the cavalier and rude attitude when it was clearly their mistake. I even called MY eye doctor and had him write a letter that I was HIS patient. You think things don't get out of hand?

Only here is the question that Poland and Slovenia are not rich countries compared to, let’s say, France or Germany.

I think that if the country is a EU-member, the EU-leaders should assist its member states in the case of immigrants. 	0
A clarification on what? On what topic?   so I'll repeat it again in concise words. I don't think it's good for any country to lose skilled workers, and it's not good for any country to systematically lose workers. And if we allow these people to systematically come into our countries from any country, we will have done something for our economy, but these countries will then become poor and we will then have poor stragglers. If we allow poor people to come from these countries, we produce problems in our countries. Of course, the southern European countries have bigger problems with that because they are closer to Africa or also closer to the Arabian Peninsula and yes, that's just a geographical phenomenon.	0
I wanted to go to the legal and illegal immigration... I can also understand that well, if someone lives for example in Africa or another country and you get it now. And then someone also says, these antennas, and especially through the media, just also then you see: the people are better off than me and I'm doing badly, I have nothing to eat and I mean, it's just the most human thing that you then think: I also want to try my luck there. I think there are also many theories that if something doesn't happen soon that stops the impoverishment in Africa, at least that stops something, that the flood will become more and more and that more and more people will come, which is understandable. So I mean, if we had nothing to eat, then we would also look, where do we get something to eat, where do we get what the others have. The problem is, of course, that we, especially Spain, are in a situation where the entire system is not geared to this, in that when many people come, they also want to have something, and you can't plan for that. Of course, you can not manage properly. That is the big problem that I see. And what I just wanted to say about the prisons: this is now a bit of a step backwards, but I find that in the prisons - Well, I was already once in a prison, not because I was inside, but only as a visitor and it is not nice inside and I was there maybe half an hour and I do not think that the prisons in Spain are much better than the German prisons. And you have to make sure that human rights are respected in the prisons and that we are a democracy and that's part of it. That something like that is also secured. Yes.	0
So, on this subject. It's very good, we should compensate all these countries. I agree with that. But there is so much corruption and bureaucracy, we've known for years about helping them, we've had years of project cooperation, of NGOs and every day there is little corruption and little bureaucracy. So, in the end, the bureaucracy takes everything that can be ordered. So we have to find a solution that is not direct to these countries. We must find a solution so that the money is not sucked up by the bureaucracy but rather in the (...), in agriculture, in things that finally create jobs, quite simply.	0
I agree. It's a measure that seems feasible to me, first of all, because you always have to imagine that you can do, you can control and these are measures that are difficult to falsify. Again, is this a useful? In my opinion, with the technical technology we have today, which can be quite effective, but always the solution we propose must be followed by the facts. Another general weakness in all countries - I imagine - is when laws are passed and not applied! This is a useful thing in my opinion that is correct: biometric identity cards, I don't know what it means exactly but it is something that allows each entrant, each resident to be known and it is something that can be applied provided that it is really applied.	0

"Once I tell a debt collector I am a unpaid CareGiver and that is why I had to stop making payments, In essence they were telling me to let my parents die if necessary and go get a job. I was repeatedly baited with the comment, ""So you are a ""refuse to pay"". I found this type of conduct outside the lines of common decency. I had a business, I had to give up the business to become an unpaid CareGiver. If I had been shown at the time I apparently agreed to the credit card agreement that there truly were no ifs ands or buts in regards to monthly payments forgiveness on an ""unsecured"" debt, I would have come up with a different business model that did not require credit card debt. Credit card companies get to present themselves as pro family in their advertising when the exact opposite is true in times of crisis. Ask people who had a dramatic life changing incident occur how the credit card companies treated them. Ask the Colorado flood victims, or the Hurricane Sandy Victims, or the person who was the victim of a hit and run how the credit card companies treated them. These are the same credit card companies that lobbied the comptroller of the currency in 2002 to keep their monopoly on credit card debt suspension insurance and the outrageous overpriced premiums they were charging their customers. One of the best ways consumers had to be responsible regarding their credit card debts was having AFFORDABLE credit card debt suspension insurance. This option was stolen from consumers in 2002 when the comptroller of the currency allowed credit card companies to over charge by 1000% to 2000% on monthly credit card debt suspension insurance premiums. I created a time line document that shows how the financial elite stole fairness from the people in regards to credit card products.

I think GMO's are not only safe, but that the controversy surrounding them is largely conspiracy nonsense fueled by anger at Monsanto's business practices. CMV? Humans have been adapting the food we grow for as long as we've had the slightest knowledge of genetics. Everything from gene manipulation to selective breeding is a type of genetic modification, meaning it's difficult if not impossible to buy any food humans haven't modified genetically to fit our needs. I can't help but feel that the bad press surrounding genetically modified food (or more accurately, food that has had its genes artificially manipulated in the lab, since that's the only type of GMO anyone seems to care about) is borne of foodies and conspiracy nuts, and fanned by everyone's hatred of Monsanto for their (admittedly terrible) business practices.

When you've been doing the hokey-pokey from emergency room to nursing home and back again over a period of months, that information is not much help. What's really needed is an itemized bill that's a lot clearer than the ""statement of benefits"" we get now. Something as clear as: ""You were in X hospital on this date. You had this test and that test. They cost a gazillion dollars, but we bargained them down to $17.48. Please pay this amount.""  "	1
"I think there should be a fed law that should clearly state that any partial payment might revive the SOL for suit. How consumers get a phone call/letter telling them they have a debt and they just blindly pay it or make partial payments in order to just stop getting the phone calls? Lots. And the debt might not even be theirs, but they pay it anyways thinking that they might have a old debt that they forgot to take care of. The problem with that is, that the debt then is revived, the debt collector sues, and the judge tells the debtor ""well, if this wasn't your debt then why did you agree to make partial payments?"" Then the judge will make favor in the debt collector for a revived debt that the debtor was not even responsible for in the first place. This scenario happens every day of the week. And the consumer had thought they were doing the right thing, but the debt collector is actually taking advantage.  "	0

... Indeed, we can take up an idea that has already been put forward in relation to, in fact, the problem of how to welcome immigrants and on what criteria between [...]. But in a more general way [...] it is to ask the question of what generates this migratory movement. Well, the migratory movement we have always had. All along the history of the world. But today, to take the example of Africa, I believe that it is in Senegal where there are many young men who take the sea to reach Europe. These men die at sea. And these Senegalese women who have mobilized to do everything possible to retain their men today. So it's true that we can eventually do actions, there are actions that a development moreover one that set up by the French government to help the assembly of projects on the spot. So we are talking about countries that generate a lot of immigration. But there we are also confronted with the logic of means because especially in times of crisis where the financial issue becomes more and more crucial. There is also a mobilization that must be facilitated at the level of these countries so that the countries take charge of identifying the motivations of the shares and then make sure that the populations do not move. So there are different reasons; health reasons, economic reasons and political reasons. It is sure that, whatever solution we put in place at the European level, we will not be able to solve the motivation of migration. So it's true, it's in the law of Europe, it's, what is interesting is that Europe plays a role in [...] on the moderation of migratory flows I think. That is really a political role so that globally we can regulate these migratory movements.	1
I believe SMBC put it best: Also, it's interesting how the government can dare to spy on its citizens, but the citizens don't yet have the right to a fully transparent government.

"I do not plan on voting. CMV For context, I am a seventeen-year-old living in the United States. When I turn 18, I plan to register as an independent; when election days come around, I intend to go to the polling location and submit a blank ballot. I intend to remain somewhat politically involved aside from voting, at least to the extent of knowing what the issues are and where I stand on them. Here are my reasons for not voting: Voting, at least in the United States encourages an us-versus-them mentality, creating a vicious atmosphere. As a quick example of this, /r/politics was focused almost entirely on tearing Mitt Romney and the Republicans down last election season, building them up as the most evil people on the face of the planet. The voter is asked to accept a political party's complete list of economic and social ideals. You cannot separate individual issues at all--you have a few packages to choose from, no matter how much you may disagree with parts of each. By the very nature of this, voters are encouraged to agree with one side on all or almost all things. Because a person chooses to support a side, views presented by that side will tend to appear ""better"" than views presented by the other side, regardless of the views themselves. People who join and actively support one political party or another submit to a certain degree of mob mentality. The United States has many corrupt government officials and something of a culture of dissatisfaction with elected officials. I see this, in large part, as a result of voting. Voting selects for traits such as charisma, popular appeal, and so forth, rather than competency in governing. In addition, the process encourages--almost necessitates--lying. Even once officials have jumped through the hoops required for their elections, they will often make decisions based on what certain groups of their constituents want. You see this in actions such as the Republicans calling for a repeal of Obamacare (perhaps not the best example, but the first decent one I thought of): absurd proposals with no chance of succeeding, created purely to show that the politicians uphold the views of those who voted for them. Beyond all this, voting itself depends on the people, and that is perhaps my biggest problem with it. Everybody is encouraged to vote. If a person doesn't vote (and makes that clear), they are generally looked down upon--often considered unworthy of even holding political opinions. Becoming politically informed is given much lower priority. As I see it, this results in people voting when they really shouldn't be--voting not because they care, not because they have honestly and thoroughly researched and come to the conclusion that Candidate A is superior to Candidate B, but because it's expected. This gives the informed votes much less value--every thoughtful vote is drowned out by a dozen thoughtless ones. Building on that, voting gives people a sense of having ""done their political duty."" It is an entirely symbolic gesture--individual votes, of course, do not carry any weight at all--but it frees them from doing any more politically. If you're a voter, you've Done Your Part to support the democracy! I could go on, but this post is getting too long as it is. The reasons above should provide a good start, at least. In short, I prefer the symbolic gesture of not voting to the symbolic gesture of voting because I see a lot of systemic problems caused by the act and concept of voting. I am fairly firm in this viewpoint. I am posting in /r/changemyview because it is an abnormal viewpoint and I have held it for long enough that I suspect I am not giving fair consideration to points that support voting. I do not expect my view to change completely, but I would appreciate a different perspective on things."	1
I'm guessing you're American. Apologies if I'm wrong. Here's a few specific milestones I can think of. 25 - Pretty much everyone will now rent you a car without making you pay absurd rates. 26 - Significant drop in car insurance premiums, especially if you're a male. 32 - You're age is a power of 2! You can go around saying that you're 10000 years old! I am looking forward to this 35 - Minimum age of office for some positions, including president.	0

We talked about Iran and other countries, well, the systems, the political systems were different, the systems no longer exist thanks to the support of the EU and the US. One example, of course, is the Taliban. Religious fundamentalism, it was not bad for us at that time, for the Western countries it was something very useful, because we could manipulate other peoples, like the Russians, the former Soviet Union, so that's what I wanted to say.	1
[34: [33:] I think it's not very easy to find a denominator within the European Union, because the immigration problems within the different countries of the European Union are not the same, for example in Italy, in Spain, they have strong pressures from immigration from Africa, for example I live in Austria, there we have the German immigrants so they have the same aspect as us, it's the accent that changes - no end, we don't really have problems with them, so joke apart. In any case, Austria for decades has welcomed mostly people from the former Yugoslavia who physically have the same aspects as us and besides the second generation, the children, are very well integrated but obviously there are countries that have real problems and real problems and there are countries that for decades, as I said, have known the phenomenon of immigration and there are others that are really in vogue of immigration and there are [those] that, that [will] still know this phenomenon in the future.	1

As a banker in a small bank, I have been on both sides of the collection business. Bankers have to prove a debt and give consumers a chance of object to the validity. When I have had collection agencys contact us for medical collections, I found these people to be scum. They don't care if the debt is valid, correct, or anything else. They just know that they get 50% of everything they collect. You can request that they not contact you again, but they will. My suggestion is that collection agencies not be allowed to call at all and all correspondence be in writing. If anyone can tell me what I owe and why I owe it, I will pay it. They can't and they don't care.  	1
The pensions, they are not secured either. But our planet, it's overpopulated - there are too many of us. We have I think ten or twelve billion of our kind in this world and they all want to eat and when we say something like that now; busy children - understandable, but at some point we're going to put up a big cooking pot and feed the fellow humans like it was with the old dinosaurs; the last ones were still eating each other.	0
Often I find myself following the opinion of the mass. When I see a comment is controversial, I become especially critical to what is being said. And when I see a comment that has a very good upvote downvote ratio I rarely disagree, because I don't expect myself to. So I think it forces people to think more for themselves and not follow the hive mind. It's true that the sort order wasn't changed, this is necessary to not change the concept of Reddit's upvote system too much. It's a good compromise in my opinion, especially for discussion based subreddits like CMV.	1

"There's a pretty big leap between saying that you don't ""get"" modern art, and denying altogether that its even art. &gt;Articles like this one[7] , where a forger created dozens of works supposedly by various modern artists, and managed to fool critics, art historians and collectors, just reinforces my view. That ""forger"" was also trained at an art school. That person is a fraud for passing off his own paintings as those of more famous artists, but to do so required skill, talent, insight, and hard work."	0
"I believe people should not be allowed to bring babies in a movie theater except if it's a special ""everybody can bring their babies"" showing/theater. CMV People pay a lot of money ($30+ for two tickets and a pop to share for me and the wife) to have a bit of an escape from day-to-day life for a few hours. The experience is is enjoyable when someone so much as texts or talks during the movie...it is a downright miserable experience if someone brings their baby and it either starts making cooing noises or starts crying and the parent either does nothing or tries to get the baby to stop crying while still in the theater instead of taking it outside or thinking ""hey I'm probably ruining everybody's experience, I'll just cut my losses and go home"". I think theater chains should refuse patrons with babies unless it's a rated G movie. Empire Theatres in Canada has a ""Reel Babies"" showing for certain movies so parents can take their babies and not worry about disturbing others. I don't care if you really, really want to see the new Hobbit movie or whatever. I don't care if you can't find a baby sitter...those are the sacrifices you have to make when you have kids. Your wanting to see a movie does not entitle you to ruin everyone else's experience that they paid money for. Wait till the DVD/Blu-Ray comes out or see movies at special ""everyone can bring their babies"" showings."	0

I have had debt collectors call and tell me that I am not cooperating to get the debt resolved, yell at me, tell me I must be lazy or not understand I owe the money. They have called me from 7:00 am to 9:00pm at least 10 times during the day using a different company name, different phone number and location including my city and other cities and states all in the same day. When I tell them I am a senior they tell me to borrow the money from a family member or friend. When I tell them I am not going to do that the harrassment starts all over. Many of them call and act like I am an old friend before they tell me who they are. They threaten to ruin my credit raiting, confiscate my home and belonging and car, The most annoying is when they call and I answer they hang up and call again an hr later and hang up again. I know it is them because I have caller id.  	1
"I believe it is wrong to push your morals on someone else CMV. The only moral that I have ever tried to press on others is not to press your morals on others. A contradiction, I know, but a necessary one. I have always held the belief that I am intrinsically incapable of determining whether or not my own opinions are indeed the correct opinions to have. I simply cant, with any factual evidence tell you that I am morally superior. The only thing that I can, with absolute certainty, tell you; is that I lack to capability to be absolutely certain of anything. Which means neither can you, or anyone else alive for that matter. We are all painfully unknowing. To look at the morals of someone else and say ""I am right, you are wrong, change,"" is suggesting at the most basic level that you are certain that you are correct and superior, which you are intrinsically not. In doing this you elevate yourself to a level that god may not even occupy which, to me, is quite unsavory."	0
Illegal immigration problems are quite difficult because it is hard to identify how many people in a certain country are working illegally. Maybe we should start with organizing special institutions which deal with controlling employers who are employing illegal immigrants. Maybe if it worked out, we would be able to create a system of support for illegal immigrants. If they are not able to work in a certain country, maybe we could support them somehow in their own country. It is difficult to say but I think it would be the best option.	0

Yes, I refer to immigration. You talk about Europe giving the impression to these poor people that we are a paradise and so on. But I don't think that it is only our notion of wealth and easy life that attracts many of these poor people. I think that if there is a factor that is often forgotten, it is that we are at peace. And I think that this word, peace, has not been said. Somewhere, I met, not long ago, someone who returned, I don't know from which country, who told me that you, you don't even realize what it is, peace. And some people who flee their country, it is not only because of the attraction of the paradise of France, Germany, Europe or other, because they know that they will struggle, that it will be difficult. They are afraid, they take months to come from Afghanistan to France and then to Great Britain. It's a nightmare, they get ripped off, they pay 15,000 dollars, imagine that, 15,000 euros to get from Afghanistan to the United Kingdom in three months, with periods of imprisonment, because they get caught in Greece, on the right and on the left. These people, before all, before wealth, before El Dorado, they are looking for a safe haven in my opinion.	1
So legalizing illegal immigrants, question to Rudolf:  How do you imagine that? So how many millions from Ukraine, from Africa, etc.? So we're going to legalize everyone who comes - very good. As I said before. They come to our house and everyone who comes can stay 5 years, can live with you for 5 years. That's not right. I would like to have a position. How do you see this?	0
Clear communication helps everyone, not just consumers. I think debt collectors when trying to collect just send bills, and everyone knows what a bill is. But when they devolve into harassment, they blur the lines between trying to collect debt within the law and behaving in misleading and abusive ways toward consumers. TRuly, the robot calling, the letters, they have money enough for this. If they communicated clearly up front, they would save more money. The post office is still a good deal, not an expensive way to communicate. You are missing the boat on the problem, though. It is not the costs or whether they should communicate. Most of these companies hire people who are barely literate, poorly trained and certainly uninformed -- wait, UNINFORMED -- about the laws that already exist regarding debt collection. That is a huge problem when trying to get information from an employee who doesn't know the law requires him/her to provide certain information. This has come about from decades of lack of oversight, in my opinion. Lack of oversight, lack of clear rules and lack of enforcement. So, if they don't have to worry about following the law, they hire whoever they can cheap and don't bother to train them. This is why there are so many of these companies and after some of them do get in trouble, they just change their name and keep on doing the same law-breaking habits.  	0

An illegal, of course, will not enter through the legal border. Either he will come by ship, by boat, or he will swim or something. Or at the Turkish border, maybe he will go over the mountains. He will not go across a legal, an official border. At the border points, it's clear that if he doesn't have a passport, he can't get in. But there are other ways to get into a country.	0
I would like to add something to this. Indeed, to tell you the truth, in Holland, immigration is perceived as something that hangs over our heads and that we carry out in any context of the discussion. Maybe knowing about it, the EU should take care of it, so that other countries, which do not have that kind of problems yet, such as Poland for instance, would contribute in order to solve this problem together. So that at least we could share the knowledge and experience in this matter. I think we should cooperate like that. 	0
Lets check how we can do research about a single person. This person is saying that: „I came to this country because I would like to have a better life”. So this person is coming to Germany where people are telling him: “Ok, you want to have a better life but we do not have more space here, better go to Poland or to Slovenia”. Maybe this person would not want to go to Poland or Slovenia…I was thinking more about the people from the non-EU countries. Borders are open now between our countries, we should not forget about that. I meant about the persons which are coming from the EU countries which can make this problem. Some people are coming from countries where they have war and we needed to help them. However, if there are immigrants who came only because of economic reasons, we would have to choose which one we want to take or not. If someone really needs help, asylum, then the EU should really do something. Maybe the EU should create rules so the countries would know what to do with immigrants in such cases. There are some people who can not start a new life, no matter if they are in England or Poland, but they also can not go back to their own countries in safety. 	0
&gt; Most marriages end in divorce anyway. This is like the 5th time I've heard this in the past two days, and I don't know why people keep repeating it without checking their sources. This is not true. There was one study done over the course of one year that found there was one divorce for every two marriages. There were no follow up studies to confirm it the findings. It fails to take into account that people who divorce once are more likely to do so again in subsequent marriages. Based on this alone, the actual number is estimated to be 30 percent of people go through at least one divorce in their lifetime, but again that hasn't been empirically confirmed. And it also said nothing about the demographics of who is getting married or divorced. The couple getting married in vegas at 21 isn't going to have the same odds as the college graduate couple getting married at 28. There are a lot of factors to consider. It's not true that most marraiges end in divorce, and more importantly, most people who take their time in a relationship and treat it as the serious matter it is will not get divorced. &gt; In my own family, my great grand parents divorced, so did my grandparents and so did my parents. My parents are divorced, so were the parents of my two best friends growing up, and my wife's parents are not divorced but they don't' get along. And none of this matters, it's all anecdotal. When you look at the larger trends, most people don't get divorced. &gt; This is an important question because I want to raise a kid someday. I believe the economic and financial stability of a two parent household is probably best for kids, but I have no interest in monogamy, nor could I ever pretend to believe I will want to be with the same person for my entire life. This is where [opportunity cost]( comes in. Either you can raise kids in a stable, two parent household and spend ~18 years with the same person, or you can give up monogamy and be with lots of people. Neither of these is a bad option, but it's going to be very difficult to have both at the same time, and so you have to decide which is more important to you, and you may have to make sacrifices. You may find your priorities change as you get older.	1
"The fundamental flaw with your reasoning is that you assume that an action has to be justified. Do I also have to justify my love of pepperoni pizza? How about my coffee in the morning? Do I have to justify buying a BMW because, ""I find it baffling that anyone would consciously choose to ~~drink alcohol~~ buy a BMW for any reason any other ~~drink~~ car could also fill.""? Certainly not. If that were true, then I could likewise make you justify your decision *not* to drink. Alcohol is a dangerous drug if it's abused. It certainly can lead people to make poor decisions, and can even lead to death. It appears that what you have an issue with is alcoholism or binge drinking, not drinking alcohol itself. The two are very different. As with many things, moderation is the key. Personally, I don't drink very often - maybe once a month. I enjoy the taste of a finely blended whisky or a very old Scotch. Your statement that any other drink or any other action could fill the same purpose as a glass of The Glenlivet 18 year is simply untrue. The key is to drink responsibly. You control the drink, don't let the drink control you. If you can't do that, then you're not mature enough to drink."	1
Well, I think the situation in Denmark is as follows: The political parties look at the rules that are handled in the different countries and we then try to work together to solve problems also on the European level. We have had some difficulties with refugees coming to Denmark in boats and also with immigrants. That is something that also again has an impact on the different countries, the situation is different.	1

"&gt; I can't enjoy failing like some people can. Guess what dude? Nobody in the history of ever has enjoyed failing. By definition it is not the outcome you wanted, and it just plain sucks. But I don't think that's your real problem. If I had to take a guess (and I don't *really* have to, but I will anyway), I'd say that maybe your problem is that you've somehow gotten your sense of self-worth tied into your success or failure. So then every time you fail at something, your mind is all like, ""see, you're totally worthless and you might as well just crawl in a hole and die."" But everything seems awesome when you're succeeding. If, indeed, that is the issue, this is far beyond what a bunch of internet strangers can fix for you. You could try therapy I guess--that seems to be the standard thing that people recommend for issues of this sort. But I'm going to suggest something else, just for the sake of being different. Go practice mindfulness meditation. The whole point of this exercise is *literally* to focus on the journey, and your success at this exercise is determined largely by your ability to stop thinking about whether or not you're winning. It will probably suck less if you can find a group of people to meditate with who will give you feedback. Groups like that tend to be around in lots of areas though."	0
Well, I think that in Germany, in principle, we have less problems with illegal, I keep emphasizing illegal immigration. That we have less problems there than, for example, Italy or Spain. So, I think that is certain. But we could have problems à la longue if we don't support the Italians and the Spaniards in solving this problem. If we say it is none of our business, we are the Germans, we have no problem with it. Do you understand what I mean by that?	0
That is not going to work. The burden of proof in the American Justice System is bore by the one who is making the accusations. Some debtors are going to lie and say that a debt is not theirs when it actually is, but that is the nature of the beast with debt collections. Innocent until proven guilty is the rules of the game. Otherwise I, as a debt collector, can accuse anyone of anything owning any amount and extort money from innocent people. Debt collection is about collecting debt, not about making accusations and extortions.  	0
I think we will also find intersections between the issue tomorrow and today. Because the topic of climate change; and this is based a little bit on what Manuel said; eliminating climate change and also creating conditions everywhere equally, also means investing in education, in economy, both in our country and in our neighboring countries outside the EU. So that probably tomorrow we will discover points of intersection, possibly even find solutions for both problems. Is just a hope.	0
"Compliance 2013 demonstrates the type of arrogance that I have been addressing in my prior comments. The belief that a default is a default by courts along with the practice of REWARDING Strategic Defaulters while sentencing INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS to never ending escalating debt because of the ongoing interest rate charges needs to be addressed.

I think that the countries that are affected, are in the peripheral areas of the European Union and to which also most immigrate, illegally or legally, that one should help the countries and vice versa one should then have the same conditions for all countries and then also distribute the burdens accordingly and produce guidelines, for all. Because the EU countries that are in the middle, they are a bit luckier than those on the outside, but they have to, should keep out those from third countries. And that is then too much for the countries, alone too much.	0
Yes, I think it is difficult to make such considerations, because the cost of living or the level of living in general - if you want to compare everything with each other, then you have to admit that the Germans in Germany live better with their income than the Poles with their income, which is considerably lower - even if many expenses are correspondingly lower.	1
"I have a debt in dispute with the CFPB, and it has not yet been resolved, but during the government shutdown the Original Creditor turned it over to a collection agency. The collection agency has not contacted me in writing at all, but they did a hard pull on my credit report. I legitimately closed the account when it was paid in full, but they continued billing me after I had cancelled the service. Now the matter is simply snowballing. I am very upset about this. If a consumer is in the midst of a dispute with the CFPB, I would think there would be a ""time out"" on collection actions and especially malicious hard pull of the credit report while the dispute is ongoing.

I think it's good that you bring the American example. We know, North America, own continent with two borders. They build a wall to the south, to Mexico with thousands of deaths. To the north, there is Canada, they don't need one. The Federal Republic of Germany is surrounded, is surrounded by friends, by EU members. There are highways. And in Germany you can drive without speed limit. And there you drive namely - from Austria, from Belgium, from Switzerland, even in the meantime - you drive smoothly through. I drive from Germany, Bavaria to Austria with 120 or 150 if I want to. Do we want to build borders again? The problem cannot be solved in this way. With border controls, dear Mario, is in Europe - we have 27 dwarf states in comparison, does not work at all; we would have a rat tail of costs, we would have walls, it is already enough the wall around the Palestinians, we can not do, first. Secondly, I have to emphasize again because we are in the EU, we are no longer talking about Spanish, Portuguese workers, because these are not immigrants, but these are EU citizens, that you finally keep it apart.	0
I'm a woman, and I'm very critical of Twilight because the writing is horrible. In addition to the bad writing, it's a thinly-veiled pro-life parable that encourages young women to be weak and submissive. In comparison, The Hunger Games is well written and features a strong female character. You don't see nearly as much vitriol directed at this series, in spite of the fact that they are aimed at similar audiences. I attribute this to the fact that the writing is much better and the lead is powerful, talented, and smart all on her own. She isn't reliant upon a man to provide her with self worth. She's not chasing the men around, begging for their affection, and trying to kill herself because she is rebuffed. She's a self-assured badass. When you say that young women are able to tell fact from fiction, I agree. This is not the problem with Twilight. The problem is that it acts as an agent of socialization. Young women internalize the idea that loving someone means being submissive, devoted to the point of self-destruction. It's a dangerous concept for young women to internalize, just as it's dangerous for young men to think it's okay to treat women as sex objects without feelings. As a society, we discourage our young people from viewing certain behaviors in a positive light through negative sanctions, and I think that's what's happening here. I also hated The Da Vinci code because the writing was atrocious. Same with 50 shades of gray. There is a lot of bad prose out there.	0
It's up to the couple and the mutual intent of the relationship. There is more than one type of relationship and none of them are asinine. Relationships range from one night stands to monogamous marriage and everything in between. Want monogamy? Find someone who wants monogamy. Don't want monogamy? Don't get into a monogamous relationship. I personally don't want sex with anyone but my love. If she wants sex with other people it's fine, but it's a sign that we have different goals and feel different about each other. If she values sex with other people over what we have together than the relationship is over. If we don't have the same goals and the same perspective on monogamy then we probably shouldn't plan on being together for very long. Some people like swinger parties, casual sex with strangers and having fuck buddies. Some people have sex for a living and still manage to have meaningful relationships. It's just a matter of your personal relationship and what your goals are as a couple.	1
Thanks to the EU free movement of workers between the countries, movement is big enough so the immigration problem should be minimal. We also in Poland and Slovenia are leaving to other countries where we are also treated by Great Britain, English, like illegal immigrants in their countries. It is just how we are treating Ukrainians. However, because of that we have a movement of workers and these jobs mix with each other. So we should not look if this is Ukrainian or Polish. We all should be treated equally. In England for example we are treated equally like English people. We have equal rights. I know that this is the EU and that the eastern Europe does not yet belong to the EU but in my opinion this work migration is big enough and everyone can fin something for himself.	1
I would say that this question has been put wrongly, because we do not have the amounts, we cannot spend them. Let us change this question. If you do not have immigrants, what will you spend the money on? What would we spend on? Of course the local community, that is obvious, but first you have to have that money, or maybe I am wrong.   	0
I totally agree with what the previous speakers said. It is good that we talk about it, about immigration. There is also labour, professional, vocational immigration but this fits into a broader context.  Appropriately equal distribution of goods and wealth, which is being worked out in European frames. Resources to develop labour markets in Europe and its poorest regions need to be founded, so that people would not need to leave and immigration would not be a noticeable problem. Of course, it cannot be solved right away, but I think that it is a fundamental issue. 	0
Good idea debt neutrality. But the sad thing is, being in debt is NOT considered a crime however, the way the laws are now, and the abuses these collection agencies engage in, you might as well be considered a criminal. I agree. Set up a system where the consumer is on equal footing with the debt collectors.  	0
I'm a little ashamed, I can't compare much. I think that all immigrants who want to work, should have the right to come and settle. Now, if they come with other thoughts that are not those of work, then they should not come, they should stay at home. I live in the Canary Islands, in La Gomera, and there is a lot of immigration, a lot of makeshift boats arriving on the coast. And lately, there have been more and more people arriving. I have the impression that they were able to get along quite well. I have the impression that they adapted easily, they studied, they adapted to the local color. Didn't cause any trouble at all from there. We treated them well, they did the same. That's all I have to say.	1
I totally agree with the moderator that we should talk about immigration from outside Europe, but the question is whether the member countries have already welcomed the flow of immigration into Europe. Because this also influences the question in Europe, whether we can still accept other people from outside Europe because of this. One of the points that arise is: an argument against the liberation of immigration, that also leads to all kinds of desires of calamity. A lesser acceptance by the Europeans by some people that makes the integration also groups to the society that will come more and more painful. And that, in itself puts then to other problems. So this process, according to me, it is not necessary to start it. One of the conditions to lead the migration from outside of Europe is to regulate the migration flow in the center of Europe as well. On condition.	0
"I would like to say that I come from a city, Villeurbanne, which is next to Lyon, which is a city that, in 1900 in the 30's when it developed, welcomed a lot of immigrants, especially Spaniards and Italians, and we even have a street in Villeurbanne that is called ""la rue des bienvenus"". That is to say that by the name of a street, we welcome them. In my culture, Spanish and Italian immigrants have been very important. They were part of my culture and I enjoyed being around them. So I think that Europe should be a common skin space where all cultures can meet, mix and enrich each other. Now, on the question of immigration; itself, in particular of the non-European immigrants, who come on the territory of Europe, and who I find brings us the same enrichment as, I say, other populations, the question that I ask myself is basically that I always asked myself: When an immigrant comes to a country, does he not impoverish the country from which he leaves. This is the question I ask myself and obviously if I ask it, I have the answer: In general, it is the most dynamic people who make the superhuman effort to leave the country where they are. This was the case in the countries of war, there were only people who were a little dynamic, risking to be killed or to be caught by crossing the borders and I find that their country of origin misses them a lot. So that's it. That's the question I ask myself. Are we not impoverishing countries that are already poor by taking the best of their population?"	1
I think your idea is an excellent one. My concern is that it might force interest rates even higher. Ideally, there would probably be less overall defaults if consumers, when first getting credit were required to pay at least 5% of the total due each and every month.  	0
Yes, I would just like to add that, in relation to the selection, I would like to make one point, that is the language. Perhaps beforehand, impose a minimum of language training when entering a country because I live in Paris and not far from there is a district where there is a large immigrant population. And I unfortunately hear - and I have the impression more and more - immigrants talking to each other about their language of origin and it's true, for an integration it's not the best thing. So I know quite a few people who arrive in France and even if some of them learn the language, they don't speak French practically. So I think that it's not [...] integration. That's it.	1
Probably won't find any legislation since people who have allegedly defaulted on a debt aren't necessarily going to tell the world, or create a lobby for their cause. Debt Defaults and Debt Collections are a one sided issue in which judges have been constrained to simply determine if a default has occurred, or not. The lawyers primarily work with strategic defaulters because S.D.'s have some source of money or income available to pay both the attorney and a partial portion of the debt. Involuntary Defaulters are left to fend for themselves because they don't have money to pay a lawyer. Debt Neutrality, in which an involuntary defaulter agrees they owe the debt and simply want's to be able to pay it down based on the amount the debt was at the time of the default, with no more penalties, interest rate charges, or fees, even if it takes 10 years to pay off the debt, would possibly alleviate a large amount of unnecessary court cases. And of course, once the very modest initial payments were set up, the account would no longer register as a negative on a debtor's credit score or credit rating. And to safeguard fraud, the debtor would not be able to keep borrowing larger and larger amounts of money until after their defaults were paid in full. It's a very logical solution in my opinion. Judges should be able to use logic to solve the growing backlog of credit card default cases.  	0
Yes, not exactly. So I didn't agree with one thing Thomas said. So immigration for me is primarily a national problem. However, as Thomas said, there every country actually has a different, a different kind of immigration problem, that's true. In the south of Spain, in southern Europe, not only, but also in Spain, we have African immigrants, as you know, we also have many immigrants from Latin American countries still. And, maybe we have a bigger problem there than the more northern countries. We have more Colombians and Ecuadorians than anywhere else in Europe and we actually have to start there with a national policy, maybe set a certain minimum threshold or maximum threshold for immigrants and once that's settled, then maybe we can move to a European policy.	1
I think that - so I already agree with you to some extent - but in Spain at least, I don't know how it is in other countries, I think we do invest relatively a lot in people. They have a lot of advantages that you and I don't have. They came from abroad and they want that. At a certain point, what happens then is that they might be rejected. But, for example, when a company comes from abroad, they have a whole set of tax advantages that we don't have. That leads to it not being as well received. Now we also have from people doing work that we don't want to do. Yes, well, that certainly happens, but not always. Very often we don't take the work because it's very poorly paid. We should perhaps ask ourselves if the entrepreneur does not share a great debt. We should work out a policy of immigration on a national level and then extend it to the European Union, but everyone should share the burden. We hear that Denmark also has problems, but at some point everyone should bear their share.	1
If the citizens in this country cannot find a job, how can we give work to foreigners? I believe that a priority should be given to people from that country. I just wanted to add. 	0
Debt collectors should not be permitted to harass a debtor's ex-spouse by repeatedly calling the ex-spouse. Debt collectors are known to use the old phone number of the debtor that now belongs to the ex-spouse exclusively. Even though the ex-spouse tells the collector to remove her phone number from the collector's records, the collector does not, and then repeatedly calls her trying to get to the debtor. Collectors must be required to remove her phone number from their records at her first request and not be permitted to call her again. Otherwise, she has no recourse to get the harassment to stop.  	0
I do not believe that Psychology is a valid science. CMV I'm of the opinion that Psychology is not a valid science because it cannot observe or test empirical data. I believe that all forms of Psychology that study the external effects of the internal operation of the *mind* are very literally only guesses based on precedent guessing, cannot be verified absolutely, and are most likely opinions formed of the observer's textbook prejudices. I also believe that observations made based on mechanical and chemical differences in the *brain* fall under the valid studies of Neuroscience, and are often used wrongly to justify Psychology. I feel that the field does not advance as sciences do, and that while Clinical, Experimental, and Academic Psychology are the most egregious offenders, all observations are at the complete mercy of the subject's ability or desire to respond truthfully. Since it may be relevant to the discussion, I am also extremely skeptical of Psychiatry, as it too is somewhat at the mercy of truth. Full disclosure: This is a mod-approved throwaway post for the following reason directly from the original approval message; as such, I'm happy to answer any personal questions relevant to my view: &gt;The reason I believe this to be the best course of action is that there are people close to me with various Psychology degrees, one of whom has very recently earned their bachelors degree... and I'd like to be able to see things as they do; I already know full well by now that I can't have that discussion with any them without leaving them feeling completely insulted by me. As my primary account is not a secret among them, I'd rather ask with some degree of anonymity. **View Update:** I do now understand that my view shouldn't be that Psychology is a non-science, but I do still hold the view that Behavioral Psychology and Psychotherapy, specifically client-therapist interactions, are rubbish. Despite that, I do strongly feel that my horizons have been expanded greatly as pertaining to Psychology in general.	0
I can tell you. In my town, Mallbork, there is a group of 20 or 10 Turks, who of course own a Kebab [place]. On the one hand, they are perceived to cope better in Mallbork than native inhabitants but unfortunately they are also perceived otherwise: as those who take money and income from Poles.	1
American universities spend too much money on their football teams. CMV I saw [this post]( on /r/CFB the other day showing an infographic ([seen here]( about how much American Universities spend to outfit their football teams. Apparently, schools like Auburn University and Ohio State University spend more than $35 million every year to outfit their football teams. The median spending per year on football equipment is $742,000 for NCAA Division 1 schools. I feel like this is an exorbitant amount to spend on a sport, and does not align with the true purpose of a university. Many of these same universities are currently raising tuition on college students, pricing more people out of an education and increasing the debt burden that college students take on. Sure, a private university can go ahead and spend but they want on whatever, but when state universities do so I have a real problem with that. Now, let me clarify that I'm not against sports in college, I just think that universities put too much money into the system. After all, most of that money ends up benefitting athletic outfitters like Nike. And I'm aware that many of these programs are in fact profitable, I just think that those profits should be put back into educational programs, and not into buying more fancy sports equipment. CMV.	1
What can I say? I agree with them Petra, at least in part, because we can't look at people as invaders coming into our countries to steal and kill or I don't know what. It is certain that if there are immigrants in our country, during a certain period of time, they do not steal, they work and if that is someone who behaves properly, who respects this country, who therefore contributes to our growth, then that is not a threat to this country. Then why shouldn't that person get an extension of his visa - I don't see any problem there, if the person works properly, behaves properly, surely there is no reason to deny him the visa.	0
When I said control - control at the point of entry, as the document also says. There you have a visa, a tourist visa and then they stay longer, whether we like it or not, but in that case, the US is already a model. They do it very well. There are many things we don't like about the U.S., but there, with immigration policy, they are very smart. And as I just mentioned, as an example, that in France and the United Kingdom, there are many Spanish doctors and nurses, because they are very qualified. In France, they have to take a French exam after six months. If they don't pass it, they have to go back to Spain.	1
The burden of proof should be on the creditor. If you make the debtor responsible for following up with a request, it gives the creditor an opportunity to say they never received anything from the debtor... If they had to send the documents to start with, there would not be any question.  	0
I received a bill from an attorneys office regarding a bill I did not think that was mine. I sent a certified return receipt request for validation but never received a response. So I sent a 2nd certified return receipt - request for validation and again never received a response. The attorneys office filed a civil suit and took me to court. I explained this to the judge and gave proof. The proof I submitted into the court file were copies of request of validation, the USPS certified letter statement's and request verification receipt statement's. This was all ignored by the judge because I was pro se and did not know Washington state law. I had made the request prior to this case being filed. Later it was explained to me by an attorney that the local county civil courts do not enforce federal laws, only state laws and in state court a request for validation is not recognized. I also requested proof of licensing which I did not receive because the plaintiff was and currently is not a licensed in Washington state as a debt collection agency - they are attorneys. The plaintiff won their case and I owed a debt that was not mine. I ask you, where is the fairness in this? What needs to occur is the laws need to be made clear for both the lay person and the judicial system.  	1
This is the problem. What account would stay open for 20 years after being delinquent. It seems to me this is just a way to prolong as long as possible the ability to harass people for very old debt. There needs to be time limits. This type of thing, re-filing debt, selling the same debt to someone else, and then adding it back AGAIN to the credit report is just an excuse to harass the heck out of people and do it legally. These are not good business practices. This is harassment. Once a debt is placed on a credit report -- or even sooner -- once the debt letter is sent, time should start running and this agency needs to set time limits that are reasonable. Creditors have a right to try to collect true, accurate debt. But what happens is the debt is wildly inflated, then it runs the gamut of various collection agencies until nobody even remembers its genesis. This is all to harass.  	0
You know, my only experience is with medical debts, but with those, we have NOT been notified several times, or sometimes, even one time. No one seems to care if the address is right and when you're dealing with an old person, the billing address is often not the same as the physical address); sometimes the bill seems to go to what they claim is a collection agency even before the insurance company finishes with it. We are perfectly happy to pay our bills, but our contract is with the provider, and that's who we pay, not a collection agency.  	1
Sorry, that was going very fast, I just wanted to add a few things to what Goulven was saying. I think that indeed, if we wait for the wrong quota, what quota, how do we calculate that; in any case, I think for the French, because me, I feel like that, it's that we've had to go through everything, all these mistakes, that we've had to go through, all this violence, that I also hear from you and [it's not worth it?] to start with what? it doesn't seem to me to be worth it to do the same thing of taking people as if they were Kleenex? We chartered boats to go and get... to empty Algerian villages, in the 50's, 60's, and then we threw them away and then, well, there, we would like to throw them away, we would like to take only those who suit us - what right do we have to take humans not for humans after all? We're talking about things here.	0
"I was just watching ""CBS This Morning"" and they mentioned that FICO is going to be partnering with more financial institutions to allow the financial institutions"" customers to get their FICO score for free. FICO is already offered for free with many financial institutions, but now FICO is aggressively expanding this offer through their ""Open Access"" program. __URL__ I have known about this ever since FICO put out a press release earlier this month. What I found out today on ""CBS This Morning"" is that Discover is going to allow their cardholders to see their FICO score for free on their monthly billing statement. I don't think this is appropriate for Discover or any other business to put a consumer""s FICO score on a billing statement or any other materials that can be turned over to debt collectors. Right now, debt collectors do not have access to any consumers FICO score. They do, however, have access to something called a ""collection score"" which is nothing at all related to FICO or a consumers creditworthiness. This action by Discover is a HUGE privacy concern and the CFPB should not allow creditors or anyone else to have access to a consumer""s FICO score."	1
I was going to say that we confuse legal immigrants and illegal immigrants. Because there are quotas for legal immigrants. That's where it can be useful. Certainly we can build, set up, develop a threshold there, or maybe I should say, that would be a kind of control that we could exercise. Whether those of the EU focus on developing that further, it is about legal immigrants. The illegal immigrants I mean, we have to ask ourselves where they come from and what can be done in that regard.	0
In my opinion, even if we manage to get all the unemployed people in the union to work, we won't prevent other populations from wanting to live better. I think that these two problems are not linked.	0
I lived in a country where all education was free. I was even getting paid a stipend while attending university. The quality of education was good, and the fact that it was free was a nice touch. Unfortunately there is no such thing as free lunch. Somebody still has to pay for it. The government that paid teachers' salaries took this money from my parents by paying them way less than free market would (most jobs were controlled by the government, so the government set salaries). The government also was notoriously inefficient, wasting money and resources. So I would rather pay for education directly rather than pay the government and let it pay for the education.	1
"I have a fairly common last name, and my listing in the phone book uses two initials rather than a first name. I get calls from credit collectors several times a week looking for various people with my last name and one or the other of my two initials. They are just taking a stab in the dark. When I tell them that I don't live with any other family members and that I have an excellent credit rating, they take me off of their list to of numbers for today's person of interest. When I ask them not to call me at all because I have no other people living with me that they would be looking for, they say that they only had me listed for their person of the day. Tomorrow my number might pop up as a possibility for tomorrow's person of the day, but they ""can't do anything about tomorrow."" I actually had a credit collection rep (in India) say that to me.  "	1
I'll pick up again what was said. So the problem is the language. But with us, it's not a problem in Spain. If the Maghrebians arrive, two months later they speak. Not perfectly, but they speak enough Spanish. They definitely understand everything and we can understand them. So the problem with us is not shaped like that. So it has nothing to do with the language. The Romanians, it's incredible how quickly they learned Spanish. Even before they came to the Union. I think necessity is the mother of invention, let's say. Because you have to learn there. But English people, for example, they don't learn a word of Spanish. So those who live with us, there are quite a few, Germans and English, and they don't make any effort. I have English neighbors. Very nice. We have established friendly ties. But not a word of Spanish. Not even after a long time. Especially the men are not very good. Apparently, the gentlemen of creation have even more difficulties with the language. Maybe the women have an easier access. Be that as it may, that is the situation. The English gentlemen in particular have made no effort at all to speak just one word of Spanish. Well, now, in order to integrate somehow, you have to manage to communicate with people you live with. That's the only way to integrate. Now the illegal immigrants: it has been said that there are none. So, somehow nobody is illegal. That is a term that is not correct. We can't say that a human being is illegal. One can commit illegal acts. But for a human being or a human being to be illegal, where are we going?	1
yes then I would like to give an answer. An African who comes here, and first has to walk 15 kilometers to get water, just opens the tap here. And has a small cottage or a small apartment. So I would actually like to ask all Africans here who are in a bad situation. No? This is a great injustice. So I would like to call them all here, so they can at least get a decent apartment here.	0
How exactly do you live your life according to that belief? Remember that one of the core aspects of science is that it never considers itself to be definitively correct about something. It only tries to provide evidence as to what is most probable to be correct at the moment. The scientific foundation was laid by people who had the same thoughts as you. They just decided to live with it and try to find out as much as possible, in the hope that some day, we would all know more about what we are and why. Perhaps you should join that adventure? :)	0
Most landlines and cell phones have caller ID technology ; if the number comes up showing a toll-free number or an unknown caller, many consumers will let such calls go to voice mail. Voice mail messages need to be discreet. No one needs their kids hearing messages from debt collectors. Anyone returning a call regarding a voice mail message should be informed by a live customer service rep of the mini Miranda warning. This should be done only after the person returning the call to the collector verifies his or her identity as the debtor.  	0
There was another debt collector that went after me a second time. First they placed me on their hit list trying to get me to pay the debt of a man with my last name and first initial. I told them that they were contacting the wrong person. Then, several months later, they went after me again, this time looking for a woman with my last name and first initial. After the second round, I send them a cease-communication letter, and they haven't called me again.  	1
I know when I was young, I was at a time when there were the first young people, the children of immigrants, who shared the school with me. There were no difficulties in being friends with each other, and I have daughters today, and - one of 26, one of 17 - and the one of 17, I see that the group of young people, I am in a city where there is all representation of origin. But the young people were not mixing anymore. But not at all. And it is still questioning. Because I know that in our family we are not at all xenophobic. We have friends of all origins. But young people don't mix anymore. They make choices among themselves, not to mix anymore. And that I find questioning. I don't have any judgement about that, but it's still a feature of society that can seem worrying, especially with all that we hear in the news, but the aggressions between young people, between ethnic groups, that are... it's the rise of communitarianism that generates an intolerance today that didn't necessarily exist before.	1
I understand the context of the Romanian colleague. I understand completely what Florin [FLO] just said and I would like to say to my colleague from Portugal [JOR] who spoke before. So maybe he did not understand me well. I think that the policy should be defined by the EU. So I totally agree with him. But I understand that the two criteria, which apparently are the most important, that is, each country has to apply its rules to its reality. So health and safety must be implemented and applied by the own countries, each country, there, must have sovereignty. And if the country thinks that there are other criteria, well, it will apply its own criteria. So on the basis of each reality in each country. And I disagree a bit with Magda [MAG]. She makes the mention here to the friends from the east. But immigration for us is not only from the East. Immigration comes from everywhere. It comes from Africa, in particular. In Portugal, we have Africans, Brazilians, and some people from the Balkans, for example. We also had some, for a while, Chinese. So health and safety, be it, opened up. I remind you that the Influenza A, this influx of Influenza A. How do we control the states? First we have to define the rules, we have the Schengen area, I don't know if you know well what the Schengen state means. When there is a health problem, all the borders will close in the Schengen area. So, it's very good, I think we have to create single market habits, but in reality and in the very near future, we will not be a free movement of people area, no. It's a wish, but in reality it doesn't happen like that. Because we must obviously take into account the fatalities. Finally, the criteria of health and safety, because terrorism is another problem. So I remind you that in the case of immigration we must remember that ... what criteria; are we going to say yes to the Europeans? Are we going to say no to the Brazilians, to the Africans? Do we create quotas? What do we do? We, in Portugal, have the sea, it is our border with Africa and Brazil. It is the Atlantic sea. And in the frame, Adrien obviously mentioned some European countries, which are east of Romania. This is my opinion, honestly. [1 :	0
"I definitely agree it would be wrong to push the more personal morals you seem to be talking about on someone through force or social pressure, but surely I should be allowed to push my morals through argument?

All right, I'm just going to speak up one more time and then no more. But there have now been statements where one feels obliged to go into it again. I think there is one country that has allowed immigration for many years, namely Germany, and some immigrants have also returned to their home countries. But there continues to be a problem with immigration now. And then there is one country where it never had immigration and now there is very very much, almost too much: that is Spain. That's also clear. Immigration has to be seen in context. And that's why I've spoken out several times. So I think immigration has always been selective. For example, you need language skills, but in a poor country, as I said, who can learn foreign languages? Of course, all doors and gates are open to him, yes? Those who are, of course, very highly qualified, scientifically trained, working in research and development; who has all these opportunities? These are primarily the highly developed industrialized countries. So, as I said, we have to fix these problems, otherwise we won't be able to get a grip on immigration either, that's where the causes lie. If we continue on the path we have taken so far, we will fail in Europe, even with the European model. Together, we must try to bring about harmonization. We must try to harmonize the individual rules that exist in the various member states. This is the path we must take. And we must combine this with aid to improve the living conditions in these countries, in the immigrants' countries of origin. Otherwise they will continue to come. There is also no question of legality. I can't say to someone who is starving, you don't have the right to come, right? We cannot then, as I said, somehow try to plug the channels, try to curtail immigration, to prevent it. As I said, to sort of push the stopper on the bottle or on the pipe. It's going to pop off with force at some point, right? That cork, that stopper. As I said, I think we also have a lot of skilled workers in Europe, but it is always said, yes skilled workers, especially skilled ones, can still immigrate. But Europe is still a whole. So I have freedom of movement now, I can go to any region in Europe now. I am no longer considered an immigrant. And then there was also a speech where it was said that we also have to help Europe with the issue of immigration. But Europe is all of us, right? We all belong to it. So we have to ask ourselves for help, I would say, yes? To solve this problem. So we can't say Europe has to help here, or we have to help. So that's all of us. We also need a certain openness, also in the sense of equality, equal treatment. I don't know whether we can bring about such changes, even in the European Parliament, whether they can solve the problem. In any case, we have to find a solution.	0
1010 In Holland, we have employees who employ workers illegally. It was said in the Dutch newspapers that some sanctions will be imposed upon those employees and that they will be punished. Of course there are also immigrants who have to survive and in order to that, they need to work, even under very hard conditions. I would like to know your opinion on this matter.  	1
What Nancy H said exemplifies the problem: no standards across the board. What happens to you in this situation depends on the collection agency, the creditor (in the first place) and where you live. Where you live should not be a factor.  	0

... I had the pleasure of being accepted in France to complete my education. I worked in France for two years and it was very good for me. Why not offer others, even if they are not from the EC, this opportunity to come to us to learn something from us, and vice versa, we can learn something from them as well. But we have been talking a bit more intensively about illegal immigrants, which is a completely different topic again, Holger.	1
I think exactly the opposite. That is to say, I don't see why it would be a problem for the European Union if we can solve it in our own countries or if we have to solve it in our own countries. Since we are talking about illegal immigration from outside the European Union, for me this is a problem of the European Union and not a national problem, so I want to believe that we will have to make nuances according to the countries because the problem is not the same if we have a border from outside the European Union or not, as it is the case for you, of course, but it is the case for France too. But for me, it's a problem that we must solve together.	0
I think the academic elitist views of engineering and other STEM fields in undergrad are justified. Please CMV **Edit 3: ** Thanks everyone! I have had my view changed mostly due to these arguments: (1) that grading is different between STEM and non-STEM with maybe a bit more leniency outside the hard sciences (2) My school is far from representative of everywhere despite being a large mid-tier institution and (3) Philosophy is hard when you dig deep enough. I honestly would like someone to change my view in regard to this because I totally believe that the academic elitist view of many engineers (myself included) is justified based on the difficulty of my classes. I haven't heard much of the same from other STEM majors but I think at this point it's a justified view for them as well. Basically, my view boils down to this: After having taken a number of upper-level social science courses as required non-tech electives (some economics, psychology, philosophy), it is my opinion that non-STEM majors (excluding skill-based arts/music) are much easier and in general require less work to get the same grade. If I were to decide to major in a non-STEM major I think I could be just as if not more successful than nearly everyone in these majors if I wanted to pursue one of them instead. I do not think the same can be said of a non-STEM major switching into engineering. They may be able to make it through the introductory courses but upper level undergraduate sequences of classes like heat and mass balances --&gt; fluid transport --&gt; heat and mass transfer I think would prove nearly impossible for the majority. **Thus, I think I am better than my fellow non-STEM majors academically because I believe I can do everything they can do in addition to being able to do something that they are unable to do.** To me, this is a *very negative* view to possess because I devalue the effort other students. If you can change my view, I would very much appreciate it. I will do my best to reply to all reasonable challenges. Please feel free to ask me for any clarification. Edit: I do not believe that I am more intelligent or that STEM majors are inherently more intelligent that people in other fields. Many of you have made my conscious of the fact that what I believe stems more from the fact that the mid-level university I attend does not seem to have as strict of requirements for non-STEM majors in regard to coursework as it does for STEM majors. I'm certain there are programs out there with excellent non-STEM programs that I would be in way over my head at. I'm going to read this all later when I have a bit more time but I think there a couple people at least that I may want to give deltas to. Thanks everyone. Edit 2: Ok, sorry for the delay! Reading over everything now after having previewed it on my phone.	1
"I believe that canned techniques for self-defense won't really help someone in a real life situation. CMV. I was just watching some self-defense videos on YouTube which showed some standard techniques. For example, [here]( is one such video that explains how to escape the mount. When I see these videos, I just can't help but feel that everything they show is rehearsed and that it wouldn't work in a real life situation. [Here's]( another video I saw. In the video, the ""victim"" is on the ground and the ""attacker"" is standing. The instructor explains what a person should do in such a situation: keep your knees up, track the attacker, and kick. But if you notice, at 1:42, when the attacker goes around, it's just so rehearsed and slow! In a real situation, someone on the ground would not be able to turn as fast as a person can run on their feet. And once the attacker is close to the victim's head, he can kick/stomp. Also, the video *assumes* that the attacker will want to get close to the victim's head, but that might not always be the case. The attacker could just stay in one place and kick the victim back. And if the attacker is standing, his kicks will have a lot more power than the victim's, who is on the ground. CMV"	1
"I think classes for ""gifted"" kids (like GATE) meant to provide extra enrichment should instead be offered to struggling students who would benefit more from them. CMV My middle school had GATE, Gifted And Talented Education, to provide ""gifted"" kids with extra enrichment so that they could reach their ""full potential"". The students in the gifted classes often got more attention from teachers than other students, even if those ""regular"" students were just as smart as - if not smarter than - the ""gifted"" ones. I think that, if the kids are really ""gifted"", they shouldn't need extra help, and those ""enrichment"" classes should be given to struggling students who would benefit more from the extra work and attention. I also think that stratifying students in this way causes unnecessary self-esteem issues to students who are deemed ""not smart enough"" for the gifted classes. Therefore, I believe that such classes should be offered for struggling students instead, or not offered at all."	1
Well, we have said a lot now. Now I have to structure all this. So, Claire [CLC], what she has just said about peace is very, very good, I totally agree. Peace is certainly also a point of attraction. We have peace between the different peoples in Europe who coexist, who coexist very well, wonderful. But let's take a house with twenty bells and whistles and with only one German name in Germany, for example, and the others have an Islamic sounding name, I say quite clearly, Turks. I don't think this is very good for cultural peace, social peace and working peace. Of course, it is very good: We live in a peaceful world etc., we are all Christians, we love each other, we love our neighbors all over the world, especially the planet, I don't need soldiers anymore ? - that's very very good, but if you certainly have five people, asylum seekers living in your villa, right? So I think that's very good. And I think that all those who think that we should promote immigration because we all live in peace, I would like to ask them to make their house available. I will come to your house too, I will drink, I will eat, I will enjoy social security and then you will pay me a training - very good. So, please, give me your address and I thank you. [1 :	0
I have found, on numerous occasions, that the debt collection process allowing firms purchasing debt - for pennies on the dollar - often use intimidating tactics that can easily be considered extortion. Every time a deb t collector purchases an old, out-of-date debt, they re-file the debt with the credit bureau(s). This continues the credit report damage for years - sometimes decades. As a mortgage banker, those persons often find it impossible to secure a mortgage and realize the American dream of home ownership.  	0
Many states currently have laws that make it illegal to engage in debt collection without being licensed to do so in the state. However, this does not stop debt collectors from violating these state laws and threatening to sue individuals, even though they legally cannot because they are unlicensed in the state. This is unlawful and menacing behavior. It would be easier to bring claims under the FDCPA if the act were more clear that threats to sue when a debt collector is unlicensed to collect on a debt in a state is a false, deceptive, or misleading representation. This clarity combined with stronger penalties might serve to better dissuade debt collectors from continuing to violate the law in attempts to collect on debts in state where they have no right to.  	0
"I sometimes ""hire"" undergraduate volunteers for internships at a research laboratory. The advice I got from professors when I started to do this was to set a reasonably high minimum GPA (e.g., 3.3) and not even consider anyone who fell below it. After breaking that rule a few times and getting burned, I've come to see the wisdom of it. Here's my understanding now: * GPA is ***not*** a valid measure of how enthusiastic or capable someone is. * GPA ***is*** a valid measurement of how reliable someone is. When I'm scheduling brainwave recording sessions, I need to know with absolute certainty that the person I hired to help me collect data is not going to sleep through their alarm, miss their bus for the second time this week, lose their grandmother for the third time this year, drop out of contact all weekend because they're getting drunk, etc. A high GPA tells me that someone is willing to prioritize the work that they promised to do, even when it gets boring or they don't feel like it or it interferes with their social plans. I can see why real employers might care about that as well."	1
Why should the consumer pay a filing fee at all if the collector is at fault? That could be a hardship on many people. The collection agencies need to follow the rules of doing their validation correctly, and this would not be an issue.  	0
Before a few years we might have to build them companies to give them the basis of life there but don't think they want it. For example if we build them businesses and finally they can't sell their products here at the prices they are interested in, then it will be nothing, so at that time they would have no base or basis for living. So the conditions there are very dependent on the policy that we have here.	0
Yes I am the same opinion as the Torsten, so if then I find the EU should establish uniform rules. For all countries. So I think it can also not only be that they somehow give people work permits. So that people with better education or so can immigrate rather than those who just ... Yes, I mean they are looking for skilled workers and then they tell other people who should not immigrate. I think that's unfair. So what is actually legal and illegal? So now only from the EU countries. The rules are not quite clear to me. So which people are really allowed to come in? When do they get a work permit and which ones don't? I just don't know them all.	0
"I have seen the ""moderator"" in the caller ID forum ask if it would be okay to put the company's name on the caller ID because this could show to others around that the person has a debt and would then compromise the consumer's privacy and security. Yet, there is a discussion to allow these calls at a consumer's work? many people do not work in an office, so a message would have to be left with a secretary. This is letting someone else know of a debt who should not be privy to that information. The ONLY reason these companies have to calling someone at work is to publicly shame the person into paying. It is the modern version of putting someone in stockades and throwing fruit at them, or a modern scarlet letter. If there is another phone number on an application, that is the one that needs to be used. If there is an address on the application, that is what needs to be used. Calls to someone's work are off limits PERIOD! There is not way for the collection agency or the government regulation body to GUARANTEE that no one besides the consumer gets the information when someone's work is called.  "	1
"I actually agree with you largely. However, a lot of the problem lies on the band itself. As a guitarist, I never would have believed it. But I absolutely did once I shifted into live sound. 1) Drums are fucking loud. Ever hear a drummer tear into a snare? Ever hear one smash his cymbals? In some small club shows, there's almost no need for a mic (except for the thump of a kick, and a little added sound just so nothing gets lost). 2) Often, especially with rock bands, the guitarists feel the need to have guitar amps WAY overpowered for the space they're playing in. Nobody actually *needs* a 100 watt, 8x12 guitar amp and cabinets. 30 watts and a 10"" speaker are more than enough once you have a mic on it. But so many bands crank up their amps to the point where what you're hearing in the audience doesn't have anything to do with the sound guy and everything to do with ""but I NEED to have my amp turned up!"" 3) Way too much bass is a bad thing, yes, but at the same time please remember, your hearing probably isn't going to be damaged from bass that's too loud. It takes a hell of a lot more low-frequency power to do any remote sort of damage to your hearing than you will ever notice in a lifetime. 4) PRO sound guys (not just the tech at your local night club) aren't dulled from years of loud gigs. We actually carry custom-moulded earplugs designed to reduce SPL without changing the sounds we're hearing (too much). What you have to understand there is that MOST concert-goers only see an occasional show. The loud volumes won't do much damage if it only happens once or twice a year. Touring engineers are exposed to it every single day, often over 100 nights a year, plus soundcheck, rehearsals... I'd absolutely recommend earplugs for any frequent concert goer. But it's not going to affect 75%+ (depending on genre) of the audience to see one show that's a bit too loud. That is, assuming this last factor is not in play... 5) A lot of times, it's a crapshoot as to what a venue has when it comes to sound. I tour with a national act, and I call venues before every single show, often two or three times, to make sure what they have will be good enough. Half the time, what I walk into is nothing like what they said on the phone. Or they have the whole rig set up wrong so it's not actually working at its full potential, or it's far too powerful for its own good. The problem gets even worse if the band doesn't have their own engineer; then it's entirely up to a house tech who is usually inexperienced or has already blown their ears out, or both. A band that carries its own sound system is going to be much better, but they're also going to only play larger venues like arenas, and they'll have time to fine-tune the system to work perfectly for the room."	0
"Bonzarel. while I think your idea is a good one, it could open the floodgates to interest rate padding the debt until it reaches one of the ""floors"" that you are suggesting. 30% interest rate charges, penalties and fees (which in turn also get hit with a 30% interest rate charge), can accelerate even a 500 dollar debt into the thousands in less than 24 months time.

"It is the responsibility of the creditor and debt collectors to report accurate information. Reporting accurate information has nothing to do with ""debt collectors who don't report to credit reporting agencies at all."" If a debt collector reported accurately that the debt in question has not been paid, but now is, it is the responsibility of that debt collector to report the newly accurate information. As I too have noticed, some debt collectors will not accurately report updated information to the credit bureaus once they are paid.  "	0
Of course, the employer could choose any criteria but I myself experience this problem, for example, in my professional sector. There are many Poles, not only the Poles and others, especially from Eastern Europe, who are working in our industry and I think that the language barrier is very important here. I think that it is critical when you cannot communicate with each other adequately if we do not have the basics. Then we are missing the basics. I think that government should require either the EU, but still rare because, as someone arrives he comes to the country and then the country to which that person arrives should require him to speak the language, or to get to know the language slightly, at least to a level that he is able to communicate. Then the employer can choose any type of criteria - for instance what kind of employees he really need - to mention this is here are some items that would be allocated to each are two groups of criteria. 	1

Here's wikipedia's definition of rape: &gt;Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse, which is initiated by one or more persons against another person without that person's consent. &gt;The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or with a person who is incapable of valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, or below the legal age of consent So, for instance, if a woman broke into a man's house with a gun, held it on him and made him have sex with her while under the threat of being shot, that would be coercing him into sex with her, which would be rape. Erections are also involuntary. For instance, a person who is unconscious can still get hard. Men who have broken their backs and cannot move their lower bodies are still capable of sexual stimulation and having sex. A woman who drugs a man and then has sex with him while he's passed out is raping him, and is having non-consensual vaginal sex. Those are two examples. There's also the example of [A russian hairdresser who knocked out, tied up, force fed viagra to, and repeatedly raped a man who broke into her store.](	0
Debt Collection companies get a very unfair debt negotiation advantage against an alleged defaulter when they hire an unscrupulous service company that has lied about giving a proper service or subservice to the alleged debtor's residence. Judges do not seem to understand that if a service company will fraudulently state in court documents that they served a defaulter or subserved someone at the residence when in fact they did not, that the debt collector can become very arrogant and cocky as to how they negotiate with the alleged defaulter. In a nutshell, if the debt collector's one sided terms are not met, they will simply hire the service company who will provide service even if it is a false service. Judges rationalize that the mail service is an adequate notification without realizing that what a false service does is embolden the debt collection company to not properly negotiate a debt with an alleged defaulter because they have total control over the service aspect, even if fraudulently obtained. This need to be fixed and false servers need to be fined along with the debt collection companies who hire them and keep hiring them even after they receive complaints of false service.  	0
So I continue. I think that each member state must have its own autonomy to define the criteria and the conditions do not exist to be able to control the problematic situation for example. I see it more on the side of the problems. And I think that the best way is that each state has its own autonomy and the management is done according to the most criteria. So, the debate has been launched, so we're going to debate this point. [1 :	0
The CFPB doesn't need to craft rules to encourage non-litigation alternatives or not to sell to those who utilize litigation models. BillBartmann's data is suspect as to 10M lawsuits filed yearly and likely his models comparing litigation and non litigation data has not been published. The facts are consumers need to reach out and communicate to a lender, agency, or debt buyer rather than not communicating at all. Debts not repaid usually result in the debt being charged off so the consumer had a minimum of 180 days to seek alternative repayment options. Lenders, collection agencies and debt buyers have a right to sue a legal debt just like the IRS. Keep in mind that judgments last longer than open credit accounts looking at statute of limitations. To BillBatram's comment that filing bankruptcy creates hell as far as FICO scores, consumers face that issue with non payment of debt and bankruptcy is an alternative for a consumer to have a fresh start. That was the intent of the bankruptcy law and still is. Consumers with little or no hope to repay debts care more about moving forward with their lives instead of worrying about FICO SCORES.  	0
"The current setup is a second-best solution. Best: Society provides resources to all kids who need them Second-best: Society uses some stop-gap measure to get resources to kids who need them. Worst: Kids don't get needed resources. You're right that, in a reasonable world, we wouldn't use child-support laws to get resources to children. Those laws have all kinds of flaws, from problems of consent, to the absurd idea that a child's right to support depends on the wealth of its parents. But, the problem with the ""Remove Child Support"" position is that it's taking steps in the wrong order. If we take away the stop-gap measure, we move into the worst-case. No one wants starving kids. And the unfairness of ""Random Kid Starves"" is worse than the unfairness of ""random person loses X% of their income."" Instead, I think your position should be, ""As a society we don't want kids to starve. So, we should start replacing the child-support system with a society-based system. That way, only people who want to be a kids guardian will be the guardians."""	0
I think that what Edelgard just said is of eminent importance, because education - because language - is the way to education and education is the way to prosperity.

"I don't necessarily disagree with you, as I believe everyone should be respected, but here is the argument I think makes the most sense with regards to why it may be ok (in the minds of many) to respect homophobes less than other people: Homophobes are not respectful of everyone. Since homophobes are not respectful of everyone simply for being human, many people consider them fair game to disrespect. Esseintially they forfeit their right to be respected by disrespecting others. I think this argument is a little hypocritical, at least how I phrased it, but it isn't entirely irrational. I am an American, and we tend to value freedom, but you quite simply can't have every freedom out there. You cannot allow all people to be free to have jobs and live where they like while also allowing perfect freedom to discriminate on the part of employers and landlords. Therefore the United States has been (slowly) siding more and more with limiting the freedoms that limit other freedoms. This is not the exact same thing but it is similar. Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't. The part that doesn't convince me is that it assumes that respect is some limited thing that cannot be given out to everyone (as opposed to freedom which clearly can't), whereas I believe that it is possible to respect people who have radically different beliefs than I do. That being said, I do not respect all people equally. I have a fair amount of respect for everyone, but there are definitely some people who I respect more than others and some I hold in slightly lower regard. This is often a factor of a nubmer of things about a person. I value traits like kindness, loyalty, leadership, a good work ethic, creativity, intelligence, and open-mindedness, to name a few. When someone is pretty bad at some of these things I tend to respect them a little less than someone who displays them quite well. Homophobes are terribly closed-minded. I honestly find it impossible to respect a homophobe as much as another person who is equally respectable in every other way. It is definitely a knock against them. I try my best not to belittle them and to treat them with human decency (hold the door open, smile and be polite, be friendly, etc.), but only because I do that to everyone. I do not respect them enough to take most of their opinions seriously, at least on the topic of society and laws. With regards to the ""witch-hunt"" I am actually not very bothered by it. I strongly believe that gay people should have equal rights, and a large and growing number of people agree with me. There are still many people who don't but it is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to be open about it, which I see as a good thing. The message being sent is that it is not ok to be homophobic. Maybe it is not being sent in the nicest of ways as it tells homophobes that their beliefs are not ok (which is always hard to hear and tends to make people defensive as you noted) but it is an important message to send and I would rather it happen poorly than not at all."	1
Yes, I actually wanted to add that if these things should become reality, but also the population - I say - must be informed. It must also constantly the state of the visions that the EU has or which then go as a directive to the countries, so that this can also really be carried further, so that the people at the base understand below: What is actually to become of it? So that they can then support it and possibly be in favor of it, yes.	0
We know that the topic is really full of emotions and also affects. I want to ask beforehand a factual question to dear Hans, Hans Buur: The European Commission has not executed any legislation in this way, to my knowledge. The factual situation is, these immigration/immigration policies, including asylum policies are 90 percent national, in the core area of national policy. And, of course, we cannot expect our national politicians to implement now what is in the brochure. On the other hand, I know that there is a fire in some countries; Strait of Gibraltar, Malta, Albania, Adriatic Sea. These are the hot spots for the southern European countries, which certainly want pan-European relief there. So this is the first time I've heard that the problem has already spread to Denmark by boat refugees. But I don't think it's particularly dramatic in Denmark. In the Eastern European countries, it is clear that we have relatively little illegal immigration. Logically, because the employees from these Eastern European EU members, which were admitted in 2004, want to go to the West, especially to Great Britain, but also to Germany, where the conditions are the most liberal. So the Poles have other problems than immigrants. Schengen agreement, Ukraine border are the problems. I believe, as a predominantly European-oriented person, that the politicians must not make this problem, asylum law then above all, a marshalling yard, will have to make a certain unification. This is a laborious business because, of course, it is always the populists, the right-wing populists, who immediately set the mood in Europe. This is what we are experiencing now, or even to an extreme, that an Irish millionaire with 30 million from the U.S. decisively dominated the Irish election campaign, so that the Irish were the main beneficiaries, may I say, of the EU. For many years with the highest gross national product growth, tax haven by the way, and had laid this bad egg in the nest, namely to agree by referendum to this meager narrow-gauge constitution, namely Lisbon Protocol. So the issue is very very sensitive as far as immigration is concerned. The European politicians were addressed. I believe that they know much more about some things, of course under the influence of the associations and the lobbies. There's no point in ranting anonymously about politician XY without knowing exactly what's going on. We will then listen to them, and then I am also prepared to ask critical questions.	1
Legal immigration is legal immigration. It means: I am leaving my country, I am getting a new job in another country and I am earning money. It seems to me that we are too sentimental over the legal immigrants. If we can afford to keep our own citizens why do we keep illegal immigrants? It is clear that we can not afford for this matter. That’s life. We should not be too sensitive. If we cannot deliver a health system to our citizens why should I care about the illegal immigrants? We are in a bad situation and we still have to help those that do badly. Maybe it is not a Christian but a moral behaviour. Thank you.	0
"Again basic things: The EU comes up in Germany only then, half a year before the election - otherwise in wide things hardly. And for all those who - I don't want to get into the ""Bild"" newspaper now - I just read an article in the ""Stern"" today, there a teacher of a secondary school reports diary-like about what happens to him there, that's interesting reading - there are very many names that come up that could not be of German origin, although even the names are international today. But it's interesting to read - harrowing to read what's happening. Thank you."	1
"For attorney debt collectors, being required to provide a list of all the rights the consumer may have comes perilously close to the provision of legal advice; even if it doesn't cross that line, the unsophisticated debtor may believe that an attorney is acting as a neutral court officer rather than as an advocate for an adverse party. I've had debtors ask me ""Do I need to come to court for this?"" after I've sued them.  "	1
On the change actually, the demographic change by the way which are where. Well, it's actually a population incision in Europe, especially in fact a shift towards an older population and less young population. Conversely, in Africa, it is more of a young population or a demographic explosion. In fact, someone from... pragmatically we can think that naturally a transfer of [...] between these two geographical scenes to keep a balance. And clearly, in fact, we can signal the future [...] in Europe. And this need will be felt. I think it will depend on the countries and this is the point in particular of a fashion of how the withdrawals are managed in the different countries. I think that a country like France, where there is a pay-as-you-go system - in fact a transfer from the working population to the retired population - an object is to keep a strong working population to support the retired population, so it's a limit for new workers in countries where a pension that [...] is based on capitalization. This poses a problem. Then there was the simple question of the evolution of economic growth, which is a problem that concerns all countries generally. There is no way to ensure economic growth. We need workers and it is clear that if the European population ages, we will have to find workers elsewhere. So there you have it. Now, demographic protections also vary from country to country. In France, the birth rate is still rising and so it is clear that in countries, especially Germany, this problem would be particularly prevalent and serious.	1
I think that the Schengen agreements must be applied. We have to apply them. And also improve them. But it is absolutely necessary that this population that orders itself from us, 27 countries, can understand that we cannot accept all the misery of the world. It is terrible, but that is how it is. Otherwise Europe cannot help anymore. We can circulate in the 27 countries and we can have immigrants who come from these 27 countries. But if we go out there, we will have big problems with Turkey. Because if Turkey joins the EU, all the people who are around Turkey will enter through Turkey to enter through the other countries. And this is a difficult problem. I know that all the governments are working on this now. We have an immigration mini that is not helping. The... it is effective because within our countries now there are associations that depend on these immigrants. For example when you want to send back 20 or 30 Africans because they sell drugs, you can't. These associations get around. You will have sent one back when he has two thousand. And that will be a problem. I have in.	1
No, it is not even clear who a debt collector is, particularly under CA law. The person sending the validating notice is typically a debt collector. This just causes confusion.  	0

Or should we rather (...) so that the ones that could make the debates like religion, religious practices. I take an example; for example magic tricks and things like that, they are very very local. In this framework it would be better not to address them, in fact, when you come to a territory. Do you think that people should conform exactly to the country they come from, or should the country they come from and the people who migrate there find a common ground that would be much smoother and that would necessarily make the differences disappear?

I disagree with the above assessment. As an alleged defaulter I have asked over and over and over again to have the debt set where it was at the time of alleged default and that no more penalties fees or interest rate charges be tacked on, and that I will commit to a monthly autopay. People who INVOLUNTARILY defaulted because of a life changing event in their lives (such as becoming caregivers for their parents) may want to consider all of their defaults together, so if five defaults occurred, the alleged defaulter has to divide whatever money they may be able to apportion every month, by five. Debt collectors refuse to see this as a reasonable solution and only acknowledge their own debt with the alleged defaulter, making it impossible for the alleged defaulter to do the right thing and begin paying back everybody.  	1
I would like to say that Muslims are people and people are different. I have been living for one year in Köln, I was studying, and there are plenty of Muslims. In fact, some of them assimilate themselves and were normally taking part in classes, they were also my neighbours, but there was something that scared me a lot in their culture. For example, at the beach we could see a man without any clothes and his wife fully dressed up, sweaty and she couldn’t show her face. Other example, I had a friend which was saying that she would never marry a guy which is not Turkish. She has been living there for 20 years and could never change her mind because this is exactly what her parents want to. The thing that scares me most is the women’s role in their culture. The fact that they do not have any rights, that they can not show their faces. It is not about the religion because this is completely neutral for me, in what somebody believe in. However, some elements of their culture are contradictory to democracy in our European approach and sometimes I am scared of this.	1
Yeah, if I'm forced to. Actually, there's not much more to say about it, but if you want to visit different cultures, or if you want to do that, you should go to Duisburg, there are whole districts that are only inhabited by Turkish residents, who have no contact with the others at all, and a two-world society is created that can never be fruitful, and at some point it falls apart; even our Commissioner Schimanski can't help.	1
I would like to add something, if you allow me: Some time ago, an experiment was carried out in Poland, which became known, and it was suggested to an average Pole, with an average salary, to live on it for one month; he with his family, which consists of three people - result: He was downright shocked, because this sum, which was granted for the whole month, he spent it in three days. But a normal Pole, he has to live on it for a whole month. Of course, this is an anecdote, but it illustrates the real situation. You may be surprised or you may find it funny, but it is the pure fact, what I just said with the experience.	1
Debt collectors call and cannot verify that the creditor has merged with another company. The debt may have written off the books of the acquired company. I propose that the CFPB implement a rule pertaining to debts written off by an acquired company and any additional stipulations on a timeframe to which an old debt can be collected only if the consumer has been validly notified that the debt has been sold to a debt collection agency; excluding the initial call from the DCA  	0
From a creditor's standpoint, I generally agree with this comment. I think a good validation notice could answer a lot of the consumer's question. I think the author of the above note had some very well reasoned thoughts. I wouldn't go so far as to add that an itemized statement must be provided, particularly if one might not be available (perhaps because of record retention rules or because one simply may not exist), but providing information as to the type of account, brand name of the original creditor issuing the account, the account number, the date of last pay, and the name of the party from whom the debt may have been purchased would help. Providing documentation at the get go seems rather unneccessary and costly, particularly if the wording of the letter allows the consumer to readily identify the account, and the disclosures allow the consumer to request documentation for validation.  	0
So first of all, the answer to the question from just now, I still owe it. I see a very clear difference between my private sphere, my immediate private sphere, between my apartment - I move in several rooms, here in the question it also sounded a bit - so first of all I feel like a private person in my own rooms, I have a family environment, these are my neighbors. Then I move in a community, then - they may all laugh a bit now - we are a district Waldegg-Frankenberg, we are Waldegger. So that's still a little bit where we just say, that's us too. Then we are German next and then we are a country of the EU. So we have to look and I can't just say: This is my home, I'll close the borders, after me the deluge - it's not that simple, because if we turn the whole thing around: We are sitting here in Germany, we are the ones who drive cars, we are the ones who have warm houses, where power plants are located, where greenhouse gases go into the air. We just release that into our environment. But then we have to make the walls high enough, so that we leave our garbage and all our things with us. We can't say on one side, we want to live well, but for the people we close the doors and then say: Here is the border, thank you, get out.	0
I wanted to say something about the legal immigrants. I was listening to this this afternoon. We want to stick to principles, we are talking about foreigners. Certainly there should be some control, but there should also be quotas in terms of different countries. That's [the] view of Denmark in that respect, I should say.	0
Corruption, it's at the many levels. That is to say that - as I said earlier - there are elections that take place, someone is democratically elected and everything is rigged so that the other is elected because the other has - as Pierre said earlier - he has the people, the economic powers, the international firms. Because with them, the agreements between countries and countries, they are not interested, they always want - for example in the oil wells, I speak for example in my country there is all the gold and diamonds, I do not know if you watch often enough the TV, there is the Congo, Rwanda, there, the ore that is there, all the laptop of the world, it is the ore that is there. So they don't want that - the country is not an exporter of these minerals, it is another country opposite that is an exporter. To show you how the complicity of things is, they want, they put someone in their place and the companies there exploit practically for free with those who corrupt Africans to make wars, because with money you can do everything - maybe not in Europe, but in Africa with money you can do everything. So they play on that and that's why there is war all the time, so they can profit. They don't want there to be safe structures for it to work, that's it. There was [... I have a brother in the village who is - if I don't send him a shirt, he doesn't wear it - he's happier than I am, because when I see all this, it's unfortunate, as we said earlier in the questionnaires, I'm French but there's no one who would really like to leave their country to - even though I have cars here and all that, I would have preferred - and with that help by the way, I studied to help these little ones because I, until I was six years old, I didn't wear shoes and now then now, people wear shoes but I can't, it's even worse these days, that's the problem.	0
"This is the PROBLEM over and over Why should lawyers get a pass from rules of the Bar Associations or rules of the court because they are now considered ""debt collectors"" even I did not know this, though I have seen advertised quite a bit lawyers in the ""collection"" business. This is wrong. I hope if anything, this very thing is addressed. Using a lawyer to send a letter is often a way to intimidate. People become too frightened to even respond. The rules are blown off by lawyers who go into this debt collection business because they make a fast easy buck, and they know the debtor has very little recourse, and there is so few rules that protect the consumer/debtor. Being in debt stopped being a crime decades ago, but the lack of rules that protect the debtor are bringing back these draconian practices. Uniformity, is needed, and making lawyers abide by the rules of the Bar. It is bringing to light why this system has become so fraught with abuse.  "	0
"I think it's fair to say there are genuine conspiracies in the world. Powerful people do in fact conspire to gain power and money. But the difference between ""most"" conspiracy theories and legitimate ones (Watergate, etc.) is standard of evidence. Most conspiracy theorists come up with their theories in a self-sealing way, such that they cannot be disconfirmed. Any evidence they find contradicting the idea can be easily dismissed as propaganda by the conspirators or incorporated into their alternate reality narrative. [This article]( discusses a group of scientists who had the opportunity to study conspiracy theories forming in real time. You can see the flaws in reasoning and immunity to falsification conspiracy theories suffer from. I guess it's possible that through flawed reasoning and inconsistent standards of evidence that most conspiracy theorists have stumbled upon the truth merely by chance, but that seems implausible. The best way will always be to examine the actual facts with each theory. What do we find out when we consider all objections? The Moon Landing was not faked. Vaccines do not cause autism. Aliens didn't land at Roswell. Elvis is dead."	0
"I don't think that the partial SSN should be included. That raises too many privacy concerns. And I'm sure that one day a debt collection company will have a ""system malfunction"" and will ""accidentally"" send the full SSN. Too many consumers have similar names in the same city. Lastly, many different companies classify a partial SSN as the first 5 digits whereas other stick to the traditional last 4 digits. If a mail thief is lurking, then he might have access to a consumers full SSN.  "	0
I have one more suggestion, I come from Poland and I have noticed that in my country a greater development has been achieved, by investments of foreign investors, like for example near Wroclaw, a factory of LCD monitors had been opened. And I believe that this is a right direction to support the economies of other countries, to open there factories because it is obvious that in poorer countries the labour force is cheaper, right? Those countries produce goods with lower costs. And maybe some of you may have any other ideas to support the economies, and not only by opening factories in those countries? Thank you.   	1
"Larry S, your quote...""A plaintiff in a lawsuit cannot be placed in a situation where it is rewarding to sue with insufficient cause and minimal risk"" is a very powerful statement and one that I entirely agree with. It is this scenario that emboldens debt collectors to hire riff raff service companies who will lie about doing a legal service or sub service, and apparently get away with it. I have been victimized by two false subservices. I think both were done by the same service company.  "	1
Yes, I thought it was very interesting that some aspects have already been put forward: the job market, the legal/illegal aspect. And for integration, it depends. It depends of course on our own expectations, right, our expectations of these people. And the immigrants, if we want them to adapt to the culture of the host country or if we want to learn from others. So, it's a sign of respect, mutual respect, and I think that many of these problematic situations arise precisely because immigrants have not been given this respect. It is something that is often expected of immigrants to adapt completely and to keep quiet.	0
