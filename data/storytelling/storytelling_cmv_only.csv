I think that Obama hasn't made any good decisions since he took office. CMV I think that the president hasn't made any good decisions since he took office. I think he is the scum of America, downright Yelawolf style crook. If you can give me examples of some good things that he has done, that would suffice, I mean it's good to have an open mind and I don't want to seem purposefully ignorant. I'm surrounded by people who share the same ideals as I do, if you get what I mean. Can you name like 5 things he did well in? I live in New Jersey and I am 17 years old, I wish to gain an unbiased and factual answer for this. Thank you.	1
"You may find this site to be interesting: Also, from 17 year old to 17 year old, do not get your information on politics from your parents or TV stations. As great a guy as my dad is, he spouts complete rubbish when talking about politics and in particular, Obama. Since I've been following politics pretty closely for a while now, I've usually heard about the news he is talking about and usually from his end there's some sort of important misconstrued detail that makes Obama look evil. The worst of it all, my younger brothers get the impression that Obama is bad because they hear my dad complain about him. And the same shit goes on in my school with other kids. Last year, we had a school vote just to see what way our school would swing in the election (it was Republican, by the way) and when talking to many of my friends, they often said ""I'm voting for Romney... because my parents don't like Obama."" When I say why I like Obama, people often don't put up much argument. I feel like people just sort of support what their family wants them to support. It's like they agree with one side but vote for the other because they don't know what they're doing. I hear people say how abortion is so bad because it's ""killing a person,"" when they don't realize at all how simplified and nonsensical it is to use that as your argument. Or hear people who aren't even that religious make fun of gays because they know they should. Or hear people shout about how teachers should be paid as much as pro athletes without realizing how economics work in the slightest. Or hear people shout how all guns need to be banned because guns kill people, blah blah. Us highschool kids are great at making BS pseudo-logical arguments all the time. If your highschool friends agree with you, I doubt it hardly means much. Now I'm not saying Obama is some sort of god who is not allowed to be critiqued, he has most certainly fucked up (in particular, this second term), and I'm not saying Romney is some sort of shitbag that only politically uneducated support. I'm just saying that, especially in highschool, you tend to start listening to and understanding what your parents are saying about politics. And when you hear it from your parents, people whom you tend to trust greatly, you might just assume that it's true rather than looking into it and forming your own opinion... because they're your parents and they must know what's right, right? I'm also not saying you're one of those impressionable people, maybe you're just more republican, I don't know. But I know for a fact highschool kids tend to be notorious for taking sides in politics and not knowing why - other than the fact that their parents or someone said so. Sorry, kinda got off on a tangent. Sometimes I just need to make it clear because I often don't trust people my age with holding a well-thought-out political conversation. Anyways, yeah, look at that site and it lists a bunch of good shit Obama has done. He's no saint, but he sure as hell ain't as bad as you might perceive."	1
"It's kind of hard to get an unbiased ""good"", as that term is subjective in itself, but I can certainly give you some things. 1. [Signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco for the first time]( 2. [Signed New START Treaty - nuclear arms reduction pact with Russia]( 3. [First president to endorse same-sex marriage equality]( (Although I admit this one is very politicized, so feel free to ignore it if you don't feel it is good to you personally). 4. [Signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination for women and other workers]( 5. [Reversed the policy of barring media coverage during the return of fallen soldiers to Dover Air Force Base]( 6. [Launched recovery.gov to track spending from the Recovery Act, providing transparency and allowing the public to report fraud, waste, or abuse]( 7. [Provided the Department of Veterans Affairs with more than $1.4 billion to improve services to America's Veterans]( 8. [Signed the Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act, which provides health care to 11 million kids -- 4 million of whom were previously uninsured]( 9. [Developed stimulus package, which includes approx. $18 billion for nondefense scientific research and development]( 10. [Signed the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act to stop fraud and wasteful spending in the defense procurement and contracting system]( 11. [Issued executive order to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay]( (Didn't work, but that's more Congress's fault, and he's still done more with it than any other President). 12. [Tax cuts for up to 3.5 million small businesses to help pay for employee health care coverage]( That's all I got for now. You may not think some of these are ""good"" for you personally, but I think the position that he's done absolutely nothing good is indefensible, considering all that he has done in office, the above being only a small sampling of it.

I don't believe that the military should have different fitness standards for men and women. CMV The US army [requires]( push-ups sit-ups 2-mile run men 40 50 16:36 women 17 50 23:06 What rational justification can there be for excluding a man from the military who can meet the female standards but not the male standards. If fitness requirements serve a functional military purpose, why should a man who can do only 20 push-ups in a minute be rejected while a woman at the same level would be adequately fit? If certain levels of fitness are required for the job, why should women get a handicap? Is the purpose of the fitness requirements to reward people who are relatively fit for their peer group or to serve functional goals?	0
"As we all know, military jobs often require no physical activity at all. If a particular military job involves a great deal of physical activity, the standards will be much higher. In general though, they want healthy, disciplined, physically fit people to be in the military, and the requirements are meant to exclude people who are not those things. Generally speaking, a man requires a much lower level of health, discipline, and fitness in order to reach the womens' standards than a woman does. The standards are just a proxy for ""in shape,"" and are in no way intended as a test of functional ability other than in the absolute broadest sense."	0
I believe that this rubs people's hackles because the brain easily confuses fitness standards with military might. The problem is this is not the case. Fitness standards are a basic notion of overall fitness. It perhaps at one point was something similar to the idea of firefighters, that any one firefighter, if called upon, could pull any other firefighter out of a burning building. It stands to reason then, that you would want to make the basic standards for a firefighter to be able to lift and carry 250 pounds (the most likely weight a firefighter and his gear would weight.) But in todays ever changing military, it is simply not necessary, nor is it wise to operate under the idea that any soldier at any moment could and would need to take the place of another. Psychological operations, networking, drones, smart-war tactics require much more variety in ability. This level of functional differentiation requires different skillsets. In the same way that we acknowledge that the Air Force requires more technical knowhow, we see different standards for physical fitness in the Air Force as we see in the Marines, where brute physical skill is more often necessary. We also know that adding the diversity of ideas is one of the things that makes this country great, and our military is no exception. Similar to the idea that female police officers radically changed notions of interrogation with detectives and brought a fresh, nuanced perspective to the craft of detective work. So, for the same reason that you shouldn't be alarmed that a long distance runner would be a terrible strongman, so should you not be concerned about the fitness standards being different for men and women. The only thing that is important is that women remain physically fit within their ability level, so that their mind will be kept sharp (the point of fitness) and their body ready to react with purpose. Our military will always have plenty of strong men to do what strong men are called upon for, and having a diversity of skillsets and ideas that women will bring will only enhance our military might, not weaken it.	0
I think sexual exclusivity in the age of birth control is asinine. CMV. If my partner wants to spend his or her free time (time that wouldn't be devoted to our partnership anyway) having safe sex (no pregnancy or STIs) with someone else, why should I interfere? And if my partner discovers that being with that someone else more of the time makes them happier, I should be glad that they are happier. Otherwise I'm just being selfish and possessive. In older times, when sex could easily mean babies or disease, having it with someone else could really damage your ability to fulfill your responsibilities to your partner. Today, sex can be safe and recreational. If a man finds out that his girlfriend had a great time and got laid after going out with the girls last night, he should be happy for her. If he doesn't value her happiness, why is he in a relationship with her? If he does value her happiness, why would he limit her pursuit of it as long as that pursuit doesn't limit his own?	0
Monogamy is meaningful to many people. It's a symbol of commitment to each other. I don't have sex with other people, not because my husband is controlling or possessive, but because I've promised not to have sex with anyone but him. If I did and he got upset, it would be because I've broken that promise. It would be the same in reverse. Relationships are frequently about commitments to each other. It makes me happy that my husband and I have something so special that we don't share it with anyone else. The fact that we don't have sex with other brings us closer together. It wouldn't make either of us happy to cheapen that. And ultimately, if people are happy being monogamous, who are you to tell them that they shouldn't be?	1
It's up to the couple and the mutual intent of the relationship. There is more than one type of relationship and none of them are asinine. Relationships range from one night stands to monogamous marriage and everything in between. Want monogamy? Find someone who wants monogamy. Don't want monogamy? Don't get into a monogamous relationship. I personally don't want sex with anyone but my love. If she wants sex with other people it's fine, but it's a sign that we have different goals and feel different about each other. If she values sex with other people over what we have together than the relationship is over. If we don't have the same goals and the same perspective on monogamy then we probably shouldn't plan on being together for very long. Some people like swinger parties, casual sex with strangers and having fuck buddies. Some people have sex for a living and still manage to have meaningful relationships. It's just a matter of your personal relationship and what your goals are as a couple.	1
"I think cyberbullying is BS, CMV Like a lot of people, I was bullied all through school. I understand that all of us are raised differently and not all of us are given the tools to deal with situations like these. I just don't think babying the kids is fixing it. It allows them to be a ""victim"". I know they are victim's but I mean in the sense of that's the tools we are giving them to respond. Aside from that, cyberbullying is even more BS. Maybe I'm just stuck comparing my experience to the fact that the internet is not a ""nice"" place. It just seems silly to think that when you add anonymity people won't be more cruel. At that point, it is literally JUST WORDS on a screen. You can delete posts, block phone numbers, delete accounts...so many more ways to just ""walk away"". Which is exactly what I and many others did when bullied in person. Edit: Great discussion everyone! Thanks for all your input!"	1
"I don't know your age, but there is one thing that you may not have considered: Things aren't the same as they were when you were growing up. You say that we shouldn't be babying these kids who are victims of bullying. Did you feel that way when you were being picked on? Or did you wish someone would do something to stop it? What tools did you have to respond with? What tools do you think these kids should be given so that they won't be victimized? I mean, we have laws to protect adults from harassment... Why do you feel that children deserve anything less? As far as Cyberbullying: It is easy to run away from a bully in person (which is what you say you did). It's a lot harder to get away when those bullies can track you to your home. Can harass you at an time of day or night. Can torment you from anywhere on the planet, regardless of where you are. Bullying no longer stops when you leave school or the playground. I would bet that when you were being picked on, you at least knew that when school let out and you got home, you'd be safe for a few hours. That you'd have a weekend free of having to worry about bullies. You had something to look forward to. That isn't necessarily the case anymore. Another thing is that, from what I have seen, it is rare that the cases of cyberbullying that we hear about only involved one bully. Usually, it's one or two who recruit others to join in. The feeling of anonymity that the internet provides does mean that more people will say things that they never would in public where others can see. That isn't silly. It is a proven phenomenon and there is a name for it; [the Disinhibition Effect] ( And saying that words on a screen hurt any less than words that are spoken. That they are any less real... well, that just isn't true. To conclude: Not that long ago, the internet wasn't as important as it is today. People didn't use it on a daily basis to connect with friends and family. It wasn't as important as a social tool. That isn't the case anymore. For the youth of today, the internet is just as important to their social life as having a home phone was when I was growing up (28 now). It is how we connect and stay in touch. So, while it is easy to say 'Hey, if you don't like what people are saying, don't listen. Don't log on. Don't look at those texts or IM's or Facebook Chat Messages..."", doing so would mean isolating your self from your friends and family. It would mean cutting out a large portion of your social life as well. It isn't as easy as 'just walk(ing) away' anymore."	0
"I think the idea that we're ""babying"" kids about cyberbullying is a little misplaced. I got bullied a little bit too but only maybe 5% of it was physical- bullying is really a psychological game. Combine this with the fact that the internet is a shield some people use to say awful things they wouldn't even say in real life and you have a new vehicle for insulting and intimidation that kids haven't had to deal with before. I know it can be hard to accept it as ""valid"" because it's not the situation we dealt with as kids but you have to realize how much has changed in the way kids talk to each other now. Instead of having to wait until after lunch or the corner of the playground at recess where the teacher can't see, these kids have smartphones and can say hurtful things from anywhere, any time of the day. Instead of a kid getting called a faggot at school once or twice a day he's getting facebook messages about how he should go kill himself. Cyberbullying is not only a real thing, it's a much more extensive platform for bullying than kids have ever really had to deal with before."	1
"I believe that the new ""score hiding"" system is poorly done and only makes viewing comment threads more annoying. CMV The intention is to allow people to not upvote other posts simply because they already have upvotes, but it didn't address the reason that upvoted posts gather more upvotes. No one looks at a comment and thinks, ""Wow, 2140 other people liked this, certainly it's worth another!"" Rather, the reason that upvoted posts accumulate upvotes is simply because they get seen more. People stop scrolling down at some point. And even with votes hidden, *reddit doesn't change the sort order*. Upvoted posts still gather upvotes like a torrent."	0
Often I find myself following the opinion of the mass. When I see a comment is controversial, I become especially critical to what is being said. And when I see a comment that has a very good upvote downvote ratio I rarely disagree, because I don't expect myself to. So I think it forces people to think more for themselves and not follow the hive mind. It's true that the sort order wasn't changed, this is necessary to not change the concept of Reddit's upvote system too much. It's a good compromise in my opinion, especially for discussion based subreddits like CMV.	1
The score hiding may not effect the order with which the comments are displayed over all but in threads, which are really the purpose of this sub-reddit as they denote discussion, it is actually incredibly useful in ensuring people remain unbiased. Far too often around reddit I see 'performance debates' where one speaker accumulates a great amount of upvotes and the other a great amount of downvotes. This causes people to gloss over the latter and simply read the first as they believe it to be the 'good' one. As we want people to read both sides of the argument and decide for themselves before giving upvotes I believe the Score Hiding system is actually very useful.	1
"I believe a woman cannot rape a man. CMV! Edit: Since I didn't follow the rules very well, let me expand upon what I mean. Sure, a woman can perhaps ""rape"" a man with a broom stick or something. I'm not saying that can't happen. And I certainly think a man can rape a man. I'm talking about penetrative vaginal intercourse. I don't believe a woman can rape a man in that way. **Last Edit: So it looks like this subreddit is pretty much a joke. Out of all the replies I got, only three even attempted to change my mind, and only one that I can recall was not openly hostile. It's really pathetic, considering what this subreddit is supposed to be. The vast majority of the comments were basically flaming and personal attacks, and ANY comment I made to clarify or defend my opinion was just downvoted into oblivion. It's kind of sad and pathetic that on a ""CHANGE MY VIEW"" subreddit, the userbase seems to be completely incapable of respectfully arguing with logic and evidence, and just succumbs to personal attacks. I shan't return here.**"	0
"Many men told stories of being raped by women here: There are statistics on this. According to the latest CDC (US government) survey, 4.8% of all men have been ""made to penetrate"" and 79.2% of the perpetrators were women. Examples of ""made to penetrate"" are: a woman who has sex with a man who is passed-out drunk, or a woman who forces a man to have sex with her through violence or threats of violence. There is some confusion due to the fact that their definition of rape excluded ""made to penetrate"" and only included men who had been penetrated. That was far less common (1.4% of men) and was mostly perpetrated by men. However, if you include ""made to penetrate"" as rape, which you should, since it is forced sex, women are a significant percentage of rapists, and the majority of male rape victims were raped by women. You can read the report at: Here are direct quotes from the report: ""Approximately 1 in 21 men (4.8%) reported that they were made to penetrate someone else during their lifetime"" ""For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims reported only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%)."" The above, lifetime stats do show a lower percentage of male victims (up to 6.2% of all men) than female victims (18.3% of all women) although this is far more than commonly believed. However, if you look at the report's stats for the past 12 months, just as many number of men have been ""forced to penetrate"" as women were raped, meaning that if you properly include being ""made to penetrate"" in the definition of rape, men were raped as often as women. Here are additional studies that show a significant number of female rapists: 1) This academic study of university students shows similar rates of victimization between men and women: Page 412 discusses the results for men and page 414 discusses the results for women. There's a nice table here that presents the results of this study in a clearer way: 2) Here's another study regarding sexual coercion of university students: 3) Here's another study: The conclusion states, ""the evidence presented here shows that as many as 7% of women self-report the use of physical force to obtain sex, 40% self-report sexual coercion, and over 50% self-report initiating sexual contact with a man while his judgment was impaired by drugs or alcohol""."	0
Here's wikipedia's definition of rape: &gt;Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse, which is initiated by one or more persons against another person without that person's consent. &gt;The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or with a person who is incapable of valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, or below the legal age of consent So, for instance, if a woman broke into a man's house with a gun, held it on him and made him have sex with her while under the threat of being shot, that would be coercing him into sex with her, which would be rape. Erections are also involuntary. For instance, a person who is unconscious can still get hard. Men who have broken their backs and cannot move their lower bodies are still capable of sexual stimulation and having sex. A woman who drugs a man and then has sex with him while he's passed out is raping him, and is having non-consensual vaginal sex. Those are two examples. There's also the example of [A russian hairdresser who knocked out, tied up, force fed viagra to, and repeatedly raped a man who broke into her store.](	0
Minors should have an opportunity to vote. CMV. I think that individuals who are under 18 should be eligible to vote provided they pass a test that would demonstrate they have clear understanding and knowledge of political issues. Minors that are willing to make the extra effort of taking a test (that citizens over 18 don't do) should be able to vote as their vote would be just as valid and educated as adult citizens.	0
"Validity of opinion is not part of the democratic process. That's sort of the point - it doesn't matter if you're thick or not, you have just as many rights as your fellow citizen. What you're proposing is that under 18's who are intelligent deserve more rights than the unintelligent. Furthermore, how exactly do you plan to quantify ""understanding and knowledge"" - it is totally subjective. If you study history, even modern history you aren't presented with a single interpretation of the facts and told ""that's how it happened"", there's dozens of different equally valid interpretations of a single event. Take a modern example, the Global Financial Crisis - was this caused by poor regulation of the banks by governments, or by people borrowing beyond their means, or by a global Jewish conspiracy. You can't really refute any of those options with complete certainty - so how on Earth can you test someone on it?"	0
I disagree on account that, before the age of 18 you are not considered an adult yet. Children in highschool *think* that they're mature and that who they vote for now, will be the same way they think in 4 years however that's probably not the case. I don't feel they're intelligent enough yet, or have the experience necessary. Lowering the drinking age to 18? I'm ok with. Lowering the voting age to 15, 16? No. The last thing we need is a politician pandering to 16 year olds with immaturity	0
I am extremely pro-gay rights, but I think it's gross. Can you CMV? Okay, I'm straight, but I find it disgusting and ridiculous we in the US are even having a debate about allowing gay men and women the same rights as everyone else. I do however, find is wickedly gross when I see 2 guys kissing or touching each other. Maybe less for girls, which is clearly another double standard. I don't want to view it that way, it makes me feel kind of shitty and I never bring it up because the few times that I have I get shitty looks and I've even been called homophobic for this. Obviously I'm not afraid or against homosexuality though. So.. is there any arguments out there that can CMV?	1
"No, because what you're describing isn't a thought. We can't reason with it. What you're describing is your mind reacting to something it perceives as being out of the ordinary, incongruous with your own experience of the world. I grew up in a country with no black people in it. Literally none. One day, I found myself in a small room with a black family. I had never seen a black person up close before and certainly never been a minority. I didn't find it ""disgusting"" but my palms sweat a little, my heart raced. And I was so frustrated and embarassed by my reaction! I had always been raised to believe that racism is a terrible thing. The important thing is to distinguish between what your gut feels and what you believe to be right. They aren't always the same thing. People who cite gut feelings as support for their beliefs are to be treated with extreme distrust. Also, maybe watch a whole load of vanilla gay porn, or all five series of Queer as Folk. The exposure will probably get you over this reaction."	1
"As a queer person, I appreciate that you're open-minded about this and recognize that your disgust isn't totally rational :) It may help you to know that while your disgust is a gut reaction, it is also heavily culturally reinforced. The fact that it's still with you isn't totally your fault. I don't know what it's like to be a young guy in middle school/high school, but from I what I know about it there's a whole lot of pressure to *not be gay* in any way, shape, or form. Other guys liberally throw around phrases like ""fag"" and ""that's so gay."" Some other people are replying saying that they had similar reactions when meeting black people for the first time. However, since overt racism is generally frowned upon in society, that disgust isn't as culturally supported, and you can get over it easier. I'm willing to bet that the disgust will lessen over time, especially if you make an effort to just be around gay people and watch them be casually affectionate."	0
"I don't believe in any kind of afterlife, CMV To start with, I'll say that I do think of myself as atheist but I honestly do not care whether or not any god(s), deity(/ies), creator(s), etc. exist. **I'm specifically interested in the existence of some sort of afterlife, or some existence of the essence of myself (meaning a sense of self, a personality, maybe some level of memory) after my eventual death.** I feel that because the brain and the body are our sources of the sense of self, our memories, our evolving personality, all of our emotions and sensations, that the death of our brain means the total absence of what we identify as a particular someone. **Why I want to CMV** I'm terrified of mortality and have been ever since I first realized I was going to die. I frequently get flashes of fear when I realize it's all real and I'm actually going to disappear one day, but most of the time I'm in a fairly comfortable denial about it (where I acknowledge its factual truth, but I'm not in an actual panic). **What I have already considered** I have already read all the quotes about how we're lucky to have just be born, how we won't exist to experience it so there is nothing to be afraid of, that it is the same as before we were born and there was nothing troubling then so it shouldn't trouble us now, etc. I know that ""energy isn't created or destroyed."" I have read [""You Want a Physicist to Speak at your Funeral""]( I know that immortality could eventually become torture. I agree with euthanasia. I know there are reasons why people might prefer death. I know that having a limited amount of time makes it all more meaningful and beautiful. I know that I shouldn't worry about the inevitable, but should instead make use of the time I have. I know that there are ways to support science in their pursuit of longer lifespans, I know about cryonics, the idea of the singularity. I have read Andy Weir's ""The Egg"" (which was a good story). I list these things just so the comments don't fill up with this sort of answer, because I've feared death as long as I can remember and have found all of these ways to cope myself. I have thought carefully about each. I have tried to believe in various forms of afterlife, with my favorites being some sort of calming heaven-like existence (as described best on Buffy the Vampire Slayer-- *""Wherever I was, I was happy. At peace. I knew that everyone I cared about was all right. I knew it. Time didn't mean anything, nothing had form, but I was still me, you know? And I was warm and I was loved and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about theology or dimensions, or any of it really. But I think I was in heaven.""* ) and reincarnation where you get to be born as any living sentience throughout the universe(s?). I think if I could get myself to believe in either, it would be a great comfort. I'm not interested at all in any organized religions. I've looked into Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Wicca (mostly through friends) and though I can respect most religions and admire the way they bring comfort, they are not for me. I don't wish to be convinced of any particular doctrine of faith, nor do I think I could be at this point. **TL;DR Section** I don't actually want anyone to convince me of any specific afterlife. I don't want anyone to convince me why having no afterlife is actually okay. **I want someone to convince me that some form of afterlife might be possible. Convince me (if you can, scientifically) that there is at least a *chance*.** Please CMV. It would bring me great comfort. For anyone who wants to read more on this topic, I suggest looking at [this CMV on the same topic]("	1
You're asking for something impossible. Anything that can't be observed requires faith to believe in. Since we can't yet observe the afterlife (if such a thing exists,) we can't prove or disprove it. It's also possible that we're actually in the Matrix right now; all of us. Or that none of you exist, or that I don't exist; or that I'm a banana. None of those things are useful discussions because none of it can be proven or disproven. What you have to do is decide whether you're ok with a) dying and vanishing into nothing, or b) after you die the thoughts, feelings and experiences that made you you will go on. Personally, I don't think I would live very long if I believed I'll just vanish when I die. I'm of the opinion that there is an afterlife because it's what I have to do for survival. It's a paradox that I'm fully aware of and accept. I don't know if my brutal honesty will help or hurt you in your quest for peace, but I do hope you hang in there. There's a lot of good you can do for the other bits of grey matter in this world.	0
I do personally believe in an afterlife, however, I cannot prove it so I am not going to try to argue it. But the reason why we are so driven to have sex is because our genes, our animal instinct wants to reproduce. It almost needs to. One may argue that the reason we have this desire to procreate is so that a piece of us does live on after we're gone. Our genes are still being passed on. A piece of my great great great great grandparents is still in me. My daughter looks almost exactly like me. Our things can easily be destroyed, but our genes are essentially immortal.	1
I think the only currently available way to get rid of HIV/AIDs is to start quarantining people who have the disease. CMV. [Quarantine]( Edit Note: I do not think people with AIDS should be quarantined in the traditional sense (I.e. Isolated from the community). Im thinking more along the lines of a voluntary online database, perhaps one that could only be accessed if the person with AIDS told you to check it. Something like this: * person A finds out he/she has AIDS * Person A then registers on this database, and informs his/her previous sexual partners. These people are sent a message with login information. * this could lead to people getting themselves checked out, and could lead to more people registering, informing their sexual partners, etc. I'm not sure of the logistics or how this would work out, but basically I think that people who have the disease HIV/AIDS need to be quarantined, added to a registry, or something like that so that they stop spreading the disease. We've spent Billions on AIDs research, but the current pharmaceutical technology we have isn't sophisticated enough to eradicate this disease. In the mean time, quarantining is the only other option we have. I know there could be a lot of social stigma around people who were quarantined, but I don't think it has to be that invasive (privacy wise). People with AIDS could be entered into a database that people without AIDS could check prior to engaging in sexual relations or the sharing of needles. That way, you (hopefully) wouldn't be discriminated against if you were buying a house, applying for a job, etc. I'll be back in a few hours. Thanks /r/changemyview! Edit: Thanks everyone! While I was definitely on the fence about this, the information presented here was excellent and definitely changed my view!	0
People can already voluntarily disclose their status; it's the ones that don't know or are lying you need to watch out for. And you already have a legal obligation to notify any any past and future partners if you have a positive HIV test. Failing to do so is a serious offense. If you mean medical reccords, obviously that already exists. But if you mean public database like rapists? That is a very dangerous implication. As I posted earlier, people will already hold your criminal history hostage for money. Victimizing people further for doing nothing but having an incurable disease is a terrible idea, as it will lead them to lying about it. By implementing these measures, you will terrify any involved, and actively discourage them from seeking treatment (as they will land on the AIDSWATCH.GOV). People will be more likely to lie about being healthy.	0
"Many others have said something similar to this, but I think it's good to restate: AIDS is way more a socioeconomical problem than a health issue. Condoms are inexpensive and very efficient to prevent infection and people being treated has almost zero chance of transmitting it. The world right now have technology and money to get rid of AIDS before finding it's cure, but we lack of information and distribution of this money. The said ""risk"" population are almost always in this situation because they don't know they should prevent themselves (like old people, who's been the most affected by the disease in developed countries) or people that suffers from bad governments, by the lack of condoms and treatment to infected. Plus, the people that uses injectable drugs, which is itself a social issue and people that gets infected in hospitals by blood tranfers and instruments, which is also related to investment in health. The simple bureacratic action of registering the infected has no effect at all above the real causes of AIDS spread."	0
I believe all mentally disabled people should be sterilized. CMV I don't think people with a mental retardation understand enough about sex to be able to reproduce. Not only that, but by sterilizing we are actually reducing the risk of mental disability in children. All people deserve to be happy and have a family, sure, but someone with the mental skill cap of a 4th grader, for example, is not fit to take care of a child.	0
* Autism is a spectrum disorder. Many people on the spectrum live typical lives, have degrees, careers, get married, and have families. There is no objective boundary of where you go from low functioning to high functioning autism. Additionally, it hasn't been determined whether autism is hereditary. Most research seems to indicate it is more likely environmental. * Downs syndrome is a mutation that causes sterility, so people with downs syndrome don't have children, and there is no genetic cause for it. * There are many types of intellectual disabilities, but the most common ones are not caused by genetic factors. In fact, the most common cause for intellectual disabilities is probably fetal alcohol syndrome. * People need to have the right to bodily autonomy. Forcing a person to undergo surgery against their will would probably violate our constitution's right to privacy. * This type of approach has been tried before, and it has always led to major human rights violations. The most well-known example is the Nazis. They forcibly sterilized all kinds of disabled people, including thousands of deaf people, who used to be considered intellectually disabled. * I think it's important when you're forming an opinion about something, especially where the stakes are so high, to do some research about how the experts feel about it. In this case, disability rights advocates are the ones who know the issues surrounding this question. They understand the needs of individuals with disabilities. Almost universally, disability rights advocates do not believe in forced sterilization. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people believe it, it's necessarily right, but it is a factor to consider when deciding how to feel about the subject.	0
The US actually had a policy of forced sterilization in the 1900s. Check out the Buck v. Bell case. Basically, this resulted in many women (mostly minorities and lower class women) being labeled as 'mentally retarded' and being sterilized without their consent, when they were in fact NOT mentally retarded. While I don't disagree that people with severe mental disabilities shouldn't have children, our history of forced sterilization shows that such a law would leave itself open to abuse.	0
I don't trust insurance companies one bit and thus never plan to get insurance. CMV First off, I live in a country that has a public health system, so I am not referring to health insurance in this. I just dont see how having insurance is better then paying for something out of your own savings. I feel in the vast, vast majority of cases you would save money this way. I feel that having insurance for a very, very unlikely scenario is just the same as gambling. I also feel that insurance companies will make it as hard as possible for you to make a claim and will try and reject you as much as possible (eg: 'Act of God'). I feel that government bodies who are supposed to regulate and monitor these such things have no teeth and dont make it any better. Even if you were to try to claim insurance for something very expensive, I do not think they would pay you. I believe the amount of claims that you would make during your lifetime will never exceed even half of what you pay for insurance. Everyone tells me I should get it so obviously there is something in it. I just need to CMV!	0
I'm not sure what type of insurance you're specifically referring to. But insurance in general is used to cover losses - especially on things you cannot afford. I agree with you, that you would not insure something that is worth very little. However, something like auto insurance could lead to protecting you from claims that would otherwise bankrupt you. You're measuring a cost benefit analysis. Odds of using vs benefit from using. However, that is not the way it needs to be looked at. Let me demonstrate with a numerical example: Assume: your net worth is $100000 if you get into a car accident, the damages will be over $100000 the probability of you getting into a car accident is .1% A car insurance company would charge you more than .1% * 100000 = $100 to insure you. Your implication (which I agree with) is that the more than $100 (let's assume $200 for the rest of my post) they will charge for insurance is higher than fair. Here is why I don't agree with you: With Insurance: Net worth = $100000 - $200 = $99800 No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $99800 Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $99800 Without Insurance: Net worth = $100000 No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $100000 Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $0 Would you not rather have a guaranteed net worth of $99800 (instead of $100000) than risk the chance of being completely bankrupt? That all having been said, if the numbers are the same and your net worth is 100 million instead of 100000 I can see your perspective as the worst case scenario would not put a large dent in your lifestyle	0
Insurance is the same as the extended warranty on appliances. You are paying more up front to prevent yourself financial disaster if something happened. Of Course the insurance companies are able to price premiums in a way they always stay profitable. You however get the benefit of piece of mind, knowing if the worst happens you are covered. Auto insurance is important because most people couldn't afford to pay a huge claim out of pocket and they also cover uninsured drivers hitting you. All insurance is probably considered negative lifetime equity, however they are important in helping people avoid financial disasters. One massive car accident, home fire or medical claim could bankrupt you and your family.	0
I don't think that dropping my Gifted 10th Grade Literature class for a regular english class is a bad idea. CMV I'm a Sophomore who finished Freshman year with As and Bs (with two gifted classes, Literature and Biology) I only learned I had this class the first day of school and did none of the required summer work because of this. ( I have until labor day to read two books, do two essays, and do two projects) A very significant Girl (to me) is in this class and I only have one other period with her and she is the only reason I haven't dropped it yet. I would actually like to have this class, but the amount of work being piled on me is really stressing me out and it's only the first week of school. So, uh. CMV?	1
"You're not going to look back at yourself in 5 years and say ""I'm so glad I took an easy english class"" You are somewhat likely to look back in 5 years and say ""I regret taking the easy way through school"". I obviously don't know, but I imagine this workload isn't quite as bad as you think it is. Stay focused on making constant progress, and if that isn't enough talk to the teacher (showing you've made progress) and ask for a little more time."	0
"If you are only in the class it is better that you drop. Receiving high marks in the regular English class will look better than bombing your GPA for the ""more prestigious"" English. Since you've mentioned it isn't AP or anything that colleges even care about a bit there it really isn't any reason to stay."	0
"I don't think ""ending the R-word"" is a worthwhile goal. CMV. For those who are unfamiliar with the campaigns to ""end the R-word,"" it is essentially a movement to stop the use of the word ""retarded"" being used as an insult or as a casual descriptor for something being dumb. The reasons for this are that it is insulting to those who actually have mental disabilities. The reasons I don't think this goal is worthwhile are threefold: * I do not see it as being any different from calling someone blind, deaf, or lame. It is simply another disability that is used to exaggerate a situation. ""How did you not see that huge sign? Are you blind?"" Acceptable. ""How did you not hear that car horn blaring at you? Are you deaf?"" Acceptable. ""How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?"" Unacceptable. My theory for *why* this is the case is that people see mental retardation as more integral to who people are. If you imply that being blind is bad, that's ok, that's obvious and blind people are more than their disability; they are a person *with* a disability. If you imply that being mentally retarded is bad, you are directly insulting and belittling retarded people. I would argue that this mentality has the negative effect of us further stigmatizing mentally retarded individuals by forcing us to see the disability and the person as one in the same. * People are not going to stop using this word. Oftentimes people compare this campaign with efforts to end the use of the word ""gay"" to casually describe something as being dumb. It is undeniable that mainstream use of that word has decreased in recent years, partially due to similar campaigns. However, the difference is that there is no inherent disadvantage to being gay; the only reason homosexuals are disadvantaged is because of society, and as society's opinions changed on gay persons, it made less sense to use that descriptor in a negative way. Retardation, on the other hand, is inherently disadvantageous and entails lower measures on intelligence tests and self-sufficiency, much like being blind or deaf are disadvantageous. While in the future we may see nearly no prejudice against gays, it will never seem weird to consider mental retardation as being disadvantageous and negative. * The casual use of the word retarded came about due to its initial designation as a clinical descriptor for those with mental disabilities. Even if we were to somehow end the casual use of the word, it would simply be replaced by whatever the new clinical term is. As I stated, people will continue to draw a comparison to this disability, which is defined by lower intelligence, when describing things and actions that are defined by their lack of intelligence. So there you have it. Hopefully you can change my view and help me see why we should be putting forth the time and effort to ""end the R-word."" Thanks, guys. **TL;DR I do not think that ending the R-word is a worthwhile goal because it is no different from casually calling someone deaf or blind, people will continue to use this term because retardation is inherently a disadvantage, and even if the campaign works, people would just start using the new clinical term. Also, by making the rules different for retardation than deafness or blindness, it implies that retarded people *are* their disability instead of affected by it. CMV.** Edit: /u/Shadygaga and /u/jwhitx changed my view! I'm enjoying this conversation, though, so I'd still love to see what you all have to say. Edit 2: /u/OctopusPirate shifted my view back to my initial position by [rebutting the points made by the previously mentioned users]( This conversation has given me a lot to think about, though."	0
The reason ”How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?” is unacceptable is because not every answer a person with intellectual disabilities (the universally accepted description, for everyones information) is wrong. Sometimes they give correct answers, and not just because of luck! The people I work with try especially hard to learn and be correct when giving input. I know this was just an example, and you probably have many others in mind, but there *is* a difference between a blind person not being able to see (they can't), and a ”retard” not being able to answer anything right (they sometimes can't, just like you or I). For the record, the people I work with are apathetic to the ”r word”, in every sense. They are also aware that they have special needs, and would prefer if the public stop walking on eggshells trying to explain it in any other way. Does that mean you should go around palling around with the friendly retards at the YMCA like your best buds? Probably not :)	1
"I think it is a worthwhile goal, but not a very practical one. Changing public lexicon is quite a stretch. But there's a very simple reason why it *shouldn't* be used. It's offensive to people who do have intellectual disabilities. I work with students like this, and they've been called the ""r-word"" their entire lives, and it brings up terrible memories of bullying and unequal treatment since as far back as they can remember. While it may seem silly or unnecessary to us, it's the equivalent of walking into a gay bar and calling someone a faggot. It's all about being decent to one another."	1
"I don't think there should be ""attorney privelege"" and that attorneys should be able to tell the court if their client admits to a charge. CMV I'm posting in CMV because I don't have a lot of knowledge in this area at all, but I hold this controversial view. I am open to learning about why this privelege exists. While I understand that a defense attorney is there to defend you, I don't see how making it illegal for defense attorneys to say when their client admits to a charge is helping anyone. People will explain this by saying, ""hopefully the courts figure out that he did it anyway, just have trust in the system"". But the system isn't foolproof, and I don't know how defense attorneys can live with themselves knowing that they are defending someone who should be charged with the crime! I don't understand the system at all. Attorneys shouldn't be forced to keep these awful secrets, and we all want the bad guys to get their proper verdict, so why have this rule? All this rule helps are the bad guys. The good guys aren't benefiting from this, because they (usually) wouldn't admit to something to begin with. This rule is only in place for the sake of ""the system"" and I don't know how good that system is. To know that there could be murders set free that would be in prison now if this rule wasn't in place is unsettling to say the least."	1
What about if a person doesn't know if she's innocent or guilty? Say for example someone commits homicide but doesn't know if her particular homicide is considered a crime in her jurisdiction. She needs an attorney that will not disclose so she can learn whether she committed a crime in the first place. This is separate from the prosecutor's claim of criminal activity. And the other issue is that when it comes to courts, people typically only want to reveal the personal/private information that is absolutely necessary for defense. Say for example the circumstances of the homicide involve a trade secret that, if made public, will financially ruin the defendant (even if the defendant is eventually found not guilty). If you made it so that the attorney must reveal what happened, then why would any client risk their financial/personal/social status? Also, the other issue is that it is NOT the attorney's job to determine whether someone is guilty. That is the judge's and/or jury's job. What you're asking is that attorney's decide whether or not someone is guilty of a crime... if so then why even have judges and/or juries in the first place? Another issue is that when you give people a chance to reach an attorney, that makes them more likely to stay within the system of government. If criminals feel that they have a chance of getting away free, they're more likely to turn themselves in than to hide out or continue to commit more crimes.	0
Even if the defendant is guilty, the defense attorney still has a duty to defend him: not for its own sake, but to keep the state's prosecution honest. Defense attorneys aren't protecting the guilty as much as they are protecting the Constitution and our judicial process. People need to be proven guilty based on the evidence. Prosecutors need to know that solid, factual evidence is the only reliable path to a conviction. The alternative is a government that can charge people at random and see what sticks. Imagine someone is brought to trial only on the strength of falsely planted evidence, then convicted because of statements made in confidence to an attorney. The state did not do its job. In fact, the state learns that planting evidence helps put the bad guys away-- even though there was originally no evidence that the suspect committed a crime. Maybe next week they plant the evidence in *your* car, and for whatever reason your attorney can't demonstrate reasonable doubt, and now you're going to prison for a crime you didn't commit. Keep in mind that a mere arrest can ruin a person's life: if you can't afford bail, you might sit in jail for *months* awaiting trial, losing your job and house in the process. As a sidenote, you're not only advocating the removal of attorney-client privilege, but several Constitutional principles including the right to avoid self-incrimination (5th amendment) and the right of the accused (including the guilty) to a competent defense. Also, the defendants comments would probably be inadmissible as hearsay even if attorney-client wasn't an issue.	0
CMV: I believe that the fuel economy benefits offered by hybrid cars is a myth due to a basic understanding of physics. It is my view that the fuel efficiency of hybrid cars is an absolute myth and that this view can be supported by a very basic understanding of physics. Note that I exclude plug-in cars from this statement. The manufacturers of hybrid cars make huge claims of offering fantastic gas milage due to their hybrid technology. Their argument is that as the car has a second electric engine, it can run around without using any gas what-so-ever at low speed and for short distances. They state that the gas engine will only kick in when the extra power is needed. This combination of gas and electric leads to the most efficient possible method to build a vehicle. I would counter this view with the following three key points: 1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking). 2 - Therefore, whenever a hybrid car is driven anywhere at any speed, on gas or electric power, it is carrying the weight of all of these components. 3 - A basic understanding of physics tells us that it is physically impossible to get more energy out of something than was put into it. When we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth. I reach the conclusion that the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there. It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. It is my contention that hybrid cars are developed to sell as a marketing pitch, and that in actual fact a straight up efficient gas car is a much more logical and efficient way to achieve good levels of economy.	0
&gt;1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking). [According to the Prius wiki]( the battery pack weighs 118 lbs. Since I can't find a figure online, let's say the electric motor components (which are the major components for regenerative braking) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing. So 218 pounds out of a total of around [2900 lb curb weight]( puts ~7.5% more weight onto the vehicle. Not as much as one might think. (It's also the weight of a full grown adult, so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo. Yes, that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy but it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking. &gt;It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved **significantly** less stopping than the average driver makes. At steady speed highway driving, you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size/efficiency combustion engines because it is simple physics. What you don't seem to be taking into account (or at least understating the importance of) is regenerative braking. 100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking. Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [as much as 50%]( of that energy. For the sake of keeping things honest, let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient. See the importance of regenerative braking? Using Newton's 2nd law, we can estimate that to get up to speed, Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy (and fuel) than Non-Hybrid X, but then when they both stop, Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses. This is especially important because vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed (Newton's 1st law). Yes, weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road, but the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all. So to summarize: Driving at a steady speed - slightly better fuel economy for non-Hybrids. Driving with braking - significantly better fuel economy for Hybrids. So like I said before, unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving (and even then the highway better not be very busy), a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart.	1
The simplest way to understand this is to break the energy consumption of a car into two pieces: acceleration and cruise. When accelerating the weight of the car is extremely important to fuel economy. 1% more weight = 1% more energy required to accelerate. At cruise weight becomes almost negligible because the primary loss is from drag which is not effected by weight. From the very first gas-electric hybrid the key piece of technology was regenerative braking. Suddenly instead of throwing out all the energy that was spent accelerating the car each time you have to stop you recover it and store it in a battery for later use accelerating. For most hybrids the main fuel economy gain comes from stop and go driving. On the highway, hybrids and close to identical as possible gasoline powered cars are not all that different. So lets assume that a hybrid Prius is ~10% heavier than a conventional Prius. So Hybrid = 1360 kg, Conventional = 1230 kg. Accelerating to 100kph uses H = 525 kJ, C = 472.5 kJ. Assuming they have identical efficiencies they use the same amount of fuel. Now they brake and the conventional loses all that energy while the hybrid recovers 50% of it. Next time they accelerate the hybrid uses 262.5 kJ from the battery and 262.5 kJ from gasoline while the conventional uses 472.5 kJ from gasoline. So even without any power source other than gas, higher efficiency engines, better RPM mapping, or any technology other than regenerative braking, the hybrid comes out on top.	0
"I believe people should not be allowed to bring babies in a movie theater except if it's a special ""everybody can bring their babies"" showing/theater. CMV People pay a lot of money ($30+ for two tickets and a pop to share for me and the wife) to have a bit of an escape from day-to-day life for a few hours. The experience is is enjoyable when someone so much as texts or talks during the movie...it is a downright miserable experience if someone brings their baby and it either starts making cooing noises or starts crying and the parent either does nothing or tries to get the baby to stop crying while still in the theater instead of taking it outside or thinking ""hey I'm probably ruining everybody's experience, I'll just cut my losses and go home"". I think theater chains should refuse patrons with babies unless it's a rated G movie. Empire Theatres in Canada has a ""Reel Babies"" showing for certain movies so parents can take their babies and not worry about disturbing others. I don't care if you really, really want to see the new Hobbit movie or whatever. I don't care if you can't find a baby sitter...those are the sacrifices you have to make when you have kids. Your wanting to see a movie does not entitle you to ruin everyone else's experience that they paid money for. Wait till the DVD/Blu-Ray comes out or see movies at special ""everyone can bring their babies"" showings."	0
When my twins were a week and a half old we took them along with us and our older two kids to see Cars 2. They each fussed for about a second when it was feeding time, but then we gave them their bottles and they shut up, ate and slept through the movie. When the movie was done the people that we were near said to us they didn't even realize that we had the babies with us. I think banning anyone is a stupid idea. But everyone needs to be respectful of other patrons. If one or both of my babies had been fussy and inconsolable I would have taken them out of the theatre immediately. If my older kids started being disruptive I would have taken them out of the theatre and given them an earful (cause they should know better). Edit: I wouldn't bring a toddler to the movies. That's just a terrible idea.	1
&gt;if someone brings their baby and it either starts making cooing noises or starts crying *and the parent either does nothing or tries to get the baby to stop crying while still in the theater instead of taking it outside* So this is the real problem. The part about babies is a red herring - if *anyone* is being disruptive, they should leave the theater. You don't need any sort of ban beyond that. Annoying people who talk through movies don't need a special ban. Slightly older kids that still throw tantrums don't need a ban. *Everyone* just needs to STFU in the theater, and leave (with parents if necessary) if they make noise. As a parent, we usually get a babysitter but we brought our baby to the theater on a couple instances when we were pretty sure he would sleep through it. We sat by the aisle near the exit. If he woke up and started making even the smallest noise, one of us was instantly out of there with him. The two of us saw different halves of Hunger Games because we were trading off with the baby in the hall. TL;DR: responsible parents don't need a ban in order to not bother other people, and inconsiderate assholes will always be inconsiderate regardless of what you ban.	1
"I do not plan on voting. CMV For context, I am a seventeen-year-old living in the United States. When I turn 18, I plan to register as an independent; when election days come around, I intend to go to the polling location and submit a blank ballot. I intend to remain somewhat politically involved aside from voting, at least to the extent of knowing what the issues are and where I stand on them. Here are my reasons for not voting: Voting, at least in the United States encourages an us-versus-them mentality, creating a vicious atmosphere. As a quick example of this, /r/politics was focused almost entirely on tearing Mitt Romney and the Republicans down last election season, building them up as the most evil people on the face of the planet. The voter is asked to accept a political party's complete list of economic and social ideals. You cannot separate individual issues at all--you have a few packages to choose from, no matter how much you may disagree with parts of each. By the very nature of this, voters are encouraged to agree with one side on all or almost all things. Because a person chooses to support a side, views presented by that side will tend to appear ""better"" than views presented by the other side, regardless of the views themselves. People who join and actively support one political party or another submit to a certain degree of mob mentality. The United States has many corrupt government officials and something of a culture of dissatisfaction with elected officials. I see this, in large part, as a result of voting. Voting selects for traits such as charisma, popular appeal, and so forth, rather than competency in governing. In addition, the process encourages--almost necessitates--lying. Even once officials have jumped through the hoops required for their elections, they will often make decisions based on what certain groups of their constituents want. You see this in actions such as the Republicans calling for a repeal of Obamacare (perhaps not the best example, but the first decent one I thought of): absurd proposals with no chance of succeeding, created purely to show that the politicians uphold the views of those who voted for them. Beyond all this, voting itself depends on the people, and that is perhaps my biggest problem with it. Everybody is encouraged to vote. If a person doesn't vote (and makes that clear), they are generally looked down upon--often considered unworthy of even holding political opinions. Becoming politically informed is given much lower priority. As I see it, this results in people voting when they really shouldn't be--voting not because they care, not because they have honestly and thoroughly researched and come to the conclusion that Candidate A is superior to Candidate B, but because it's expected. This gives the informed votes much less value--every thoughtful vote is drowned out by a dozen thoughtless ones. Building on that, voting gives people a sense of having ""done their political duty."" It is an entirely symbolic gesture--individual votes, of course, do not carry any weight at all--but it frees them from doing any more politically. If you're a voter, you've Done Your Part to support the democracy! I could go on, but this post is getting too long as it is. The reasons above should provide a good start, at least. In short, I prefer the symbolic gesture of not voting to the symbolic gesture of voting because I see a lot of systemic problems caused by the act and concept of voting. I am fairly firm in this viewpoint. I am posting in /r/changemyview because it is an abnormal viewpoint and I have held it for long enough that I suspect I am not giving fair consideration to points that support voting. I do not expect my view to change completely, but I would appreciate a different perspective on things."	1
"I have a few objections to your reasoning, and I'll do my best to explain them. &gt; Voting, at least in the United States encourages an us-versus-them mentality, creating a vicious atmosphere. Wrong. It's been shown that it's not *voting* that creates the Us vs Them atmosphere, but that such thinking is inherent to the labels themselves. There was an experiment [edit: [Link](] which presented subjects with the same media clip, but with a lead in emphasizing divisive labels (eg ""We're trying to find the opinions of Republicans/Democrats/Conservatives/Liberals on the following news report""), unifying labeles (""...opinions of Americans..."") or without labels at all (""...opinions...""), and the first group reacted significantly more strongly to the partisan slant than the third group, who reacted more strongly than the 2nd. As such, it is not *voting* for a republican or a democrat that makes you more partisan, but *thinking* of yourself as a republican or democrat (or any label, really). &gt; The voter is asked to accept a political party's complete list of economic and social ideals. You cannot separate individual issues at all--you have a few packages to choose from, no matter how much you may disagree with parts of each. This is the nature of representative democracy. Except because we're not a parliamentary system, in the US we don't vote for a *party's* ideals, but on a *candidate's* ideals. That said no candidate's ideals match yours to the point that you can vote for them in good conscience, then by all means, don't vote for them, but to decide ahead of time that it's not *possible* for a Republican or Democrat to hold the same values as you do is just as horrible a prejudice as deciding ahead of time that a black person or white person cannot, either; in both cases, you're treating people as their labels, rather than as people. &gt; People who join and actively support one political party or another submit to a certain degree of mob mentality. This is true, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't *vote,* it means you should not join a party. So long as you continue to *actively* think of yourself as independent, you will be able to resist that trend. &gt; Voting selects for traits such as charisma, popular appeal, and so forth, rather than competency in governing. Wait, you're rational enough to see that he masses *don't* think, yet you're just going to sit back and let them run the elections? That's silly. If you're better than that, vote on *substance.* Places like ballotpedia collect lots of good information on all the topics and candidates on your ballot. If you do your research, you can balance out at least one Charisma based vote with your Competence based vote. &gt; created purely to show that the politicians uphold the views of those who voted for them ...but that's their *job,* to reflect the will of the people who elected them. You wouldn't ridicule a state for enacting an initiative ""purely because doing so upholds the views of the people who voted in favor of it,"" would you? What's different here? And my final challenge is possibly the most important one: &gt; I intend to go to the polling location and submit a blank ballot That, fren, is *worse* than not voting. That potentially enables [an unethical poll worker]( to submit a vote in your name. Besides, isn't that doing exactly what you're complaining about in your antepenultimate paragraph? ""If you're a [blank] voter, you've Done Your Part to ~~support the democracy~~ protest!""?"	0
You could still support an independent that shares most of your views. You will never find someone you agree with 100 percent of the time. Local ballot measures matter. Unlike voting for a person, you could be needing to vote for/against a law, school funding, local taxes (income and property). Local races also affect our daily lives just as much as the big races that get publicity. Crooked sheriffs, crazy judges, idiot zoning boards.. Even if you don't agree with the major party platform, you can vote for/against individuals based on their specific job performance. What's more important than just voting? Actually participating. Run for an office, no matter how small, attend local meetings, and question your council members about their decisions. Let them know someone is paying attention. Submit letters to the editor of your local newspaper about your opinions of the city meetings. Circulate petitions to get local matters on the ballots, so the issues can be subject to vote.	0
I believe that no vaccine should be given to any child under one year of age, especially a newborn. CMV They never used to give vaccines to babies or pregnant women. I do not think that they cause autism, but at the same time, I see no valid reason to give a crap load of chemicals to a child who's immune system has not developed. I think at birth vaccinations are more harmful than the pharmaceutical industry lets on (i.e. mental illness rates have soared among children). Mercury is toxic. You shouldn't even eat tuna while you're pregnant. I'm not against vaccination, I'm a nursing student, it's a wonderful thing. I just don't think that we should administer anything that may derail a childs development at that early of an age. Vaccines should be administered after one year of age, at least.	0
&gt; I see no valid reason to give a crap load of chemicals to a child who's immune system has not developed. From the CDC at &gt; In 2010, 27,550 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) were reported in the U.S., but many more go undiagnosed and unreported. This is the most number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1959 when 40,000 cases were reported. In 2011, 18,719 cases were reported. &gt; Vaccinated children and adults can become infected with and transmit pertussis; however, disease is less likely to be severe. &gt; More than half of infants less than 1 year of age who get pertussis are hospitalized. From &gt; The younger the infant, the more likely treatment in the hospital will be needed. Of those infants who are hospitalized with pertussis about: &gt; - 1 in 4 (23%) get pneumonia (lung infection) &gt; - 1 or 2 in 100 (1.6%) will have convulsions (violent, uncontrolled shaking) &gt; - Two thirds (67%) will have apnea (slowed or stopped breathing) &gt; - 1 in 300 (0.4%) will have encephalopathy (disease of the brain) &gt; - 1 or 2 in 100 (1.6%) will die From this PDF , in 2012, there were 4516 reported cases of pertussis in babies under 1 year of age. 15 of those died; 13 of those 15 were under 3 months old. The first pertussis vaccine can be given at 2 months, IIRC from when my daughter was a baby. Now. That's the damage pertussis can do. What is the damage DTaP can do? From &gt; Severe Problems [from DTaP] (Very Rare): &gt; - Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) &gt; - Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include: long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness; permanent brain damage. These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine. Answer: nothing. There have been zero deaths from DTaP. Cases of severe problems (things that derail a child's development) are so rare it's hard to tell if they're caused by the vaccine. Recap: in 2012 alone, 15 babies under 1 year of age died from pertussis. Zero people died from the DTaP vaccine.	0
I do not have children, but if i did, i can assure you they would be getting vaccinated on schedule. The science is in, vaccinating children prevents them from getting sick. In the first six months of a childs life, the CDC recommends hepatitis b, diptheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccinations. Believe me, they are not doing it to make a child unwell. Is there a possibility that some children might have a reaction to these medications, sure. Its a ridiculously slim chance, way way lower than the chance of the child accidentally catching some of these diseases. It rankles that kids still die of whooping cough. Mostly from being in contact with someone who has been in contact with someone who has not immunised their child, or had not been immunised themselves. Why do you think that 1 year is the arbitrary point? What development are you derailing in giving a hep vaccine at 2 months? Im fairly sure the CDC did not create this schedule to put your child at risk.	1
I believe that grades in school are completely useless. CMV Ok, lets say I got a 3.7 GPA throughout my education. What does that mean? Am I really more qualified than a person who has a 3.6 GPA? How do grades translate into real-wold experience? I believe that someone who has done internships and has experience but who's GPA is a 2.5 is more likely to land a job than someone who has a 4.0 but no valuable experience	1
"I sometimes ""hire"" undergraduate volunteers for internships at a research laboratory. The advice I got from professors when I started to do this was to set a reasonably high minimum GPA (e.g., 3.3) and not even consider anyone who fell below it. After breaking that rule a few times and getting burned, I've come to see the wisdom of it. Here's my understanding now: * GPA is ***not*** a valid measure of how enthusiastic or capable someone is. * GPA ***is*** a valid measurement of how reliable someone is. When I'm scheduling brainwave recording sessions, I need to know with absolute certainty that the person I hired to help me collect data is not going to sleep through their alarm, miss their bus for the second time this week, lose their grandmother for the third time this year, drop out of contact all weekend because they're getting drunk, etc. A high GPA tells me that someone is willing to prioritize the work that they promised to do, even when it gets boring or they don't feel like it or it interferes with their social plans. I can see why real employers might care about that as well."	1
Grades aren't supposed to translate into real-world experience! That's why you should pursue internships, join clubs, participate in social activities, be a leader and blaze your own trail. High grades are valuable in telling employers that you could be a focused, diligent, quick-learning, and capable worker. A 4.0 student might learn quickly or retain information well, and that is important. But what matters is what that student does with that information to be a decision maker.	0
"I'm more comfortable pirating a famous band's music than I am pirating a small-time musician's. CMV I don't always pirate music, but when I do, it's a famous band's music. I'll tell you why. I think that small-time musicians need my money more than famous musicians do. I would feel much more guilty about pirating a local band's music than I would feel pirating, say, Billy Joel's music. Billy Joel doesn't need my $1.29, whereas a local band would certainly need it in order to make a career out of music. I'll much more willingly give my $1.29 to my friend's band than to Billy Joel. TL;DR: Famous musicians don't need my money, so I pirate their music more than I pirate a local musician's music. EDIT: I'm not saying, ""Nobody should ever buy Billy Joel's music ever again,"" nor am I saying that I will never buy Billy Joel's music ever again. I'm just saying that I would rather support local musicians rather than musicians who are already successful. If I have $10, and I want my friend's album and Billy Joel's album, either of which would cost me all $10, I'm going to choose my friend over Billy Joel. EDIT 2: I realize that pirating is wrong. However, the question was not ""To Pirate or Not To Pirate?"" That question was ""Why Should I Feel Guiltier for Pirating a Big-Name's Work Over a Local Band's Work?"" In this scenario, I am already going to be pirating a song. My CMV comes in when the choice of who to pirate from comes up. EDIT 3: I feel guilt either way, but I feel much guiltier if I pirate from a local band, who depends on every sale. If I'm pirating a song, it's very likely that I wasn't going to buy it in the first place. So the artist isn't losing any money. Or, what happens if they make a music video and put it up on Youtube? If I just listen to it on Youtube, and I never buy it? Should I still feel guilty over that?"	1
I would argue that pirating a small artists music is quite often a good thing. The biggest problem that small groups is that the vast majority of them languish is obscurity. Typically a group will become successful after some lucky break which has typically come from record labels signing them. But now that lucky break could be their music going viral via piracy which can lead to success. Think of it this way, piracy can be free marketing for a group that is otherwise unknown. If however your main point is that your money is better spent on a small artist, then you are probably right.	0
The only part that I would argue with, is the EDIT 2 part about pirating being wrong. If you truly support artists in your best ability, and pirate the more successful ones, then I would say that your attitude is significantly MORE beneficial to the music industry than those who would pay for every download. If everyone would act like you, then music could be a lot more diverse, with a lot of the billions that are currently hoarded by a few celebrities, spent on funding the existence of much more niche artists. If people would have stopped paying Billy Joel after his first million, then the rest of the money could have been spent on hundreds of other niche artists also earning their first million, instead of giving Billy Joel hundreds of million and let other artists leave the industry. In fact, I think we are already going in that direction thanks to the Internet. The celebrities of the mid-20th century sold a lot more albums than any of the the current biggest hits, yet we have a lot more indies making a living than ever. That's because when the Beatles were big, if you wanted to listen to them, you HAD TO buy an album, with few alternatives. Nowadays everyone feels entitled to listen to Gangnam Style on youtube, while the industry earns the same overall revenues, so apparently the money that Psy could have hoarded a few decades ago, is distributed between many smaller artists.	0
I feel like Superman is the most Mary Sueish hero, and I do not understand his popularity. CMV. Superman, to me, encompasses perfection. He's strong, fast, can fly, has pretty much every power under the sun that's textbook superhero fare, a very specific, and hackneyed weakness. His villains are generally more interesting than he is, but unlike Batman, who in my opinion acts more like a foil for the villains to be more pronounced on, Superman just allows any character his villains have to bounce off his chiseled countenance as he effortlessly pounds them into the ground. Yet every time a game featuring him comes around, he's perfect, every time a movie comes around, generally he's perfect. Hell, even in the most recent iteration, it took someone who was EXACTLY the same as him to even stand a remote chance against Superman in combat. He doesn't even have a power source that can be disabled (the Red Sun), so he's always super powerful when he's on Earth or in the Solar System, which is almost all the time. He feels like the most uncreative hero ever, but he's loved by EVERYONE, and I simply do not understand why.	0
"Let me explain it this way: Perhaps you're thinking of Superheroes too narrowly. Perhaps you're thinking that most Superhero stories go along the lines of this: Bad guy appears, Superhero beats bad guy. That's just about the most boring storyline structure ever. And that's the problem with your analysis: you think that a Superhero is defined by how he fights the bad guy. Let me present you an alternative view of why Superman is so appealing: He is our fantasy of justice. He's our fantasy answering the question: What if ""good"" were endowed with Superpowers? Given all the evil and terrible things in the world we live in, *what if* there were some really good guy that represents all our greatest hopes for humanity, with Superpowers that can put *everything* right. Grant Morrison put it in a much better way than I ever could: &gt;So we chose not to deconstruct the superhero but to take him at face value, as a fiction that was trying to tell us something wonderful about ourselves. Somewhere, in our darkest night, we made up the story of a man who will never let us down [...] &gt;Because it all derived from Superman. I mean, I love all the characters, but Superman is just this perfect human pop-culture distillation of a really basic idea. He's a good guy. He loves us. He will not stop in defending us. How beautiful is that? He's like a sci-fi Jesus. He'll never let you down. And only in fiction can that guy actually exist, because real guys will always let you down one way or another. We actually made up an idea that beautiful. That's just cool to me. We made a little paper universe where all of the above is true. We don't want to see Superman struggle (physically). We want to see him win. We want to see him save people, smile, and fly off to solve some other problem. We want to see him beat the crap out of evil aliens, and effortlessly round up the most dangerous of criminals. We want to see good triumph over evil. Superman is basically Jesus. He's God in the sense of omnipotence and in the sense of the greatest good, having just enough humanity to connect and make sense to us. That last bit is really important: the fact that deep down, he's just good ol' Clark Kent, raised on the farm with the best of parents, wants to help everyone, and *just happens to have superpowers* reminds us that we have that goodness within us. Humanity is also capable of that level of good and charity. So, now that we've established that Superman is no ordinary Superhero, let's answer your question: What makes an interesting Superman story. The answer is: not one where he can beat the bad guy physically. I'll give you an example. In Red Son: Superman is raised in Soviet Russia instead of America, and basically tries to altruistically take over the world and spread communism. [spoiler]And he easily does so. He restrains himself as he hopes that people will realize how much better Communism is (as ruled by an altrustic Superman), but over time he decides he just needs to take the reins, until Lex forces him to realize that he's basically playing god and humanity no longer has any agency. He ultimately realizes that he must let humanity choose its own way.[/spoiler] Alternatively, ""Luthor"" is a pretty good Superman story too. Except it barely even stars Superman saving the day. It revolves around Luthor's genuine fear that Superman, in being this godlike figure on Earth, completely cripples mankind's ability to progress because they see this *alien*, faster, stronger, more capable than they'll *ever* be, and there's nothing left for them to do. Luthor and Superman represent two different ideals of humanity. Superman vs. the Ubermensch (Lex). Whereas Luthor represents the peak capability of humanity (Lex is at peak human intelligence and presumably physical training, at the forefront of business, technology and politics, and a complete master of his own fate), Superman represents the greatest good in humanity (accentuated by the fact that he has godly powers but uses them altruistically). Now, what's a bad Superman story? I don't know, the Death of Superman or something. Oh look, it's Superman, fighting this monster that's stronger than Superman. Greaaaat storyline guys. If you want to read a story about a guy with gadgets or some cool power fighting cool villains, look elsewhere, at Batman or Green Lantern of Iron Man or something. Superman is much more endearing and enduring because he's now about fights and monsters, he's about the grand vision and greatest hopes of humanity. In his best stories, you walk away believing that some great moral principle has been won (or lost, depending on the story). tl;dr: Superman isn't your generic Superhero, who just needs to fight a bad guy and save the day. He's better thought of as a concept. And his best comics don't involve Superhero fighting Supervillain, they involve the ideas behind Superman and the ideas behind his villain clashing."	0
You forgot something. Superman is vulnerable to magic. The basic first level fire spell you tucked away in Final Fantasy whatever and forgot about? It can kill him. Whenever Superman goes up against the forces of Hell in a one on one fight, he's probably going to lose. Inside Hell? He was once written as having a complete emotional meltdown, followed by paralysis. There was nothing he could do to save anyone. Which is kind of important to him. You see, Superman asks the question - what does it mean to be good? What if you had the power to do anything anyone has ever wished to do...could you make the world a better place? And we allow him to do it, because we really wish we could. Only, he can't save the world, can he? All his powers, and his arch enemy is a guy who just knows how to work the system. Lex Luthor, has often been portrayed as just a businessman who loathes Superman because he's a God in human form. And so we have the story of an outsider who desperately wants to be our ideals vs. an insider who will use our worst instincts to tear a good man down. This is the stuff of opera and myth. Did I mention there's a love story? Lois, is a feminist. And insane. She's gloriously, wonderfully, batshit insane. How important is the truth to you? How many lives would you lose, to pursue it? What if there wasn't a Superman? How dead would she be? And she's up against....Clark Kent! Awkward farm boy, possibly autistic. Or a Buster Keaton short. It's impossible for anyone to be that pathetic, unless they're desperate to work on their stand up comedy when they're not being God and worshipped. [Being powerless as Clark Kent is all that keeps Superman from losing his empathy.]( But how powerless is he, in the information age where nerds/geeks have more social currency than ever before? That's for a better writer to answer. He badly needs updating, but he's far from lacking in potential, even now... But anyways, there's a love triangle made by two very weird people trying to figure out how to deal with each other at their worst, all the while flirting up a storm at their best. Which makes it much closer to the truth than most superhero romances....	0
I think the US reaction to Snowden's leaks is far more unsettling than the information those leaks contained. CMV Big fucking deal: the NSA tracks my phone and email records. Technically, they are reserving the right and ability to spy on me without my knowing they have that capacity. I don't like this at all, but TBH, I'm not really that surprised. I think it is absolutely terrifying, however, that: 1. they tried to keep something so obvious a secret. I don't even understand why. it's not like public review of this program would even compromise it. 2. they are so pissed off at Snowden. I guess he did break the law, bigtime, but you have to be a real cunt to chase the guy who spilled the beans on such an awful program. EDIT: After reading these replies, my opinion generally stands. To wit--duh, they were checking out suspected terrorists' communicaitons; lame that they didn't use a warrant; the beef with Snowden is based more on embarrassment than an actual crime against our country--even if snowden did break the law. EDIT 2: Lots of people are referring to nasty wasty stuff that snowden hasn't leaked yet. That is possible, but based on these comments, seems speculative. Top voted comment to give me credible reason to believe Snowden really has some nasty wasty shit gets a delta (note: this is legit use of delta. seeing *credible* info would have significant impact on my opinion).	0
"It is a pretty big deal that they can investigate U.S. citizens without a warrant. Everyone knew that the NSA had surveillance, what's unsettling is the realistic possibility of insufficient oversight of the program's usage, and the classification of the FISA court rulings which may have indicated the unconstitutionality of NSA projects. Specifically with regards to your points though: 1. Through one of the leaked papers we did not only receive information that the NSA was gathering private data, but also received information on which companies had agreed to be used for surveillance. While few terrorists would have used gmail and such before to discuss plans of attack, you can guarantee that with this leak gone public these potential sources of information will dry up. I personally doubt such channels of communication would yield much useful information, and don't think this is a valid reason to keep the program secret, but cannot deny that this leak did make the NSA's job of stopping terrorism a little harder. 2. Snowden has not released all of the data he left the NSA with, and word has it he has distributed encrypted copies of the data as ""insurance"" should he disappear. The language used to describe Snowden is disconcerting, but it is a legitimate concern that with him being in China/Russia that he may be forced to divulge potentially-damaging secrets to foreign powers especially with the implications of having an ""insurance"" data file. The reaction of my country to the leaks is very unsettling yes, in addition to the points you make, Congress has handled the investigation of the NSA quite poorly with terrible attendance at the hearing, mixed messages regarding the actions of the NSA, and not divulging any additional concrete information to justify their actions. However Snowden's revelations of a system which compromises all major tech companies, shares the data with various European nations, and can allow for warrant-less investigation of U.S. citizens is pretty damn unsettling."	0
Why does everyone think that Snowden's information indicates that the U.S. government is reading your e-mail? PRISM was not about data-mining, despite the original Greenwald article. The bigger story has been how terrible Greenwald's reporting was, and how ignorant of NSA operations Snowden actually is. PRISM's interaction with tech companies was no as a datamining technique, and it is not targeted toward American citizens. PRISM is, in a nutshell, a set of procedures to procure information from larger tech companies when complying with FISA warrants. Unless you have a FISA warrant out on your ass, OP, the NSA isn't reading your e-mail. And they don't know anything personally identifiable about you from phone records - they have non-personalized metadata from Verizon. They can seek a warrant and find out the *who* behind a particular communications device, but the information they have does not identify you.	0
Most Charitable Donations in the U.S. are Actually Luxury Spending. CMV. Tax-deductable charitable donations in the U.S. include giving to any one of a very broad spectrum of organizations. The missions of these organizations range from eradicating malaria and polio to funding the opera. Most charitable giving is unfortunately not anything near the best use of charitable funds to improve the lives of others. Causes are chosen selfishly by the donor, so it is really a form of glorified luxury spending. Around the world, it is surprisingly cheap to save a life. Give Well, a charity evaluation group which conducts independant research, uses $3,000 per life saved as a basic criteria for cost-effective charitable impact ( Top groups clear this hurdle comfortably. According to Give Well, the Against Malaria Foundation has saved one child life for every $2,500 it has been given, and can save one additional life for every futures $2,300 donation due to the savings it has achieved at a larger scale. Here is a breakdown of U.S. charitable donations in 2011: Of the $300 billion donated, 32% went to religious groups, 13% went to colleges and universities for education, gifts to foundations were 10%, support for arts/culture/humanities were 4%, and 3% of funds were unallocated (including carryover tax benefits and donations to government agencies). The combined total of this donation is 62% of U.S. giving, a healthy majority. Lets just take the 4% spent on the arts as a starting point. That is $13.12 billion dollars. Donated to the most cost-effective global charities, using the $3,000 per life measure, this money could be expected to save about 4 million lives. But in the U.S., we use it to pay for very talented classical musicians, visual artists, and poets to entertain the wealthy elite. Or take the college and university component. The average cost of one year of undergraduate education is over $20,000 at public colleges, and over $50,000 and private colleges (which receive a disproportionate share of donations) (source: Lets charitably assume that donations to universities actually go 100% to the core purpose of universities, and never get spent on things like athletics or fundraising costs or building gaudy structures etc. Even if that's the case, and even using $20k/year for 4 years as the cost of a college degree, every college education that these donations pay for costs the lives of about 22 people, who could have been saved by a cost-efficient use of that donation money. So how do I feel about fancy billionaires like T Boone Pickens, who donate tens millions to a unversity's football program and get rewarded with tax deductions and their name on buildings? Or ambitious social givers who spend $1000/plate on a fundraising dinner for their local opera? You can guess. Should I feel much better about the people who donate to U.S. medical causes which are maybe about 1/10th as cost effective as groups like AMF? Those causes are only 10% less wasteful than a giant donation to a college football team. So Reddit, Change My View. Convince me of any of the following: (1) Most donations in the U.S. go to relatively cost-effective groups. (2) Donations that go to grossly inefficient groups are still admirable charity and not just objectively inferior to cost-effective life-savers (note that I and Give Well both would try to give proportional credit to non-life-saving interventions like curing disability and chronic disease, etc). (3) Most donors are really trying to give to the best causes, not just selecting causes based on who has the coolest fundraising events, who is socially trendy, what improves life in their backyard instead of in some far-flung third world country, whose fundraising efforts have been most aggressive in targetting them, etc.	0
You can save a life for $2500 today, but that doesn't guarantee that any people are saved in the long term. Donations to save Rwandans from malaria in 1990 were not as effective as they seemed, especially considering that the ensuing slaughter seems to have had as much to do with overpopulation as with ethnicity. A $2500 donation to physics research at a state college won't save any lives in the short term, but it will rachet humanity ahead in a way that is much harder to undo than increasing the population of an impoverished country. And if there is a better state of society ahead of us, then by shifting us toward it, this donation may save more than one life.	0
"To this I would mention many many people donate to what emotionally impacts the donator. What if an underprivileged youth was granted the opportunity to see an opera, go to an otherwise unaffordable museum, or given the opportunity to go to college and this opportunity changed that persons life in such a way that they became hugely successful? Because of what helped them, the donator is going to support the organization that supported him/her. Basically, you are ignoring any possible emotional connection any donor may or may not have, which is to say most donors are really trying to give to the best causes. It just happens that not everyone agrees on what the best causes are. People are naturally going to give back to the organizations that helped them the most; in their eyes it is the best possible use for their charitable donation. Another thing to note: while plenty of people have pointed out that saving lives is not the only measure the effectiveness or worthiness of a charity, but I have yet to see anything that mentions fringe benefits (and a ""fringe benefit"" could be saving live). Who is to say that an underprivileged youth that received a life changing experience would not have otherwise become a murderer or some other detriment to society? Obviously complete speculation but I do think that it is worthy of note that these donations to universities, arts programs, and other ""non life-saving"" charities could, in fact, save many lives."	0
I believe that all schools in all stages of education should be free. CMV Just to be clear, I believe that no one should be **able** to pay for school (except for extra curricular things like excursions). I believe that the money which goes into schools and universities should come from our taxes and that schools should receive an amount of money depending on the amount of students attending it. The problem I have with the current system is that wealthier families send their kids to private schools and many poorer families are forced to send their kids to public schools. Whilst public schools can still be good, I don't see why any child should receive a better education than any other child, no matter how much money they have. If all schools were free to attend then eventually, I predict all schools would become much more equal, meaning that everyone would receive a much more equal education, which could eventually close the gap between rich and poor rather than widen it the way it does now. I assume this would be incredibly difficult to implement, but could it still work in theory?	0
Schooling system in my country(Slovenia) is almost exactly as you described. Education is free from primary school all the way up to phd. Everything is funded by taxpayers money so basically the only thing you need to pay for are books and pens. While attending university you also get different benefits like tax reduction if you decide to work, coupons for lunch so you don't have to pay the full price for your meal, cheaper monthly tickets for public transport, etc. Schools with tuition do exist. However their courses haven't been tested yet so there is no guarantee you will get a job when you get the degree. On the other hand such a system has considerable amount of flaws. Many people decide to abuse it for years so they enroll in a university solely for benefits, therefore they don't actually attend classes. Because of the crisis the government can't spend the same amounts of money for education, so they decided to cut teachers salaries. Consequently many of them became overburdened with responsibilities and extremely unhappy with their position, which decreased the quality of education. Many people also study for professions that don't have any demand on the market. To sum up, free education may seem like a good idea, however it cost a lot of money for the government(ours is almost bankrupt) and decreases the quality of education for everyone.	0
I lived in a country where all education was free. I was even getting paid a stipend while attending university. The quality of education was good, and the fact that it was free was a nice touch. Unfortunately there is no such thing as free lunch. Somebody still has to pay for it. The government that paid teachers' salaries took this money from my parents by paying them way less than free market would (most jobs were controlled by the government, so the government set salaries). The government also was notoriously inefficient, wasting money and resources. So I would rather pay for education directly rather than pay the government and let it pay for the education.	1
I think that the gender wage gap is due to the majority of women's decisions and not discrimination. CMV I know a lot of liberals are saying that women make 77 cents less than their male counterparts. However, I heard the libertarian's counter point and it's not that they are individually making less, it's just that women work less than men do as a whole. That being said, I want to say that **I am not a misogynist**, I believe women should be treated equally to men in what they do. So if a woman puts in as much hours, does as much work, and have as much education and experience she should be paid the same as a man with the same qualities. It's just that as a whole, women tend to be the care-takers. They also (as a whole) tend to chose lesser paying jobs. Ie; There's more men in engineering sciences. And there's more women in social sciences (Ie; psychology, etc). I believe that women are capable at doing whatever they want, however, women (as a whole) tend to have interests in jobs that pay less than some men do. And that is the reason why there is a gender gap. I believe we have evolved as a society to not discriminate against someone based on gender and race (for the most part at least).	1
I do think discrimination plays a (secondary) role, but let's leave that aside for a moment. I once read an essay on feminism (that I wish I could remember the author of to credit them) whose point was that if you care about fairness for men and women, what you should be asking yourself is not who is to blame for some perceived slights, but instead: if you were trying to make a society that's fair to men and women from scratch, how would you arrange it? For instance, your claim is that women prefer worse-paying jobs. Is this an accidental quirk of biology? My guess is that it is not. Historical forces have shaped which jobs women are more likely to go into (for instance because they have more female mentors, because it's more socially accepted, etc.), and also which jobs are better paid. Is this how it should be arranged if you were making it up from scratch? I really don't agree with a lot of feminists on a lot of issues, but I am very much in on the concept of the patriarchy as societal forces that enforce gender roles, that often are detrimental to both men and women. I think that is what is at play here.	1
"You unduly separate ""women's decisions"" and ""discrimination"". A woman's career choices can be affected by the judgments she expects from people. Even a simple ""I want to help people"" thought can automatically and unconsciously lead to teaching or nursing for a woman and being a doctor for a man. This is because of the lack of stereotype-breaking role models in children's lives. Additionally you fail to ask why all those traditionally female roles are less well-paid. Teachers' pay is set centrally so it's not just the market (although if something is caused by the market that doesn't mean it's not caused by the patriarchy too). Why do we value things women want to do less than we value things men want to do?"	0
I believe that it should never take more than a few hours the night before an exam to study. CMV I have heard many people talk about how students shouldn't wait until the night before an exam to study and I have seen many of my friends study for over ten hours for a single exam. I do not understand why doing this is necessary. The purpose of an exam is to quantify how well students understand material that has already been taught. Everything that an exam covers, the students are expected to already have learned through lectures, reading the book, homework assignments, labs, etc. At the point that a student is studying for an exam, all of the information they need, they should already know. It is my understanding that the purpose of studying is to refresh your memory and recall details about things you learned a month ago that you had since forgotten. If that is case, it shouldn't take more than a few hours to do.	1
&gt;At the point that a student is studying for an exam, all of the information they need, they should already know. This is why exam weeks were awesome--it was nice to be able to relax from the normal pace. Out of curiosity, are/were you a science or engineering major? I think those subjects lend themselves well to not having to study much for exams because foundational concepts are taught as the building blocks for more complex material. It seems that classes where early information isn't regularly referenced in later material (or logically connected somehow) would take longer to study for, since the material is easier to forget.	0
As a mathematics and computer science major, I personally study best from doing practice problems over and over until I've sharpened my intuition as well as my working knowledge of how the tools I have learned relate to each other. This process takes much longer than a few hours. In abstract mathematics especially, knowing the definitions simply isn't enough to be ready for an exam. You have to know how to attack problems, where hangups and issues can arise, and you're racing against the clock for the entire exam. Without having done practice problems to get me in the zone, I will not be prepared. Yes, all the homework I do over the course of the semester is good practice and helps me learn, but you move away from topics quickly and it's very easy to forget how to use certain definitions and ideas if you haven't touched them for a few months.	1
I believe abortion is not pro-choice in the sense that the baby itself is not the woman's body. CMV! To be clear, I'm not hear to discuss whether abortion is right or wrong as there are many more sides to that matter than just a woman's right to her body. I just believe that a fetus is a separate entity from the woman, it having a separate DNA for example, that the fate of the fetus is not part of a woman's right to her own body, being that is isn't actually wholly her body. Am I wrong in thinking this? I'd like to know. Again, let us refrain from discussing abortion itself as right or wrong as that is not what I want to discuss here. I believe there are many other arguments for and against abortion and in practical terms, what I want to discuss may mean little, but I would like to come to a better understanding of this particular argument.	0
Aborting a fetus which is not viable is choosing to remove life support, a choice granted to the host of life support due to the fetus not being an independent and competent adult. Doing this via abortion could be compared to an overdose of morphine rather than pulling the plug and letting the entire existence of the fetus off life support be a much slower and certain death. This would also be the choice of the host of life support. If the fetus is not a part of the woman's body, then she may remove from her body that which is not a part of her at any time she sees fit. This is not a matter of abortion as much as it is a right to remove what is not your body from your body.	0
A fetus requires a lot of resources from the woman's body which it acquires through the placenta. A large part of the placenta is the woman's body which induces a lot of change. So if it helps, think of pro choice as choosing whether or not to maintain a part of your own body: the placenta.	0
"I believe it is wrong to push your morals on someone else CMV. The only moral that I have ever tried to press on others is not to press your morals on others. A contradiction, I know, but a necessary one. I have always held the belief that I am intrinsically incapable of determining whether or not my own opinions are indeed the correct opinions to have. I simply cant, with any factual evidence tell you that I am morally superior. The only thing that I can, with absolute certainty, tell you; is that I lack to capability to be absolutely certain of anything. Which means neither can you, or anyone else alive for that matter. We are all painfully unknowing. To look at the morals of someone else and say ""I am right, you are wrong, change,"" is suggesting at the most basic level that you are certain that you are correct and superior, which you are intrinsically not. In doing this you elevate yourself to a level that god may not even occupy which, to me, is quite unsavory."	0
Here's the thing: there *is* no correct answer. There's no way to determine the truth, because no such truth exists. It's all completely subjective, like aesthetics. Morality is a person's *opinion* of an action, and opinions are neither true nor false. Now, some opinions are easier to hold than others. Humans have a bunch of tropisms that make a pretty girl more pleasant to look at for most people than a crawling horror of infected facial tumours, for instance. A fresh juicy orange generally smells and tastes more appealing to most than dogshit, and being kind to those who are kind to you also comes more naturally to primates than beating the crap out of people for no particular reason. However, that doesn't mean that beauty exists anywhere but in the eye of the beholder, flavour-goodness anywhere but in their mouth, musical talent anywhere but in their ear, or act-goodness anywhere but in their mind. So, just because you can't prove that your opinions aren't 'more correct' than others, doesn't mean you can't act on them. As an extreme example, imagine someone starts playing a Nickelback album... Generally, if you start digging around in your personal ethics, you'll find that you can reduce most of your gut feelings to a handful of simple principles - and anything left over tends to be a special case that you should probably work on convincing yourself against, or refining your principles to include. And the fun part is, other people will generally agree to those principles, or to judgements derived from them (in which case, you can generally hound them a bit into affirming the principles after all). As such, when someone's acting in a way you find blatantly immoral, chances are the person can't even justify it to *themselves* - and in the meantime you have a duty to intervene. And if they manage to convince you that their way conforms to a more elegant and better-fit morality than your own - then you've learned something new :)	0
"I definitely agree it would be wrong to push the more personal morals you seem to be talking about on someone through force or social pressure, but surely I should be allowed to push my morals through argument? If instead of saying ""I am right, you are wrong, change,"" I say ""I am right, you are wrong, for reasons X, Y and Z"" is that still wrong? Absolute certainty is also to high of a standard to expect people to have before acting on their beliefs. I also am wondering if you include things like evangelism and vegetarian in your list of morals that should not be pushed?"	0
"I am a 21 year-old who is rapidly becoming a hermit/recluse. I don't necessarily see anything ""wrong"" with it. When I was in high school I used to care a lot about how people perceived me. I didn't have many friends and was fairly shy and whatnot. In college, during my freshman year, I thought I'd make changes to my life to become more sociable. Unfortunately, I didn't change much because I stayed at home for school to save money, and moreover, I was still fairly shy. I'm in my last year and the pressure is beginning to pile up. Need a job, need research experience for grad school, still need to take tests, keep resume updated etc. On top of that, I want to keep my main hobby (writing) alive. I'm finding that making friends is becoming less of a priority. But at the same time, I'm seeing myself turn into an extreme hermit of sorts...what's troubling is that now I don't care. Before I cared about appearances, having lots of friends...now I have like, literally, 1 or 2, and I hang out with them maybe...once every couple months. Otherwise I really don't hang out or go anywhere. When I look at others, I can definitely tell that this is not supposed to be the norm. People go out on the weekends, have at least friends who text them about stuff that's not school related, go out to bars, have experiences. I just don't care anymore, but I think this may be dangerous. My twenties are supposed to be vibrant, or at least that's what novels and movies say. Change my view. I don't really necessarily want to be a hermit anymore, but at the same time...my parents don't have friends. Older people I meet seem to not have friends. When I was growing up, most of my classmates' parents didn't have many friends. It seems that having friends and ""doing life"" is something reserved for the young...then people have families/get hitched and loose interest to go out."	1
"I'll keep it short. That personal don't-care-what-they-think indifference is great; it'll keep you stable through interactions with obnoxious people and it will give you an admirable air of confidence in your personal and professional relationships. That said, don't take it too far. The funny thing about relationships with people (and we're talking friends and contacts here, not just SOs) is that they're actually difficult to maintain. You have to generally make some effort to set time aside, call folks you haven 't seen for a while, and set up activities. Going bowling, going drinking, going shopping, whatever it is you do with people - it's not going to ""do itself"". What that means is that you're sort of copping out. You're taking the easy, lazy route through your 20s by letting your relationships lapse because you simply don't need them right now. You're doing the minimum amount of work to maintain the level of social interaction that you currently desire instead of maintaining contact with people.... And here's the important part. You might not need a lot of people in your life right now, but some day, you *will*. I'm not talking about just getting lonely. The bigger your network is, the more opportunities for jobs, romance, and entertainment you have. The more often you interact with people you consider friends, the better you get at being friendly. If you let your network dwindle to two friends and they both decide to move, you're going to be a very lonely person on very short notice and you're not going to have the skills to do anything about it. Friendship skills are just like programming languages or knitting: Don't use it for a few years and you won't remember the finer details. Let those skills atrophy and some day you're going to find yourself alone, unemployed, and *really* wishing you had some people to call. When you see people moving up in their career with opportunities banging on their doors, you're going to wonder why no one's offering you your next job. Keep up with people. The older you get, the more you'll want people who knew you when you were younger. Cutting ties by attrition is a terrible, terrible plan at this point in your life."	0
It's not that it's wrong to be introverted, it's fine. I'm an introvert. I'm good with it. That being said, life is better when you share it with others, even for an introvert. Suffering softened and success is sweeter when shared. Friends and family are important, and while it might not always be your favorite thing to do, if you care about them you'll make an effort to be a part of their lives. It will be difficult at times, but you owe it to them to be there for them and take and interest in what's going on. It's also important to develop social skills. The subtleties and nuances of human interaction are complex and many. No matter how good you think you are, you need to be getting better at it. Whatever your job, whatever your interests, you will be better at your job and your hobbies if you are better with people. How do you do this? You talk to them. I know it's not always fun and it can be exhausting, but it's important to go out and interact with people. Years of reclusiveness puts you years behind others in terms of social development. You can always learn something from other people. Not in the preachy sense, but I'll assume you're not the lone expert on your field, so I can say that you will learn better and perform better if you can communicate better. And that takes practice. Always improve yourself. Be a better man for yourself and for the people you care about, and part of being a better man is making an effort for others by being social.	1
"I believe a lot of people will never find ""love"", CMV Before all, I'm talking about ""common"" people, not the ones with major mental disorders, etc. Just people that you'll find on the street that seems ""normal"". Also just to clarify I'm talking in the strict sense of a partner, as an spouse or lover. Heterosexual by the way. And friendship it's excluded from this view. That's another topic. According to wolframalpha there are 2.177 billion ""adult"" males and 2.113 billion females. Of course demographics vary from country to country. But basically in every culture, there are people that can't find a partner due to psychological or physical problems. Or it may be that the peer group of ""x"" individual isn't large enough or doesn't have so much contact with the opposite sex. There are so many factors but in the end it may reduce to a problem with the subject or with his/her environment.. Also, like you read above, there's an unbalanced number. There are more females than males,, and a lot of people are turned off by competence. Those are external factors, but is in human nature to look only for the best ""genes"" to perpetuate it's existence, so a lot of *ugly* people seem to struggle more than a *pretty* person to find a partner. Monogamy and all of that is another matter. Also if we look for dating sites on the internet, it's just more complex, because in my experience there are 10 males for 1 female on dating sites (aprox). And so women become more picky, and so more males find it difficult to get a partner. So, despite humans being *social animals*, some of them are destined to be alone* for the rest of their existence. And this cycle will continue for the rest of time, or the duration of humanity. *Alone in the sense of not having a close relationship with another human being. Tl;DR; Some people are destined to be alone due to psychological, social or just chance factors, and thus will never find love, or a partner. Edit 1: [take a look at R4R]( for any given female, her post it's more likely to have 5 or more replies than a male one, which in average will have 1 or 2 replies, if he is lucky, of course that isn't a rule, because female more likely will send a private message than a public post, still it shows something. Edit 2: [Now I understand the Weltschmerz]( :("	1
So...this is awkward. Because I'm not single. And for the past 8 years or so, I've been horrible at remaining single, despite several sacred oaths to stop dating. But I'm also short, poor, unemployed, a few rare shades of mentally ill, a few common types of physically ill and I'm certainly not making up for it in looks. Did I mention I'm terrified to the point of flight or fight or, if I can't escape, fetal position paralysis when anything even vaguely sexual happens? Because it's not the social handicap you'd imagine. At least, not with other introverts...or trolls with a fucked up sense of humor. ... So, yeah, my girlfriend is both of these. She likes it when other people are more afraid than her... But nevermind that. You're right, a lot of people will never find love. For some, that's a happy ending. Bullet dodged. As for those who do want to find love, well, most find their way there. What are they doing right? It's not like it's a big secret... Stop approaching love like it's a fairy tale. If you're just looking for love, it generally means you're in love with love the way Wallstreet can't enough cocaine, or you're just desperate for someone to save you from drowning alone. Both are considered great warning signs in anyone over 17. Because there are a lot of people out there who are terrible for each other. The girl who is trying to survive a pornographic Night of the Living Dead reality is not going to respond well to the guy who confuses the dirty sense of humor she picked up along the way for an actual proposition. The guy who has been mocked for his old fashioned romantic ideals doesn't need to hear that he's creepy from the woman who was suffocated by old fashioned romantic ideals before she ever met the guy, nor does she need to hear his insults because she still goes to church. The woman who paid all the bills in the last relationship needs some stability and support, but people who read her profile think she's a shallow golddigger. One of them is a guy who pays child support to the woman who cheated on him and gave him a persistent cold sore. Former victims of abuse keep meeting up with new abusers. Etc, etc, the variety is endless. You know how it goes. Without working with any specifics, we can't hope to change your mind. Any advice we give to those without love will be wrong for someone, somewhere... Edit: But who wants to play it safe? Here's a few tips. Don't confuse them for anything in-depth. They're mostly here to break up some myths about how difficult all of this is. Appearance: learn the color wheel, and how it can compliment your skin tone and highlight your eyes. Trust me, it's witchcraft. Fitness: Work out enough to at least not be dead if you need to climb two flights of stairs or go for a walk together. Beyond that, it varies. Some women want a steel panther, some women want someone skinny, some women want a soft pillow. Some just skip down to the next category... Intelligence: You know how to Google, right? You can speed read the results faster if you don't mentally read them out loud to yourself. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions. The more open ended, the better. (You may need to apologize in advance, depending on how much you should already know...) Smile: when you mean it. Faking it? If it only lifts your lips, you're making everyone who can read your eyes very uncomfortable. Listening: Active listening, without judgement. If you're not good at it, you'd better be damn entertaining about it. If you can't manage either, throw a saving dice, and look for a girl who is just as bad. A lot of genuine love is finding someone who understands and forgives you for what you can't do. Memories: You'd be amazed what making weird in-jokes nobody else can understand can do for two people. Don't force it. Let it grow naturally. Oh yeah, and let people know you're interested in them...but don't pressure them for an answer right away or corner them. Practice makes perfect. Location to start things off: Make friends who have friends. Get a hobby. Avoid anywhere where the men greatly outnumber the women. It's not like online dating sites and Reddit are the only places in the world.	1
It seems like a core assumption in your argument (correct me if this is wrong) is that people will have only one relationship in their lifetimes. This is in fact wildly inaccurate, and many people will find love 2, 3, or even 10 or more times in their lives. As such, it's certainly possible, even if there are wildly unequal numbers of men and women, for all of them to find love at some point in their lives. Imagine, for example, a society with 100 men and 20 women. If those women have an average of 5 or more relationships in their lives, it's definitely possible for all 100 of those men to find love at least once in theirs. &gt;Edit 1: take a look at R4R, for any given female, her post it's more likely to have 5 or more replies than a male one, which in average will have 1 or 2 replies, if he is lucky, of course that isn't a rule, because female more likely will send a private message than a public post, still it shows something. R4R is a terrible example, because Reddit is nowhere near representative of the entire world when it comes to ratio of men to women. Your stats put it at somewhere around 2.177/2.113, but on Reddit it's more like 3/1 if memory serves.	0
There are no defensible arguments for the existence of a god. CMV I'm not asking anyone to convert me or prove god exists. This is purely about the existence of any defensible argument for the existence of God. I haven't found or heard any argument for god that doesn't fail in its premises, or by a subtle case of special pleading or circular logic. Because of this I have trouble believing people who were not theistic from childhood, but decided later in life that the existence of god makes logical sense, and I'd rather not suddenly feel that someone is a bit dumb because I don't know of any sensible argument that they could have run across to convince them. Edit: Success, to /u/turole ! Tl:dr of the argument: To someone not versed in logic and theology, ontological and comsological arguments can be very convincing. They might not pick apart the arguments as heavily as I would, or it might not occur to them to pick apart the arguments. However, I should see this as a lack of theological or logical research/training/knowledge rather than seeing them as a little dumb. That is, ignorance is not stupidity.	1
"I'm not going to address your top points as I am an atheist who agrees. I think your second paragraph could use a wider perspective. You need to understand that there are plenty of intelligent individuals who haven't thought much about religion that aren't well versed in a variety of fields. This can be used to suggest particular arguments arguing for certain God models. &gt;Because of this I have trouble believing people who were not theistic from childhood, but decided later in life that the existence of god makes logical sense, and I'd rather not suddenly feel that someone is a bit dumb because I don't know of any sensible argument that they could have run across to convince them. There are many arguments that *appear* strong. One example that I can think of is the [ontological argument]( (Platinga's and Anselm's are the most popular in my experience). If someone were questioning their religious beliefs, coming from an atheistic starting point, and they aren't well versed in logic then the ontological argument seems quite strong. What of those that define God as ""A timeless being that is the cause of the universe"". Then all of a sudden we have first cause arguments and teleological arguments for further support. Again, if you aren't well versed in cosmology and haven't seen any formal objections to the premises these arguments can appear to very strong and support this definition of God. Arguments for design in regards to Abiogenesis are also strong at a glance. Very few individuals understand the hypotheses currently put forward or the experiments conducted. There are plenty of smart individuals who believe that there was non-life and then *bam* a single celled organism that we would recognize formed. This confusion can be used to question the probability and then suggest that there must be a guiding hand of some sort. I do agree with you when it really comes down to it that there aren't any defensible arguments when they are really analysed, but there are some that intelligent individuals can possibly accept when they aren't well versed on the failing points."	0
I'm an atheist personally, but one good argument I've heard for belief in general is that there is no way to live your life without belief. Logic itself is 'unproveable' (or at least so I've been told, and based on the arguments I've heard). Even probability itself, based on this fact is also 'unproveable'. So why do we use it? Because we believe out of pure faith that it does work. Religious people just take this a few steps further and believe in more things out of pure faith too. Ideas of arguing itself come from belief, so why does belief in a God then have to come from arguments?	1
I believe that organ donation should be mandatory. CMV. Recent legislation has passed in Wales to require people who do not want their organs to be donated on their death to [opt out of the system]( rather than the current system where they have to opt in if they do. I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but that it doesn't go far enough. I believe that all people's organs should be made available for donation, if required and healthy, when they die. I believe this for a few reasons. Firstly, from a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I don't see how we can possibly justify not bringing as much good as possible from someone's death. If someone dies, and someone in the bed next to them requires their liver to be transplanted or they will also die, I don't see how anyone can justify not allowing them to have that liver transplanted into their body. If the shoe were on the other foot, I'm sure they would want that liver. I don't see how a religious objection can be brought to the table, because what religion would want one of their followers to deny life to another human being if it is in their power to do so? If a religion believes that abortion is murder, then it should also believe that refusing an organ donation is murder. I can only see positives to mandatory organ donation. CMV. *Edit: Your replies have me convinced. Thanks. Opt-out organ donation is the way to go. Opt in leaves too few organs, whereas mandatory donation upsets a metric fuckton of people for a huge number of reasons.*	0
Probably late, but just to add, my organs are shit. I have complicated medical issues that have damaged my organs, muscles, and skin. I can't donate blood either, because it could kill the person. I HAVE to be able to opt out of organ donation, because my conditions are not things doctors would test a transplant organ for, normally. Unless I grow sick, have to stay in the hospital a while, and then die, the doctors wouldn't know, and they would kill someone with my organs. [Mainly with my blood] If I got in a car accident for example, and was pronounced dead at the scene, but the other person needed a kidney ASAP, what doctor wouldn't want to put my kidney in them? It LOOKS healthy. Opting out is my way of preventing people from dying.	1
If you are arguing simply based upon a utilitarian standpoint, think of this scenario: you have 3 individuals at a hospital that are going to die if they do not receive an organ transplant. One needs a new heart, one needs a new kidney, and one needs a new liver. Now down the hall there is a perfectly healthy man who has all 3 of these organs. Would not the utilitarian perspective be that we kill this individual to save the other 3 lives. Greatest good for the greatest number. Now this doesn't seem right does it? Individual consent is necessary from a moral standpoint. Professor Michael Sandel has a great series of lectures on this topic. Having mandatory organ donation would incentive murder and would cause society to put more emphasis towards this organ donation, rather than to what I believe would be the most practical method: increase the advancement of biomedical engineering and artificial organs.	0
"I believe *more* socialism is needed for the U.S. to prosper CMV In spite of the cries from some media sources that Obama is a socialist and that socialism is bad, I firmly believe the opposite is true. Obama is *definitely* not a socialist and that a little more socialism in the U.S. will help our country prosper. In addition to the socialized institutions we have now: police, fire department, public schools, postal service, etc. we should also have socialized health care, higher education, and utility services that everyone depends on like electricity, natural gas, and water. I have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now. New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus, but I think broadening the income eligibility would be a great solution, even if buyers had to pay the full premium. I had to pay the full premium as part of a child support order ($78/week) and would gladly pay that for myself or other members of my family. Some communities already have co-ops (publicly owned utilities) that are much more reasonable in price than private or corporate-owned utilities. I have yet to find someone in the service area of a co-op complain about their service. The city I live in sold their publicly-owned (municipal) water company to a private entity. No change in service, yet the cost of water and sewer service has literally tripled since the change. I think these are essential to public well-being and should not be monopolized by a for-profit corporation. The only compelling argument against this I have heard so far is that private corporations will spend more money on R&amp;D and innovative technologies. I think advancements and new technology will still happen in the universities, grant-funded research, and so on. Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom. [**Edit**: I understand that this isn't *exactly* socialism... but it's a lot closer than what we have now.] [**Edit 2 - Clarification**: My idea of ""publicly-owned"" is more along the lines of a [Utility Cooperative]( where ""Each customer is a member and owner of the business with an equal say as every other member of the cooperative, unlike investor-owned utilities where the amount of say is governed by the number of shares held"". I am *not* necessarily advocating utilities be ""government-run""]"	1
"Ok, I'm a high school debate student and the topic you brought up is one that is often debated. I'm a liberal, more than most, but economically I don't think we need more socialism in general if out goal is economic prosperity. I agree with your points on heath care and basic utilitys (internet i hope) but I really do disagree with you on higher education. Before I go into the meat of my argument I want to establish what parts or forms of socialism are effective and what parts are ineffective. The two sides of the scale are capitalism and communism(duh), and socialism is somewhere in the middle. I argue that socialism does not have anything unique about it, to be effective is must use some capitalist policies and some communist policies. If you try and split the difference you end up getting neither. The examples in the US are Medicare and Medicaid, Section 8, and more recently social security. These are all government run programs that use a mix of Public and private funding and today are a drain on the gov. and increasingly less effective. You can have a socialist society where one sector, say heath care is under total government control(to provide it to everyone) or under all private control(to increase tech and keep prices low) than both will achieve there goals. By extension this means that when you a a partially subsided or half government controlled sector then you end up with a mess, high prices low tech innovation. (this referrers to government capital not regulation.) Higher education should not be standardized or payed for by the government. 1. Today higher education is overemphasized and is not catered to those who would benefit from having it. 2. Only 30% ish of the people have the mental capacity to benefit for college ( Dorrel, 11). This means that you would have to have the US government either supporting or carrying out tests that say, ""You're in, and You're not"" or they would just let everyone in. The former is unconstitutional and the latter is not realistic or cost effective. 3. You have have no mix or government money without impacts that outweigh the benefits. Government money in a private sector will drive prices up, so while the Gov. intentions were good the have actually created a bubble that will burst very soon. 4. Government funding is ok but it would need to be done through a subsidy contingent upon low prices not loans. 5. Government run colleges will halt scientific research as we know it. Now, despite student loans, there is stem cell, cancer, biochemical and other kinds of research going on. If the government took over the schools any tech advancement could be grabbed, halted, weaponized kept away from the public. This possibility halts advancement in general and would hurt humanity as a whole. 6. Finally, the fiscal argument. Colleges cost alot, and they won't make money in the form you are suggesting. Simply put, we don't have the money and that is a reality everyone has to face regardless of philosophy. Any retorts , kritits or comment i please leave them"	1
Firstly, as a side note: Obama upholds democratic-socialist platforms. While he is not by definition a socialist, he advocates for socialist variations of domestic policy, to varying extents. The real problem with your argument, while both reasonable and rational, comes in the last paragraph: &gt;Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom. This just isn't the case. Here's why. Economically, socialism doesn't allow for capital-based transactions, and directly opposes supply and demand based thinking. This means two key things: profits don't exist, and instead of valuing things via the market, products are valued by the amount of production it took to make them. Capital no longer exists. Ultimately, while companies would no longer enjoy profit margins, neither would the workers: revenue would be sufficient enough (theoretically, assuming Marx was wrong and that his Exploitation of the Worker and/or Alienation of the Worker from Products won't occur in a capital-based system) to continue operation and ensure workers receive the minimum sustenance they need to survive. Therefore, there *wouldn't* be liquid assets anywhere (Proving Marx wrong, see above). In fact, if there were, it would be because companies were proving Marx's predictions true and exploiting the workers. Additionally, on a less theoretical note, our budget is stretched historically thin. Federal debt is rising fast ( and many of the social programs will become more expensive as the baby boomers become older. As these programs' pricetags are set to only increase ( simultaneously increasing other programs will only, if under current budgeting, increase the mess further. Simply, there is no money left to create. Even so, if we raised the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and the funds that give into Medicare/Medicaid, the primary sufferers would be employers. This would lessen small business's ability to operate, and allow only big businesses to reign supreme, so to speak. Essentially, to respond to your argument: it is neither theoretically nor practically possible for us to adapt more Marxist/Socialist policies without hurting, to some extent, either workers or small business owners. It would only cause big business to profit more, and give them greater incentive (&amp; arguably, ability) to become (more) fraudulent and corrupt.	0
"I believe men shouldn't be expected to put the toilet seat down for women. CMV It is considered common courtesy that when men finishes his business in the restroom, he has to put the seat back down for the ladies. In fact, many men are chastised and criticized for not doing this. This entire social ""courtesy"" seems absurd to me. We are continually working to level the playing field for women in society, and women and men alike often get offended when women are treated like dainty, delicate creatures who can't get their hands dirty. This is an archaic view of femininity that was used as a reason to deny the vote, women at work, and other socially and politically limiting rights for women. Expecting men to put the toilet seat down for women perpetuates inequality and this idea that women are too feminine to adjust a toilet seat. Men have to grab and raise the seat to use the restroom, and then touch it to put it back down again. Again, it's not so much the effort men have to exert, but about the symbolic gesture it sends towards our attitude of women. Men must do the dirty work for the women, and women can't get their hands dirty. If the toilet seat expectation were simply for aesthetic reasons, I probably wouldn't care so much, but the argument continually asserted for why the toilet seat must be put down by men is often that there ""are women in the house/office."" All I think it does it perpetuate age old sexism and views of femininity, and it is an outdated social custom that needs to be abolished for the good of all humanity. Change my view. **EDIT**: I mean just the seat, not the lid. The lid closes the entire toilet from use, the seat is what you sit on. I'm talking specifically about the seat of the toilet. **EDIT 2:** Shout out to [this comment]( by /u/Internomer for changing my view. I'll post here what I replied to him: Before you take this post too seriously: yes, I know it's only a fucking toilet seat, and no one is actually getting hurt/being sexist, but it's the theoretical/logical component behind it that I'm addressing. This original post was written in a kind of tongue-in-cheek fashion, with some broader, somewhat legitimate points being made. It wasn't supposed to legitimately piss anyone off, just create a friendly debate surrounding the custom. But anywho, shout out to /u/Internomer for chaning my view. ∆ This argument, one of choice, is the best answer I've heard, and it wins my support. Logically, leaving the seat how you left it means each person, male or female, has to exert energy the same amount of energy each time, either putting the seat up or putting the seat down depending on gender. This is all based on the assumption that a man must put a toilet seat up in order to urinate. But /u/Internomer rightly points out that a man can choose to urinate sitting down or standing, and taking this presumption into account, neither person of either gender would have to do any work because the seat would be down at all times. I also think it addresses the sexism aspect. A man exercising his choice to stand rather than sit is fine, as long as his choice does not infringe on the woman's necessity to sit. Should a man flaunt his privilege by leaving the seat up when he just as easily could have peed sitting down, I think he is inflicting harm upon the women. While there could still be a radical feminist argument lambasting a man for feeling compelled to put the seat down because he is sympathetic towards a woman's lack of privilege that a man has with his choice of sitting or standing, I think that's taking things too far. This argument wins!"	0
I recently changed my own view on this from yours to the view that actually, I should put the seat down. My thinking was this: Men can choose to stand, or to sit. Both valid options, though many men would tell you (due to some ridiculous idea about 'masculinity' or something) that it's standing only as a guy. You can stand or sit. Sometimes, I choose to sit - it certainly minimises the risk of a disobedient member blasting the rim with piss. Women don't have that choice. Every time, they have to sit. So you're in the position of having the privelege of choice. Every time you choose to pee with the seat up, you're forcing the next occupant of that loo (if female) to put the seat back down. However, the reverse is not true; if a woman leaves the seat down, you are presented with a choice - lift it and pee standing up, or keep it down and sit (or risky option number three, pee through the reduced-area target of a down seat). It's not about empowerment or perpetuating inequality, it's about recognising that the privelege of choice is yours, not theirs - so don't be a dick. Another way to think about it - a house of 2 men will need to lift and lower the seat depending on their preferences and due to the fact that you can't poop standing up (unless you're incredibly talented). A house of 2 women will never lift the seat. So if you moved each of those people into a house together, the rule 'leave the seat down when you're done' means nobody has to change their seat awareness - the men have to raise or lower it from time to time, and are aware of that, but the women do not. Which seems, to me, to be the most fair way of doing it.	1
&gt;Men must do the dirty work for the women, and women can't get their hands dirty. How is it fair that you lift the seat but don't have to replace it back into the position it was in when you found it? It's not about men having to do the dirty work for women, it's about men doing their own dirty work that they created themselves. Men are not forced to stand to pee. They have the choice to sit if they don't want to lift the seat. It's one thing if you have a place that you don't share with other people, or you live in a house with all guys who don't need the seat down but once a day or so for a BM, but otherwise, you're basically asking other people to clean up after you. Clean up after yourself.	0
"I think homelessness should be illegal. CMV I think people who live on the street need help, even if they dont want it. Large denominations of vagabonds are drug addicted, and need therapy. Many are runaway children from broken homes with no life skills, and need guardianship. A large number are insane, and need to be evaluated, medicated or put into an institution. And let's be honest, many need a shower. On top of all that, a fair number are criminals, concealing weapons (two of my friends got stabbed/bottled downtown by beggers) But when I tell people I think the government should make vagabondry illegal, and ship em off to ""help facilities"" I get looked at like my last name is [Manderley]( Or even Hitler. While the responsible citizen in me recognizes the danger in giving government power to ship off people into detention/forced care, I can't help but feel that some people need it, especially against their will, if their freedom will lead them into drug addiction, crime, prostitution, illness, unplanned parenthood and potentially death. Are my views wrong? Edit: I forgot to clarify, I'm canadian. I don't support the war on drugs, or the overblown US incarceration."	1
And how do you propose to pay for all of this? Sure it's a noble effort that you want to get everyone the help they deserve but this would be a massive effort and require the funding and man power to back it up. Also people have lies where they are, who is to say that you may relocate someone who just recently became homeless and is looking to get bak on their feet. Also you assume that all homeless don't have jobs. I've met quite a few who do work all day and struggle after because they cannot afford housing because they simply do not make enough money.	1
&gt; I think people who live on the street need help, even if they dont want it Many people actually enjoy this freedom. They enjoy traveling, working in different locations, etc. [Hobo's are 'workers who wander,']( and even have their own ethical code. I don't think it's right to force them to conform to societies expectations, i.e. living and working in one place. I personally have moved between several states in the last few years for job opportunities. If a State had suppressed my ability to move, I likely wouldn't have had the ability to learn new skills, and become more valuable. &gt; Large denominations of vagabonds are drug addicted, and need therapy. Many are runaway children from broken homes with no life skills, and need guardianship. A large number are insane, and need to be evaluated, medicated or put into an institution. And let's be honest, many need a shower. On top of all that, a fair number are criminals, concealing weapons (two of my friends got stabbed/bottled downtown by beggers) But this is a reason to arrest the ones that break the law, not the ones that are over all good citizens who just like living on the streets. If anything, we should make it easier for people to live on the streets without being harassed by police officers. It also raises the notion of why people live on the streets in the first place. Is it zoning laws, lack of unaffordable housing, restrictions on structures (i.e. tents are illegal), [because so many psychiatric facilities were closed in the middle of the last century, with no laternatives being created]( etc, etc. Rounding up homeless people and putting them into 'reeducation' centers does nothing to stop new people from becoming homeless, or to address the underlying mental health issues that often *can't* be treated with drugs or even therapy. &gt; While the responsible citizen in me recognizes the danger in giving government power to ship off people into detention/forced care, I can't help but feel that some people need it, especially against their will, if their freedom will lead them into drug addiction, crime, prostitution, illness, unplanned parenthood and potentially death. If you think people need help, you should donate your time/money at homeless shelters, or helping homeless people in other ways if possible. There's absolutely no reason to give the Government any power to round up *more people*, especially with their current track record of putting people in cages (re: [The Drug War]( Perhaps if the Government had a track record of *actually* helping people out, instead of making situations worse, they would be a good candidate for this task. However, I see no evidence of this, and think it's best to let people do what they want, so long as they don't hurt other people.	1
"I dislike gender identity as a concept. CMV. Okay, so here's my understanding of the issue. Everybody is born either male or female, and this is your sex, but whether you are a man or a woman is a an issue of identity, and is independent of your sex. That is, one can be born a male, but later on in her life, realize that she identifies with women and women traits, and thus decide to identify as a woman. She would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns, start wearing girl clothes, practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine, may or may not get genital/chest surgery and/or hormones, and then, she would be a girl, and do girl things. Here is where I have the problem. What are ""Girl traits""? What are ""Girl things""? I have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and non-discrimination. I dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race, orientation, etc., and as such, **I don't consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine**. And I think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits are. When did we decide what traits are? What is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl? Or a boy for that matter? What, if you're...sensitive or something, then you're a girl? I'm a pretty sensitive guy! And I can tell you, there's ALL SORTS of things that I do that other people would consider ""Girly"". But the thing is, I think people are full of bullshit. I mean, I don't really *care*. If people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns, I would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldn't correct them. It's just, I don't get it. To me, assigning certain traits to a gender, and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seems...backwards. It seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles. Like, if you're a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresses...well, wearing dresses doesn't really help you identify as a girl, does it? All you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl. All wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look. That's not about how you perceive yourself, it's about how you want society to perceive *you*. Like, when you tell me you're a girl...well, great, I just learned nothing significant about you at all. That doesn't give me room to presume anything about you, it gives me no information. So why is it such an important identity to so many people?"	1
You're generally right—it is stereotyping to assume that someone is of a certain gender based on what activities they enjoy and it isn't accurate. However, that isn't really how it works. I'm a trans guy and I like a lot of different things: a lot are 'masculine dudebro' things and a lot aren't. In the course of a single day I can spend hours playing video games, reading or watching shitty TV shows ranging from Pawn Stars to Hannah Montana. I don't regard any of these things as 'female' parts of me. I am inherently male. There is not other way to describe it; it is just who I am. I know that I am a man the same way that I know that I am attracted to women or anything else intuitive. It's absolutely integral to my identity. If I were to put on a dress it wouldn't tap into some female part of me because of some ridiculous notion of gender roles, I would just be a really uncomfortable man in a dress. On to your point about how we are perceived in society: you have never known societal discomfort until you have lived a day with Gender Dysphoria. Hearing 'ma'am' or 'miss' all day every day is the kind of thing that can just make you want to lay down and die as a transgender person. It may seem shallow and unnecessary to pander to what society expects of us but there are two reasons for it: one is that stereotypes are absolutely based in fact—they are really just a variation on what psychologists call 'schemas' or really quick bullet points about something that your brain can pull out at the mention of a word. Basically all those little pictures we get in our mind when someone says 'little old lady' or 'Scotsman'. The reason these exist is that they are based on truth and are your brain's way of saving a bit of time because memorising each individual aspect of each individual little old lady or Scotsman you meet is a daunting task. These are only detrimental if we grow to rely on them too much and don't allow them to adapt or expect everyone to fit accurately into our schema which will accurately describe only a handful of people. So basically gender roles are a schema: girls do this, boys do that. My little notecards in my noggin say so—and they are absolutely accurate as a *generalisation* which is why you will find that many trans people do fit these stereotypes of their true gender well. Some things fit people and others don't but as a whole we don't do a half bad job of distinguishing girls and boys (assuming we don't argue that these ideas are set in stone). Equally, there are people on the absolute opposite end of the spectrum: outliers who don't fit into any of their gender's roles. This doesn't make their dysphoria and need to transition any less valid. If you can't tell from my previous points, I strongly disagree with the war on gender roles: used correctly there is absolutely nothing wrong with them (they should, of course, never be forced on someone against their will). They exist for a reason, that reason being that they are fairly prevalent and our brain has decided 'Aha, I should file that!' However, that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge spectrum in between. It's just a basic starting point for what our brain associates with men and women. The second reason is that, for our emotional well-being, us trans folks absolutely *need* to be gendered correctly. It is pivotal to our survival. As such, there is a huge need to 'pass' within the trans community: the easiest way to do this is to dress and act ways that are typical of the gender they want to be seen as. It is a sad fact that people make brash judgments based on what we wear and how we present ourselves; however, getting the average person who has never thought about gender in their life to consider that gender is really on the inside and not the outside is going to be a long and hard battle. As such, it is just easier to conform (and realistically it is not viable for a trans man wearing make up and showing their breasts to be seen as male to the general population—whether it should be or not is controversial even within the trans community). So basically, in my opinion, it is not that a person who fits female stereotypes *must* be a woman or that a person who fits male stereotypes *must* be a man: it is that these people are women/men and as such align with some (but generally not all) of the tropes of their gender because they are rooted, to some extent, in truth. I hope this is somewhat useful to you—I'm running on no sleep so if there's anything convoluted you want me to clarify or you want me to answer other, more specific questions, then go right ahead! Edit: Typo fixes.	1
"To start with, a disclaimer. I consider myself agendered and don't identify as a gender one way or the other. For the longest time I ""identified"" as male simply because that was what my body was. I was always confused as to why some people felt so strongly about their gender, or why people would want to identify as something else (outside of changing the physical appearance more towards the general appearance of the opposite sex which I always assumed was for cosmetic purposes and I embraced). It wasn't until I got involved in the lgbt community due to my sexual preferences and got close to several transgendered individuals that I realized what I was missing. Everyone has this core identity, this idea of who they are. This doesn't mean that they view certain things as ""manly"" or not, it's just that they view themselves at their core as a man or a woman. It's like saying I'm white, or that I'm a geek, or that I like tacos. It's just a thing that is an integral part of them. Things became ""manly"" because people who identified strongly as a male would stereotypically follow that pattern (sidenote: stereotypes are based off of perceived averages and oftentimes are mostly useful for marketing purposes. I recognize that individuals fall along WAY more boundaries) and vice versa. Once I realized how people felt I tried to explore within myself to see where I fell and what I identified as. I realized after a long time of soul searching that I didn't. I just didn't. Sometimes I feel like a man, sometimes I feel like a woman, most of the time I feel in between...and that's what caused me to not understand the issue. I'm not saying that this is the same for you by any means, but maybe it's worth doing some soul searching about?"	1
I absolutely despise atheist organizations that attempt to remove public religious symbols. CMV For me, it's a simple cost-benefit analysis: Benefit: -Arguably upholding the constitution (letter of the law which no one really cares about, and doesn't affect any individual's rights or group's rights) Cost: -They manage to severely piss off, alienate, unify, and reinforce religious people against them -They give atheists a bad name, and come across as fundamentalists -They waste precious resources (money, time, and manpower) that could have been used for causes that actually do something for humanity This is all a matter of crocodile tears. Public religious symbols, along with God's name on currency and in the pledge of allegiance, don't do any harm to anyone. The vast majority of people are not ready to be weaned off religion yet, and forcing them off the teat in a publicly militant fashion helps no one. And if it's about indoctrination, do you seriously think that the beliefs of kids raised by atheists who are taught to question everything would actually be changed by the insertion of God into the pledge of allegiance? Please...	0
"A benefit you're missing: (Or, alternately, a cost to having the religious symbols): The symbols placed there/supported by gov't are alienating those that don't share those beliefs, especially if the gov't says ""yes, religion X can have its symbols there, but not religion Y, and definitely none for atheists"" A school that emphasizes that it's ""one nation under god"" is telling non religious (or, say, polytheistic students) ""you're a second class person here. This is one nation under _GOD_, and you're an unamerican poopyhead if you don't accept The One God"" That's a nontrivial cost indeed. Further, it tells _others_ that it's okay to alienate those people."	0
&gt;Public religious symbols, along with God's name on currency and in the pledge of allegiance, don't do any harm to anyone. Public religious symbols can mislead religious people, who have the ability to influence public policy, about the separation of church and state. Many times I've heard the argument that this is a Christian nation, and that it was founded on Christian values to push policies that violate this separation. Also, if you can understand why it would bother religious people so much to remove those symbols, is it so hard to understand why some atheists would be bothered by their presence?	1
CMV: Being spied upon does not take away your freedoms. What are you not free to do if you are spied on that you were free to do before? There are things that many people do that are illegal that they can't do if they are spied on, but the aren't _really_ free to do them if they aren't spied on, they just get away with it. Being spied on is obviously different if a specific person you know is doing the spying, but the government/FBI/CIA/etc. is not a specific person, its an organization. If they watch you have sex or whatever that doesn't effect your life at all except maybe for some discomfort at the fact that you might be on tape, which I think people should just get over. Note: this does not mean I condone widespread spying by the government, I just think that freedom is not a good argument to use against spying. There are plenty of other good ones to use.	0
Consider the Panopticon: It's based on a reliable observation about human behavior: that we act differently when we think we're being watched, even if we aren't. A dummy camera can often be equally effective as a real one. People restrain themselves when they think they're being watched, but the problem is that it's their own imagination of what the spy will do which governs their behavior. There is no policeman as effective as the one inside our own minds.	0
I believe SMBC put it best: Also, it's interesting how the government can dare to spy on its citizens, but the citizens don't yet have the right to a fully transparent government. With the scandals lately, it's ironic that the government wants to know everything you're doing, but hardly knows what *it's* doing.	0
As disappointed as I am with current US government, its crime against humanity is nowhere near what Japanese did during WW2. CMV Some people on Reddit think an American (who they thought I was one of), has no moral upperhand to criticize what Imperial Japan did to Koreans and Chineses, because of Guantanamo Bay and drone attacks (something about how Americans elected the representatives who support both of these things) I think their implication is that Guantanamo Bay and drone attack are on the same level of crime against humanity as atrocious act of Imperial Japanese Army. If a Nazi sympathizer condemns what Imperial Japan did, then he/she has no moral upperhand. So, please change my view P.S. I'm not supporting neither GetMo or current use of drone attacks.	0
"(For full disclosure, I am Korean btw) I don't know if you can compare one country's crimes with another's. Each country's crimes are unique, and what each country did was unique to its time period and place. That being said, the US has quite the laundry list when it comes to invalidating the sovereignty of other nations: * Sending troops to aid the White Army during the Russian Civil War (1920's) * Toppling Iran's democratically elected government and re-instituting the Shah's power, twice * Basically controlling the politics and ruling governments/dictatorships of South America until very recently – essentially, if a government was deemed a ""threat"", no matter how good to the people they were the US stepped in and immediately toppled them * I haven't even touched the Middle East yet. Is this nowhere near what Japan did? I don't know. I really don't think you could compare the two."	0
"Well... America has been toppling governments and engaging in quasi-imperialistic wars since Japan was a baby. Other commenters have listed many good examples so I'm not going to repeat them. To make the discussion even fairer - because why limit the comparison to only one country? - the European empires were as bad and sometimes worse than Japan, for much longer. From essentially genociding all of North America to turning the entire Congo into a brutal slave labour camp to fighting a war with China just so they could get the whole country addicted to opium. When we hear about these atrocities we generally think something like ""that was terrible, but it was a long time ago, and things were different."" Or even if we don't rationalize it so; the genocide of Native American tribes and theft of their land doesn't carry the same emotional weight as Japan's invasion of China, or Operation Barbarossa. And the enslavement and brutal treatment of the Congolese by Belgium, while shocking, doesn't start discussions about whether or not America has moral high ground over Belgium. When is the last time someone got pissy at Britain on reddit for the Mau Mau uprising? We keep stirring up controversy and talking about how terrible Japan was for lots of possible reasons. Here are some guesses: 1. Their atrocities are more recent (though in the big picture, not really that much more recent at all) 2. They lost the war, while the West's atrocities were usually roaring successes 3. They aren't white, and it bugs us more when non-white people do bad things than when white people do My opinion is that Japan was, for no more than 50 years and really only like 10 of those, a bit worse than the West was on average for the previous ~300 years. And so no, America has no high ground whatsoever."	0
I belive AA is only a temporary solution for alcholics. Not a healthy long term solution to treat addiction. CMV I came across this today on [Reddit]( . While most of the comments sympathize with giving the guy a damn drink, I find it very disappointing that a person dedicated to help alcohol addicts broke down and caved into his problem. This is usually what happens to these people who devote their entire lives to AA meetings and then all of a sudden stop. I've known people who are in AA. Someone in particular who has been going to meetings for 20 years once downright told me if she stopped, then she would go into a downhill spiral of abuse. The program to me seems that it strips away your will and makes people rely on dependence of being addicted to this program instead of alcohol. The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. This on one hand can be a great environment and a very welcoming community that some people need. However, it's not something that I believe is a healthy way to quit and stay sober. Also on a different note, for Non-Christians it can be very awkward because of the heavy influence god has on meetings.	1
"As a recovering alcoholic, I hope I can shed some light on the subject. It's not uncommon to run into what they call ""dry drunks"" in the meetings. People who have essentially replaced one addiction with another, albeit a much healthier one (being ""addicted"" to being in AA vs. being addicted to the drink). One of the main tenets of any 12-step program is the need for character change. I find the program, at times, to rely heavily on semantics, and I don't live my life by all their rules. I have, however, found a lot of help and wisdom and insight from the people in the rooms. There was an episode of Elementary where he says something like (I'm paraphrasing), ""I don't mistake the ethos of the program for a guide to living"". &gt;The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. As a recovering alcoholic, I feel that you are grossly misinformed with this line. This isn't true. The urges, for me, and I can *only* speak for me, subsided greatly over time. I don't wake up thinking about drinking anymore. Some days, I don't think about it at all. Most days, actually. And when I do, like right now, I can remove myself emotionally from wanting a drink. I don't want one. It all comes down to choice. I've seen the phrase will-power in this thread, and it leads me to believe that people don't have a clear understanding of the AA Program. It clearly states, and I agree, that willpower will not work for the addict. I had to get to a point where I didn't WANT to drink, just like I no longer want to smoke. It's not me depriving myself of something I want. It's me living a better, cleaner, happier, healthier life. &gt;Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. I see these people all the time. And, in my mind, they're not doing it ""right"". I don't feel helpless without the program and I don't feel like I lack control *TODAY*. But if I had a drink, any drink, at any time, I do doubt my ability to stop drinking. I don't want to get into the notion of the disease of addiction. I can only say that once I start drinking, I'm damn near powerless stop. BUT, and this is where I disagree with the program, at least semantically, only I can have the power to not drink. I make that call. No one holds a gun to my head and forces me to drink. It's my choice. It ALL comes down to choice for me. I'm a non-Christian and, I'm not gonna lie, some meetings get really god-heavy. But I've come to realize that I don't know everything, and that a Higher Power can simply mean something bigger than me. When I went to rehab, angry and bitter and knowing everything, I made a friend who was a pretty hardcore Christian. She knew I didn't believe in god, and on our last day she made me a card that said ""It's important to believe in something bigger than us"". And on the inside there was a picture of an elephant and it read ""I believe in elephants"". That was my jumping-off point. The mind of an addict is tricky and twisted. AA, and other programs, give the addict the ability to sort that shit out in a safe, welcoming environment. Did I work all the steps? No. And I don't know if I ever will. But I learned coping mechanisms and insights into myself and the world around me that have allowed me to keep feeding the good wolf, as they say. There are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy sessions and tools that also work. But we can't put everyone in a box. AA works for someone who wants it work. Who embraces that it does come down to choice. I can't say AA is the only thing that's kept me sober. But it's helped a lot. Sorry for the wall of text - my first post in this subreddit. I hope I'm doing it right. EDIT: I forgot to address OP's question about ""solution"" to addiction. In my mind, and the mind of many addicts, there is no cure. It can be arrested, but it will always be there. I will be an addict for life. It's not something I believe can be cured. Just treated."	1
"I'm just going to go ahead and point out that your argument a) is unsupported by any statistical evidence about the efficacy of AA and b) turns on your notion of what constitutes ""healthy"" and ""long term,"" two things which you haven't defined. What to you is a ""healthy"" way to deal with alcoholism, and how is it more ""healthy"" to simply remain a practicing alcoholic when your ""healthy"" prescription doesn't pan out for someone? How long is ""long term?"""	0
American universities spend too much money on their football teams. CMV I saw [this post]( on /r/CFB the other day showing an infographic ([seen here]( about how much American Universities spend to outfit their football teams. Apparently, schools like Auburn University and Ohio State University spend more than $35 million every year to outfit their football teams. The median spending per year on football equipment is $742,000 for NCAA Division 1 schools. I feel like this is an exorbitant amount to spend on a sport, and does not align with the true purpose of a university. Many of these same universities are currently raising tuition on college students, pricing more people out of an education and increasing the debt burden that college students take on. Sure, a private university can go ahead and spend but they want on whatever, but when state universities do so I have a real problem with that. Now, let me clarify that I'm not against sports in college, I just think that universities put too much money into the system. After all, most of that money ends up benefitting athletic outfitters like Nike. And I'm aware that many of these programs are in fact profitable, I just think that those profits should be put back into educational programs, and not into buying more fancy sports equipment. CMV.	1
&gt;And I'm aware that many of these programs are in fact profitable, I just think that those profits should be put back into educational programs, and not into buying more fancy sports equipment. That's not where the money goes though; equipment and training facilities are expensive, of course, but for the most part they're one-off expenses, and the profits more than cover that. [Auburn might have spent more than $39 million, but they brought in more than $76 million.]( So where's the money go? All the other athletics that DON'T make a massive profit, for starters. Auburn has Golf, Track and Field, Hockey, Tennis, Volleyball, Soccer and a whole bunch of other sports that are almost costing more money to maintain than they earn. But because the Football Program is so profitable, the college can easily afford to maintain these extracurriculars for their students to enjoy. As for the leftover money, that obviously goes to the school. But if you or anyone you knew in college ever enjoyed playing any kind of sport on any level (Club, Intramural, Varsity, etc.), know that that option most likely wouldn't have been available if not for the Football (and possibly also the Basketball) Program.	0
Remember that many top athletic programs are paid for by athletic foundations, not the general university fund. This means that athletics are at least partially funded by private alumni donations. In the university I support (SEC school), I make an annual donation to the athletic foundation, not to the general/alumni fund. Our entire athletic program (including facilities) is paid for by private alumni donations and profits from football/basketball. No university funding is required, thus there is no impact on tuition.	1
I think that Obama has very little to do with the NSA/PRISM Scandal and should not be blamed. CMV Most people directly turn against Obama when it comes to PRISM. I feel like other people were much more involved. Everyone just blames everything on him when he barely has anything to do with anything. What about congress? There is a lot more people involved in politics than just the president; everyone always seems to forget that. Compared to congress, Obama doesn't have many options. Prism was signed during the Bush Administration and we never went against what they were doing. I apologize for my poor grammar. English is definitely not my first language.	0
Sure, others might have been involved. Hell, the entire PRISM system might have already been 100% in place when he came to power. There are others responsible for sure, but that is no reason to excuse Obama. The guy campaigned on privacy and civil/constitutional rights issues. He was elected in a wave of outrage against violations under Bush. Now he has the power to stop an egregious violation of said rights and is choosing to defend the violation instead. in doing so, he's a hypocrite, a liar and a traitor to democracy and American ideals.	0
"Obama is by no means innocent in this. ""Campaign Obama"" was very critical of the Bush-era surveillance programs. Even in his 2009 inaugural address, he said ""“As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.” Fast forward to today, and not only has he done nothing to roll back these programs, but has greatly expanded them and actively defends them as necessary tools to ""protect"" us from terrorism etc. “I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience” Although you are correct however that the blame doesn't lay solely with him. - All the congress members that voted for all these controversial acts over the years that got us in this mess, they are all guilty as well IMO. - The senators like Dianne Feinstein and John McCain who were ""in the know"" and totally OK with all of this. - The Judges who should have put a stop to this, but allowed everything to continue on in secret. - The tech/communications companies that bent over backwards to help the government spy on their customers. (Although in all fairness, I don't think they have really had a chance to tell their side of the story yet. I don't think we know at this point exactly how much pressure was put on them by the government to go along with this.) This is what angers and frustrates me more than anything else, is the fact that **so many** of our representatives and public officials were in on this, and kept secret from the public how far the extent of this program is. In my opinion there are a lot of government employees that *at the very least* should be losing their jobs over this."	0
I think the academic elitist views of engineering and other STEM fields in undergrad are justified. Please CMV **Edit 3: ** Thanks everyone! I have had my view changed mostly due to these arguments: (1) that grading is different between STEM and non-STEM with maybe a bit more leniency outside the hard sciences (2) My school is far from representative of everywhere despite being a large mid-tier institution and (3) Philosophy is hard when you dig deep enough. I honestly would like someone to change my view in regard to this because I totally believe that the academic elitist view of many engineers (myself included) is justified based on the difficulty of my classes. I haven't heard much of the same from other STEM majors but I think at this point it's a justified view for them as well. Basically, my view boils down to this: After having taken a number of upper-level social science courses as required non-tech electives (some economics, psychology, philosophy), it is my opinion that non-STEM majors (excluding skill-based arts/music) are much easier and in general require less work to get the same grade. If I were to decide to major in a non-STEM major I think I could be just as if not more successful than nearly everyone in these majors if I wanted to pursue one of them instead. I do not think the same can be said of a non-STEM major switching into engineering. They may be able to make it through the introductory courses but upper level undergraduate sequences of classes like heat and mass balances --&gt; fluid transport --&gt; heat and mass transfer I think would prove nearly impossible for the majority. **Thus, I think I am better than my fellow non-STEM majors academically because I believe I can do everything they can do in addition to being able to do something that they are unable to do.** To me, this is a *very negative* view to possess because I devalue the effort other students. If you can change my view, I would very much appreciate it. I will do my best to reply to all reasonable challenges. Please feel free to ask me for any clarification. Edit: I do not believe that I am more intelligent or that STEM majors are inherently more intelligent that people in other fields. Many of you have made my conscious of the fact that what I believe stems more from the fact that the mid-level university I attend does not seem to have as strict of requirements for non-STEM majors in regard to coursework as it does for STEM majors. I'm certain there are programs out there with excellent non-STEM programs that I would be in way over my head at. I'm going to read this all later when I have a bit more time but I think there a couple people at least that I may want to give deltas to. Thanks everyone. Edit 2: Ok, sorry for the delay! Reading over everything now after having previewed it on my phone.	1
Did it occur to you that you were taking introductory classes? Even if they weren't at the introductory level, some humanities classes are made for students in other programs to take as electives. If you had aced something like critical perspectives or Middle English I'd be more impressed. Also, not all STEM students pick it up as well as you did. I've seen plenty of engineers get their asses handed to the by an English course. I took an elective commerce class where we had to do a group project. My group was mostly engineers and biology majors. Before we handed it in I had to hastily rewrite the whole thing because so much of what the others wrote wasn't even readable.	1
I'd like to point out to all the people here claiming to have gotten an A in calculus despite being a humanities major: chances are that you didn't take the real calculus course. You probably took the elective course offered to students outside engineering, math, physics majors. A good way to determine whether or not this is the case is if you got a reasonable grade before the curve.	0
"[CMV] I think that life is not a journey, the only thing that matters is how much success you have in your life. The only thing I care about in life is the end result. I don't want to fail at something a million times to ""learn"" to do something, I want success now. Each one of those failures only discourages me from trying harder. I can't enjoy failing like some people can. I'm sorry, but my drawings look like garbage, not a stepping stone to a greater me. And don't get me started with my success rate with women. In short, the only thing I really enjoy in life is success. Failure is discomforting, painful, and only serves to remind me of how bad my skills are. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, CMV."	0
"&gt; I can't enjoy failing like some people can. Guess what dude? Nobody in the history of ever has enjoyed failing. By definition it is not the outcome you wanted, and it just plain sucks. But I don't think that's your real problem. If I had to take a guess (and I don't *really* have to, but I will anyway), I'd say that maybe your problem is that you've somehow gotten your sense of self-worth tied into your success or failure. So then every time you fail at something, your mind is all like, ""see, you're totally worthless and you might as well just crawl in a hole and die."" But everything seems awesome when you're succeeding. If, indeed, that is the issue, this is far beyond what a bunch of internet strangers can fix for you. You could try therapy I guess--that seems to be the standard thing that people recommend for issues of this sort. But I'm going to suggest something else, just for the sake of being different. Go practice mindfulness meditation. The whole point of this exercise is *literally* to focus on the journey, and your success at this exercise is determined largely by your ability to stop thinking about whether or not you're winning. It will probably suck less if you can find a group of people to meditate with who will give you feedback. Groups like that tend to be around in lots of areas though."	0
How do you expect to gain success without risking failure? Nobody enjoys failing. The reason people do it is either because they think the end goal is worth it or because they don't percieve themselves as failing. If we look at your examples, the practicing artist either thinks the drawing skill they gain will be worth it, or more likely they simply enjoy drawing in and of itself or think even their worse artworks are something to be proud of. Even men who are succesful with women get rejected more often than not, but they don't care because they know that if they make enough approachs they will be succesful eventually or they actually enjoy talking to women so the activity has more utility beyond sex/relationships.	0
"Obama is the best we could do 2008-2013 and complaining about his presidency is pointless, CMV. I know a lot of people complain about Obama and hate on him, even the fairly ""liberal"" people. However, in the US, realistically, Democrats and Republicans are the only ones that are capable of taking the seat in the Oval Office due our (seemingly) two party system. If Romney or McCain was elected into the office, we would (more than likely) still have the PRISM, NDA, etc. But not only would we have that, we would have strict abortion laws, no progress for gay rights, women's rights, etc. So I'd much rather have a PRISM supporting president that supports equality than one who is a social conservative. Whenever I hear people complain on Reddit about Obama (and the majority Reddit is pro-equality), I always point that out, but get downvoted into oblivion. Please tell me why that is? EDIT: To clarify, I don't mean complain about his actions. complaining about his actions is okay, I mean to complain about him becoming president overall is pointless. UPDATE: A lot of you guys raised a lot of good points. [This post in particular]( changed my view."	1
I think you're looking at the complaints (though not all of them) from the wrong approach. The fact that people feel backed into a one or the other, lesser of two evils choice every four years is enough reason for disdain as is, but it is only compounded by a trend that seems to grow every election; executive or legislative. People are voting for a President or representative and expect them to be their voice in steering the country in the direction the people want. These people get elected, however, and do what **they** see as right. People are complaining about that, not so much the man himself. I never understood why politicians told me how they felt about certain issues. I don't give a shit how they feel, I want someone who will vote, or in the President's case veto/pass, what the majority wants. But they rarely do and people complain. Is the complaining pointless? No. It gets attention. With enough attention change may come about, whether it leads to an internal reform of how things are done, people voting a certain/different way or an all out revolution. Now to address specific complaints toward Obama and the desire to remove him, this goes back to the idea that even though he was elected, he's not living up to the expectations of those who elected him. If I had to buy a car and chose the 'best of what was offered' and ended up with a car that didn't run at all after a week, I'd want a new car. Just because the salesman said it was great doesn't mean it was or that I should be obligated to keep it. tl;dr Complaining isn't pointless, it raises awareness and may lead to change.	0
"First of all, the notion of a ""two party system"" is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If 80% of the popular vote in every state had gone to Jill Stein, she would have become president, unless for some grand unprecedented fixing at the Congressional level (which admittedly could probably happen). Secondly, how do you even know that McCain and Romney would really be as bad as you feared? Everyone *thought* Obama was going to close Guantanamo Bay. Everyone *thought* he was going to pull back the executive powers Bush gave himself. Everyone *thought* he might end the drug war, or at least end the wars overseas. He's been a lot less progressive than we thought, so why do we assume that McCain and Romney would have been just as conservative as we thought? They likely would have been much more moderate as well, if they were actually elected. Thirdly, why does it matter if Romney and McCain would have been worse? If the school cafeteria serves (A) moldy pizza and (B) cold gruel, does that mean the students who eat the gruel don't get to complain about it? We hardly had a say in who the party nominees were, and we're having to live with the cards they dealt us, so why shouldn't we complain? What about people who didn't vote, or voted for a leftist third party? Also, specifically to Reddit, which you mentioned: Reddit was *all about Obama* during the election. Basically every time he came on TV, the front page had 10 posts along the lines of: * Does anyone else have tears in his eyes? Obama clinched his re-election with that speech. * Redditors, how can anyone at this point still support Mitt Romney? * Regardless of your politics, I think we can all agree the Obama family is the cutest first family of all time * Wow. Just wow. Obama just destroyed Romney in that debate. All the while, turning a blind ear to any suggestion that he might not be the Great Progressive Hope of the Universe. So I'm sure a lot of the moaning on Reddit is blowback from that."	0
"I think Dark Souls is the best game ever made and I cant really enjoy any other new games. Please CMV The title says it all, and I understand its rather specific. To me, Dark Souls has the perfect amount of challenge blended with in-depth character development in the most beautiful video game world Ive ever seen. The game doesn't necessarily have the best graphics possible, but the seamless design of the world and the gorgeous views make me say ""wow"" much more than a game like skyrim, farcry 3, bioshock infinite, or last of us does. Since Ive gotten into dark souls I havent been able to really enjoy any other RPG/ adventure games because they simply seem inadequate and childish in comparison to DS. This CMV applies more to new games than old ones, because I certainly still love the games I used to love such as Morrowind, Metroid Prime, Soul Calibur, etc. But dark souls made feel that new games have nothing innovative or redeemable in them. All FPS games seem pretty much the same to me with slight variations, and RPGs seem to just be getting more mainstream and accessible. I would like to get rid of this prejudice, because I really enjoy playing video games, I just haven't found a game I genuinely thought was a masterpiece since I've played dark souls. So please, CMV and maybe suggest some titles you think Id enjoy"	1
Have you looked into roguelikes? Like Brogue, DoomRL, Dungeon Stone Soup, Cataclysm, Dwarf Fortress. Dark Souls design is in part inspired by roguelikes, which also impart a sort deep tension and thrill from the high stakes permadeath. You may also consider that Dark Souls works under a different design philosophy than some other games, that they may seem childish because DS is all about challenge (and the beauty/experience of that), whereas other games will focus more about experience and interaction and just factor difficulty into that. Like for example, one of the most memorable moments in Fallout 3 is first exiting your tiny vault into the real world and your eyes have to adjust to the sunlight for the first time. It's like the game just drops you off into this massive world and is letting you know their is so much to explore and it's further reinforced by how tiny and restricted the vault seemed beforehand. The thrill of that has very little to do with challenge, but is trying to excite you with the concept of interaction instead. So to enjoy different games, you may have to come in with different expectations. Dark Souls is a masterpiece of game design, but is working under a different strategy to excite you than something like Bioshock Infinite, which is more genius in it's commentary on game choice and environment as opposed to difficulty.	0
Have you've ever read a book, or a series of books (like Harry Potter or ASOIAF) and felt depressed when you finished it? When that happens to me, I look on my bookshelf and pick something completely different from what I just read because I know that anything similar wouldn't be enjoyable (such as reading Harry Potter after ASOIAF would be too similar to each other - both are fantasy after all - but rereading Ender's Game wouldn't be too bad). Essentially, you need a rebound game. Something so completely different from Dark Souls that after playing it for a few days and weeks you'll be ready to dive into skyrim or bioshock again, and really enjoy it too! For me, the best games would be Civ 5, Kerbal Space Program, or Surgery Simulator 2013. The last two are so silly that they take the depressing pain away.	1
I believe that Kantian ethics stands as a good guide to live your life by. CMV. Wiki on the topic (sorry, mobile): I see nothing wrong with this theory of ethics. It's based on reason, it's consistent, and strongly supports personal autonomy. I believe that society would be perfect if everyone followed Kantian ethics.	0
"Kantiab Ethics has a few glaring holes IMO. The first is that the idea that, ""an action can be considered good if it can be willed as a universal maxim."" But not everyone will ever agree on a maxim, so they're can never be a universal maxim. For instance, ""Do not kill."" that can easily be considered a universal maxim. And yet there are a thousand reasons &amp; oppositions you can give to that. What if your in war? What if you're defending yourself? What your forced to kill someone? What if your religion tells you to kill someone? Or what if you just enjoy killing people? Another major problem is that in order to create these maxims Kan says we must eliminate all are emotional connections &amp; think purely with reason. This is impossible. Why? Because your very way of thinking is based upon your emotional connections. The things you may consider ""bad"" or ""good"" is based purely upon the ideas that you have formed based upon numerous encounters with friends, family, strangers &amp; the media. It's impossible to divide yourself from this. Kant's perspective from the very start asks too much &amp; is impossible. We are rational creatures, but our rationality of what is ethical comes from what our environment has told us is ethical, &amp; no one can every agree on a universal maxim, so there by definition is no ""universal"" maxim"	0
Well Kantian ethics is ridiculous. Either you take it very literally, in which case you're not allowed to be consequentialist. So you can't lie to the Nazi officer who wants to know if you're sheltering any jews. Or, you make mini situation specific categorical imperatives, so, everyone should always lie when a nazi officer comes to the door and asks if there is a jewish man in your house. Problem with this is, it's tautologous, all it's saying is that in every situation do the right thing. It's not helpful, really it's just the doctrine of double effect/consequentialism framed really unhelpfully.	0
I don't think it's wrong for a girl to be slutty and promiscuous provided that she practises safe sex and birth control. CMV I don't see why women that have lots of sex (usually not with the same person) are looked down upon. Sex is something that all enjoy and that can be simply practiced for pleasure. As long as she or her partner use a condom,and she isn't cheating / sleeping with a person already in a relationship, I really don't see the problem.	0
A problem is that use of a condom is risk management, it doesn't remove risk. All the risks that are present without condoms are still present with them, just to a lesser extent. So, promiscuity is a potential health hazard, even with safe sex. Additionally, it's easy to wind up with different goals with sex partners, people who initially wanted no strings attached can wind up unintentionally attached. These things have a nasty tendency to explode socially, which makes them rather disruptive. It might work out just fine the vast majority of the time, but it only requires a couple of situations to end in shouting matches, broken friendships, feuds, or cases of stalking for the community to have a serious problem. A strong selection process can carefully manage these issues to the point where I would argue that someone could successfully do so an not be socially disruptive or a vector for disease. The problem is this is at loggerheads with the goal of having lots of sex, either one limits sex in one a variety of ways and reaches a balance with society at large or one does not limit sex and does provoke social pressure to do so. Guys who do likewise are also looked down upon, largely for the same reason. It's just not as pronounced because of a biased cultural inheritance. So it's not something all that gender specific.	0
Wrong or not, here is a friend's (#1) experience with another slutty female friend (#2): * Friend #2 is slutty, so brings a different date to each event. Requiring friend #1 to constantly interact with new people at parties/events where it is supposed to be close friends only * Friend #2 is slutty, so sleeps with other male friends of female friend #1, forcing situation where friend #1 must 'Choose sides' and ruined friendship with the guy friend, who she really liked. * Friend #2 is never available to do things as a 'couple' with friend #1 who is in a committed relationship, because friend #2, is never in a relationship. * Every evening spent with friend #2 becomes about her dating life. This is normal in female friendships, when one member of a group has a new relationship. But, because friend #2, is *always* in the throes of a new relationship/partner, she manipulates the groups 'new relationship' time. and causes drama. Like the time when she had to use emergency contraceptives. OR the guy turned crazy. * Going out for a 'girls night' ends up with #2 hooking up with someone, leaving friend #1 to go home early, or be alone. * Women also often don't trust promiscuous women to be around their own partners. Its why 'slutty' girls only hang out with other 'slutty' girls. And why girls in long term, committed relationships i.e.e 'nice girls', don't enjoy spending time with 'slutty' girls. So, while I wouldn't argue that its **wrong** (because right and wrong are so vague, anyways), I would say it is socially unacceptable, and that these are some examples of why. I would also like to point out, that I think it has *nothing* to do with jealousy. I think it is about preserving social structure.	0
I believe that the media has a liberal bias CMV Everyone is biased one way or another. I don't believe that either the left or right side of politics is completely right - I'm not claiming that they are equal - just that when you are in a bubble it is easy to not understand the other side's point of view. Now, I believe that journalists, despite their best efforts, will exhibit some degree of bias too. This will lead to the majority of the media having a liberal bias, since most journalists are [liberal]( Of course, some outlets (Fox news) have a heavy conservative bias. I'm not claiming that the liberal bias is anywhere near as large as many conservatives would have you believe, just that it exists	0
"Did you ever consider that the news is biased but not in a left/right way? There's a ""sensationalism bias"" where news outlets try to find news that is exciting while ignoring important, yet mundane or complex stories. There's a ""pander to your audience"" bias, where news organizations try to please their audience rather than educate them. There's a ""pre existing narrative"" bias where news organizations alter stories to fit what most people believe or want to believe. There's a ""don't upset our sponsor"" bias where news organizations will ignore or downplay stories which cast their advertisers in a bad light. Sure some outlets are explicitly liberal or conservative but IMO these are the bigger forms of media bias."	0
Your source doesn't exactly seem that neutral on this subject, and I'm having a hard time finding numbers on this that aren't from a conservative/Republican source. But I also have a question: what differences are there in the way a liberal bias manifests versus a conservative one? I ask because other than MSNBC and the much larger FOX, I don't see that many that aren't a blog or somesuch, where the bias is blatant. How many are simply a more-or-less neutral outlet that one might read a scattered article and detect some kind of bias one way or the other? by what metric do you decide an entire outlet or journalist to be biased as opposed to the assemblage of facts on a single article?	0
"Here's what I would change about American gun regulations. CMV Stipulated: improving the way we regulate guns is not the only way to reduce the frequency at which we're violently killing each other. But it is **a** way. Let me also say that I'm reasonably sure that *something* needs to change about the way the 2nd Amendment is viewed. I'm less sure about exactly what should be done. Here is what comes to my mind. I may not be able to defend these ideas in much detail, and I'm interested in the community's thoughts. I mainly wished to argue ([as I did in another CMV]( that **something** needs doing. Indeed, if you don't agree that there is a need for more regulations or increased enforcement, or if you feel that it would be unconstitutional to do as I recommend, then we should discuss it in that other CMV. But I was [pressed]( for specifics, so these are some of the possibilities I think are reasonable. Please tell me what you think of these, and tell me what else you would like the government to do. 1. If you aren't properly licensed, you can't own or possess a gun. Getting a license means demonstrating some kind of proficiency related to safely and responsibly storing and using the weapon. Like a driver's license. And like a driver's license, demonstrating increased levels of proficiency and responsibility means you can own more (and more destructive) weapons, or even carry them in public. I'm not reflexively opposed to private ownership of, say, semiautomatic handguns, assault weapons or large magazines. But I'd like owners of those kinds of weapons to undergo frequent and intrusive recertifications, with the intrusiveness and frequency tied to the lethality of the weapons/magazines. 2. Getting a license involves background checks and some kind of mental health evaluation. The more significant the license, the deeper the checks. 3. You can't buy or own ammunition without a license. Maybe there should be restrictions or bans on especially destructive ammo. 4. I've heard suggestions of an exorbitant tax on ammunition. CMV, but I don't see how that helps. 5. If you are in possession of a firearm, you need to be able to demonstrate that you acquired it legally and are properly licensed. Just like a car. ""License and registration please."" 6. All firearms must be traceable. You can't sell a firearm except to someone licensed to own it. All firearms must be individually identifiable, and all firearms sales must be recorded and tracked. Just like a car. 7. You have to display your license to be ~~admitted to~~ served at such places as firing ranges, gun stores and gun shows. 8. If a firearm is used in a crime or is found in the wrong hands, the weapon's registered owner must be held to account. If you lost it or it was stolen from you, your license is suspended, downgraded or revoked because ipso facto you didn't meet your responsibility for safeguarding it. 9. The BATF and other enforcement agencies have to be funded and empowered to enforce these and other regulations nationwide so weaknesses in one state don't lead to a flow of weapons elsewhere. And a national database will, of course be required. EDIT: converted bullets to numbers for readability with /u/JOberlander's response."	1
"Interestingly enough, they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago. It all seems logical and practical and like it should work. Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all. So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns. Then it was shotguns only. Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar. Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated. Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control. So what was the critical difference? As was pointed out, it's that your argument pre-supposes that firearms are a priviledge and not a right. You go into the creation of the list with a view that logically will lead you down this path. But let's get into each statement/idea. Because some are good, and some are not. And this isn't really abot how you set up the argument so much as the individual points. 1 - This sounds great. But this is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits. A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits (it's a hodge-podge of conflicting laws currently and some states accept others, some do not), Also, make a concerted effort to promote such permit ownership to our youths (say, training leading up to a full permit at adulthood) and as part of self-defense programs and so on. We need more firearms in the hands of good, trained citizens. 2 - Absolutely. We do this in California already to buy any firearm. But the issue again is every state has its own rules and laws. There needs to be one database and one standard for all states. I know I'm a big proponent of States rights, but in many ways, the patchwork of laws creates more headache that it's worth when we're trying to tackle a natiowide problem. 3 - Unfortunately this is completely unworkable. Given that you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands, it's never going to happen. 4 - Correct. People will just load their own or drive across town to where it's not taxed. TO make this work, it would have to be one law for the entire U.S. But then there's issues with unfair taxes vs states rights and that would simply take decades to deal with in the courts. Federal regulations are one thing, but adding an ""ammo tax"" which it would be called, is a political quagmire. 5 - We already do this with CCW permits. The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person. This also needs to be cleaned up at the Federal level. A higher level permit as you suggest would possibly let you carry in such paces, like bounty hunters and guards do. Promote this as possibly some sort of deputy corps to help out the overworked police. 6 - They already do this in most states. The issue is... wait for it... the states that don't. 7 - Unworkable, really. 8 - This is almost the law in some states already. I see no issue with it, really. As a firearm owner, your responsibility to secure it is exactly that. Fines should seem appropriate. But then again, if they steal your entire safe, it shouldn't be entirely your fault. 9 - Lastly, this is a must. A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights. When you left it up to every city and state to have different laws about voting rights, laws, police enforcement, and so on, it was a social and emotional nightmare. Only when you made it one law for everyone did we get compliance and the start of a workable system."	1
"I don't see any reason not to institute mandatory background checks (which red flags from the background check would make you ineligible is another issue) or institute some sort of gun license so long as the fee is not exorbitant and the process for applying for the license is not too difficult or restrictive. However, the mental health evaluation you suggest sounds like it would have more room for abuse and would have a tendency to be expensive for the potential gun owner (if you're thinking about an appointment with a certified psychologist). Paperwork demonstrating transfer of ownership, similar to what we do for cars, also sounds like a good idea. I don't think a gun owner should be held accountable if one of their guns is stolen and used in a crime any more than a car owner would be held accountable if their car were stolen and then used in a crime. However, as with cars, if you fail to properly transfer ownership of a gun and that gun is used in a crime, there should probably be some consequences for you, though obviously not as severe as for the person who actually perpetrated the crime. I don't think that owners of ""semiautomatic handguns, assault weapons or large magazines"" should be subject to ""frequent and intrusive recertifications."" The license/background check, if we instituted one, should be the same as for a hunting rifle. I could be convinced otherwise if research showed that semiautomatic handguns, etc. were more likely to be involved in a violent crimes, accidents, and/or suicides than hunting rifles and shotguns, but as far as I know, such data does not exist for the US--in large part because the NRA keeps shooting itself in the foot (ha!) by blocking the funding of organizations that want to do this kind of research. I seem to remember a post recently with data from another country (Australia maybe?) showing that deaths caused by assault weapons, etc. were negligible compared to deaths caused by hunting rifles and shotguns. The only gun I own is a semi-automatic .22 caliber handgun with a 10-shot magazine that I won in a raffle when I was 16 (I didn't technically own it until I turned 21--my father did). I enjoy shooting targets with my dad, but it's not my favorite thing in the world. I do not believe that my .22 ""semi-automatic"" weapon makes me a dangerous person. I also do not believe it will help me stand up against a totalitarian government (nor do I fear the US turning into such a government in my lifetime). However, I would like to keep it and would rather not pay several hundred dollars for a license or undergo rigorous psychiatric examination in order to maintain ownership of my property. If reliable research showed that my type of gun was 10 times more likely to be involved in a violent crime than a hunting rifle, then I would reluctantly deal with the new regulations or (more likely) sell my gun to someone who was willing to deal with the regulations. I wouldn't raise much of a fuss because I like reading and Reddit more than shooting. But my father would be very upset since his primary hobbies do involve guns, and it would make me sad to see him go through the type of bureaucracy that you propose, especially without a reasonable demonstration beforehand that the changes would actually result in a reduction of gun violence. Again, I think the NRA is more to blame for the lack of research we have than anyone else. Stop the NRA from continuing their shenanigans, present me with some cold, hard facts or reasonable projections, and my views could change significantly."	1
(US) I think voting should be compulsory. CMV. While I understand the irony of being forced to participate in a democratic system, I think that voting should be compulsory in the US. With a compulsory system, we could get a better idea of what EVERYONE thinks, (not just those that show up now, which are mostly ideologues on either side) and possibly get people that represent more of America, instead of polarizing politicians from the left and right. Of course, we would have to make it easier to vote in order to compensate for this policy: like moving election days to Saturdays instead of Tuesdays, or making election days national holidays, giving people pizza, whatever works. PS: I'm a total leftist, but I think we need more than left wing politicians in order for a healthy democracy to exist.	0
Making voting compulsory is a ridiculous idea for two reasons. Firstly, it would be monstrously expensive to enforce such a law. I have no idea how you'd even do it in the first place, and even if a system were devised, I have no interest in supporting such a thing with my taxes. Of course, the more pressing issue is that many people simply don't care (a topic for another CMV perhaps), and their votes would skew the election. For example, a decent fraction of the country votes in the presidential election because even if you don't take a particularly active interest in the candidates, you hear enough through news outlets, social media, and word of mouth to develop an opinion. The legitimacy of the information you receive is questionable, but you at least know something about each candidate and you use this information to make a decision. On the off chance that this information doesn't intrigue you, you make the decision to not vote at all, and the election can be decided by people who do care. By the way, the right to vote, just like freedom of religion, should certainly include the right to not vote just as a person can choose to not follow a religion. What about senatorial elections though? Do you even know who your representatives are for the state you live in? Most people don't and forcing those people to vote in an election involving politicians they know nothing about is an awful idea because their votes will essentially be probabilistic noise. Between two candidates, the uninformed voters will split 50/50 thus diluting the voters whom actually care. Should we be more involved in our voting system in this country? Sure, but forcing people to do so is not the solution.	0
"As someone else already noted, you'll have (well, we already have) nutbirds who know nothing but vote anyway. So many people vote for the ""nicest dude"" or the person with the most campaign signs and have no idea about any of this person's proposed policies or stances. Also, people who really didn't want to vote could just write ""Billy Goat"" in the write-in section, and therefore they haven't really voted... What I think we should do is severely limit campaign time and money and eliminate political parties. For example, candidates only start running a month before the election. They have a few debates and clearly outline their policies and stances. There are several candidates to choose from, and hopefully people will have to do (at least a miniscule amount of) research before choosing who to vote for)."	0
"I don't think ""safe spaces"" are a good idea. CMV Let me clarify a bit. If a group is suffering physical abuse, then by all means, they should have a chance to speak openly without fear of retaliation. But that does not mean that you should stay within your little circle and refuse to listen to differing opinions. It can be beneficial to share with like-minded people, but I'm of the opinion that discussing with those who hold opposite view points is a much more beneficial exercise. For me at least, any of my beliefs are always open to challenge. I don't feel the need to reinforce my ideas with a circlejerk - I'm confident in my ideals and I'm willing to argue them. If I *can't* argue one of my beliefs, then it needs to be reconsidered. Therefore, I think safe spaces, where only those of a certain group are allowed to speak, are more often harmful than helpful. CMV"	0
Safe spaces aren't really created to hide people from other view points, after all, almost all of the people in these groups have to adjust to and communicate with people who have opinions other than their own in their everyday lives. There are a couple reasons why safe spaces can be very beneficial. Here are a few that I can think of off the top of my head. 1)Many of the people in these groups actually *have* either experience physical or emotional abuse as well as loss of jobs, relationships with family/friends, and social status, or been threatened with it. For instance, my university has a confidential program (safe space) for people who think they might be LGBT but are questioning or can't come out for various often times very serious reasons. The people who go to that group are already in an emotionally and socially vulnerable position in which speaking up in front of people who oppose them could be not only absolutely traumatizing in itself, but also potentially life devastating. On this same train of thought, many groups have such a history of being oppressed or abused by another group that this fear becomes omnipresent even when an individual has not been *openly and directly* threatened or abused. For instance, [this study]( shows that women are 75% less likely to speak up in a space when outnumbered by men. This means that bringing men, especially men who might vehemently disagree with what they are saying, into a safe space means for all intents and purposes shutting the women in the group up. 2)The purpose of most safe spaces is not form a space that people spend all of their time lingering in and closing off from the world, but rather to find a group of other people who share common experiences who can give you advice, comfort, and reassurance. By the way, it is not only safe spaces that do this, but many different types of groups. It would be inappropriate to waltz into a church during services and proclaim why their religion is wrong, or walking into a sports bar during the Superbowl trying to tell people that sports are stupid and a waste of time. When people come together over a common interest/experience they are looking to find enjoyment and camaraderie, not to argue. Just because people participate in these type of group events doesn't mean that the church goer or sports fan wouldn't be open to other viewpoints at another time; it simply means that in this one event or space they are not looking to battle their views out with another. Likewise, people who participate in safe spaces are still open to discussion in other circumstances, but want the occasional comfort of and support of a group who understands them. After all, most members of safe space groups live in societies which are not as receptive/encouraging of their views every day, so it isn't as though they are hiding from the world entirely. 3) Most of the rules and guidelines that define safe spaces are just to get people who typically feel shut down in normal conversations/debates for their views/sexuality/race/gender/whatever are able to express their viewpoint. Many people that I know are comfortable in their beliefs about something, but are too shy, insecure, fearful of being ostracized to be able to argue them to others, but they still need some outlet for their thoughts/feelings. Whilst I think you and I both likely best communicate and explore our ideas through debate, some people can't because they feel attacked through this method of discourse, especially people who are members of groups who have been/are being systematically dismissed in society. Participating in a safe space gives those people the cathartic opportunity to say how they think/feel and hopefully even gain enough confidence through the encouragement of the group to express their views in the more public way you desire. In this way, **safe spaces can actually be beneficial to the creation of meaningful dialog**. I hope that helps a little :)	0
Our society is geared towards white men. Part of that gearing is that their ideas and opinions are celebrated and encouraged, and as a consequence others might feel uncomfortable sharing their ideas and opinions in spaces dominated by straight white men. You can observe this phenomenon yourself! Are you in school, university, or employed with a wide variety of people? Observe how often women and people of color speak up - particularly in spaces where they are a) new and/or b) in a numerical minority. I'm willing to bet it's significantly less than the white dudes speak up. The other consequence of this, of course, is that if there's a straight white male opinion on an issue you better fucking believe *everyone* has heard it, because the straight while male opinions are the mainstream opinions. They're the op eds in your newspapers, they're the SCOTUS decisions, they're the authors of your magazine articles, etc. Sometimes it's nice to have a space where this particular viewpoint isn't belabored past the point where it's useful. Finally, 'safe spaces' can also foster a discussion between a group of people who are all on the same page. No movement would ever get anywhere if it had the first hour of any given meeting trying to explain its core tenets to newcomers. If I want to hash out the specifics of intersectional feminism, I am most likely to accomplish that goal with a group of intersectional feminists. I *ought*, if I'm a good intersectional feminist, to have a good logical justification for intersectional feminism in general, but sometimes I don't want to have to *give* that justification every time I talk about it.	0
I believe in equal-opportunity meritocracy, but I also think winners use their power to cheat and lock in advantages. The solution is to reset opportunity by seizing and redistributing wealth every 50 years so the winners have to keep proving themselves. CMV Cheating methods include: test prep, prep schools, legacy admissions, gifts to schools, inheritance, nepotism, racism. Let's put a stop to all this so we live up to the ideal of equal opportunity. I know how disruptive a 50 year reset would be, but I think if the winners really deserve their status they can handle it. They will naturally rise to the top after each reset and so much room will be made for disruptive innovation that any society that does this will soar ahead of those that don’t. Note that I don't want to dismantle firms, just redistribute ownership. I can imagine how hard this would be to implement, especially if it could not be done globally, but I think it’s a worthwhile goal because everyone needs to feel they live in a true meritocracy instead of a corrupt system. Maybe a constitutional convention would make it happen? Forms of wealth to redistribute continuously over time: education, food, health care, &amp; traditional public goods like water, roads, justice, etc. Forms of wealth to seize and redistribute every 50 years: money, land, valuable contracts, stocks, bonds, futures, derivatives, and other financial instruments. Forms of wealth that can’t be redistributed: innate intelligence, sociability, creativity, drive. These are the things winners should be judged on. It takes a little communism to keep capitalism working... unless I'm wrong.	0
It doesn't work because of game theory. There's a famous game called the Prisoner's Dilemma (which reflects lots of real-world situations), in which you have two people. Each person benefits from being cooperated with, the benefit from not cooperating with the other person, and both people benefit more from both cooperating than from both not cooperating. In order for people to cooperate when they can't make binding agreements, they have to have the reason of trying to get their partner to cooperate in a future iteration of the game. There's a proof of this; the best way to play the Prisoner's Dilemma is to start by cooperating, and then do whatever your partner did last time. However, this breaks down if you know exactly how long the game is going to run. In the final iteration, neither person has any incentive to cooperate (since there are no more future iterations to influence), so they will both not cooperate. Since this outcome can't be changed, there's no reason to cooperate in the next-to-last round, therefore there's no reason to cooperate in the third-to-last, and so on all the way back to the first round. To avoid that problem, you need to make the resets based on something random, and make them happen suddenly.	0
This could work only if you could keep the reset a secret. If it *isn't* a secret you've massively, catastrophically, distorted economic incentives. Lets list a few examples: 1. At some point, a few years or less before the reset all the most productive members of society *stop working*. Why? Because they've saved enough to live off of the next few years and there is zero reason for them to work for money they'll just have to give up. 2. At the same time the demands for a certain class of goods go through the roof: any thing that is consumed in the short term but has long term dividends. *Everyone* wants to go to school, get training, or go on vacation. *No one* wants to teach classes, do training or serve people on vacation. This is basically a mega great-depression. 3. Have an idea for a new technology that could change the world? Is it something you could reasonably expect to profit from for more than the next decade and that no one is likely to beat you to? Then keep it a secret until just after the reset. No major technological innovations for the years leading up to the reset will nicely contribute to the biggest recession the world has even seen. 4. Farmer? In normal times you've been rotating crops to keep from over farming. Logger? Are you planting new trees to replace what you're growing down? Have you been keeping that stream clear for your grandchildren to enjoy? Screw it: the land is about to be someone else's: time to make a quick buck by using it as a chemical waste dump. 5. Want a loan or capital of any kind to start a business? I can't imagine why since you'll lose everything you make. But even if you did: you won't be able to get it. No one is going to loan you money they won't get back. No one is going to stay invested in your company when they can spend the dough on caviar and hookers. Now, add one more thing: this proposal is *less* politically feasible than making all hiring and admissions blind. I don't think getting rid of inheritance is a good idea (similar screwing with incentives): but it is certainly easier than your plan. And doing things like that doesn't create these perverse incentives.	0
"I think religious people are incapable of logical thought, CMV I am a climatologist and since I started my job at USDA about a year ago, I've run into two types of people who make my life a living hell: * There are government employees from federal and state agencies who deny climate change because ""man doesn't have that much control over god's creations"". * Even worse, there are some who say they simply don't care what happens on earth because it's only ""the first step"" of their eternal lives. They plan on being dead and in heaven, and whatever happens here on Earth is inconsequential. When I run into kinds of colleagues, I try to explain to them the science of what's happening. However, their responses ultimately lead them to some sort of anomalous thought patterns where their logic clearly breaks down, and science doesn't matter. **I believe religious people at some point in their thought processes are not capable of logic, or choose to believe things their scientific minds tell them is clearly false.** **CMV.**"	1
"They are using logic, but they take other things as axiomatic. ""A fish doesn't understand the concept of water"" might be analogous. 300 years ago it was taken for granted that witches cause disease, so when a couple of villagers came down with the same symptoms everyone took it for granted that they have to find the witch and burn her to solve the problem. From their point of view, it was as logical as someone today concluding that they have a dead battery if their car won't turn over. Ah crap, time to find someone who can give me a jump. When people accept religious concepts as deep and immutable facts it's just like growing up and taking oxygen for granted. Of course God exists, he made the Earth and everything on it, and he said he wasn't going to fuck around with the climate after the Great Flood. 2 + 2 = 4. It's _that_ logical to them. It's the [allegory of the cave]( Whereas modern science fills libraries, and it's not everyone's priority to read it all, even if they could. The concept that I think matters is [processing fluency]( how easy it is to ""think"" in a particular model. If you understand Calculus thoroughly it can be easier to ""think in calculus"". Or think in statistics, or think in orbital mechanics (you have to slow down to get to your destination faster--woah, that's not intuitive!) Or take the video game _Portal_ and one of it's catchprhases, ""now you're _thinking_ in portals."" Once you _get it_ you take off like a rocket, but until then you flail around because your brain just hasn't reconfigured itself yet. You aren't ""thinking in physics"" or ""thinking in thermodynamics"" yet and can't see how climate change can work. It's not unreasonable, however, to resist an idea just because you can't ""think in fluid dynamics"" or something else that's relevant. How do they know it matters? How can they know what it's like if they don't think in that paradigm, yet? There are lots of ways to think about the world, and we all have a natural tendency to resist new models for good reason: they're wrong more often than they're right. Could I think in the models that make some horrible social injustice seem right? I probably could. For shits and giggles I could imagine what it's like to think in a model where homosexuality is unnatural and harmful and understand why someone would be opposed to marriage equality. I can also think in a different model, where gay marriage is harmless. But if you're not already well versed in both, it can be as hard to ""think in arbitrary sexuality"" as it is to think in the unintuitive world of orbital mechanics, where going faster means you go slower. Religious people think they are thinking logically, and the way to change them is to educate them gently, and without any hostility. We must find ways to let them explore physical models that aren't obvious, just like giving a child toys to play with in the bathtub so they begin to get a grip on basic fluid mechanics."	0
"Based on your story, I think your claim is a bit strong. First, you need to qualify it with ""The religious people I work with ..."" Second, do you honestly think they are *incapable* of logical thought? Surely its possible that they just haven't learned about basic logic and various logical fallacies. These things can be learned. So instead of saying ""incapable of"" you should probably change that to ""don't understand."" And even then, surely your religious co-workers have at least an intuitive understanding that ""A is B"" and ""A is not B"" are mutually exclusive. And they surely have an intuitive understanding of basic logic like *modus ponens.* They may not always apply it correctly in daily life, but most people are at least capable of understanding these concepts. But they probably don't understand advanced logic concepts like modal logic (most people don't). So at the most you can say the don't understand *some* logical thought. Based on that, I think the strongest claim you can make is the following: **""The religious people I work with don't understand and apply to their life some logical concepts.""**"	0
"Disgusted by their antics, I will never vote Republican. CMV Aside from maybe dogcatcher, Republicans' political antics and many of their policy stances have disgusted me to the point where I can scarcely consider voting for them even a hypothetical option. * I consider the Shutdown and earlier budgetary show-downs to be exceedingly irresponsible of the Republicans, a party that likes to claim the mantle of responsibility. * I find it callous that the GOP claims the debt and reducing the size of government are the highest priority when their efforts directly hurt people already suffering in a period of slow job recovery. * The GOP's strong ties to the Religious Right are anathema to me. I am an atheist, and I support a scientifically informed view on public policy. Pushing things like prayer in schools, ""intelligent design,"" denying climate change, restrictive sexual mores, and the notion that the United States is a ""Christian nation"" turn me off. * I am not a fan of gun violence (okay, well, who could disagree with that?). I believe we can find reasonable safeguards to reduce the rate of gun violence and number of guns while preserving 2nd Amendment rights. I understand gun culture and hunting are a major part of the rural lifestyle in America, but in urban areas, we associate guns more with crime and murder. * The Republicans like to talk the talk about civil liberties, but I don't think John McCain or Mitt Romney would have done things much differently from Obama in regard to NSA surveillance and other aspects of security theater. * I think we spend too much on the military and rather that money be spent on a social welfare: infrastructure, education, research."	1
The Republican Party was the one that freed the slaves. The ideas and the goals of the parties change. Saying that you will never vote for another party You've also removed part of the need for the Republican party to change. They now know they will never get your vote, so why try to change in a way that would have gotten your vote? Let's use you're NSA example. What if you knew that, 100% guaranteed, the next Republican President would end domestic spying? And while he was at it he fixed poverty, crime, and accomplished world peace? An extreme but you get the idea. You've pledged to never vote republican, so it doesn't matter. Vote on the issue, not on what party they align with.	0
"Never say never. 15 or 20 years from now there could be a whole new crew in charge of the party that takes the party in a much more favorable direction. They will never try to turn their act around if they will never get your vote (or the vote of others who think like you). But if you say ""I don't like what you guys have been doing lately, but if you change your ways by doing X, Y, and Z then maybe I will vote for you in the future."" then they have a motivation to take those action to try and secure your vote for the future. Don't polarize politics more than you have to, make the parties compete with each other for your vote."	0
I think beards are disgusting. CMV I have friends who have huge beards that they're incredibly proud of, and every time I see them I think it's just gross. Whether the well-groomed, short type or the long lumberjack-y growth, beyond the stubble stage it's all kind of weird to me. Nothing about them seems manly or rugged. I've heard a variety of responses to my view - some agree, some think that I'm going against some unspoken tenet of manliness. I've been most surprised to hear women that find unkempt, large beards attractive. I'm a man and I can't imagine doing it. I've bypassed the stubble stage into light beard territory before but I always reach a point where I start being bothered by it. What's so great about it? Why are people attracted to them? Why do people want to grow them? CMV.	1
"I just see it as part of your hairstyle. It's just part of the hair that grows on your head, man. Growing a beard (or rather, not shaving it off) is no less weird than deciding how long, or what style you like the rest of your hair. I guess there is also a lot to be said about how our culture has decided that shaving is the standard, and therefor, when you stop shaving you have suddenly ""started growing"" a beard, as if you weren't already doing that, but I'm not articulate or smart enough to really dig into that. Does the reason you dislike beards have something to do with seeing them as somehow *different* than other hair? Overall, I don't think it is really about people *liking* or *disliking* beards. I think it's more that they just don't mind them."	0
"1. My face looks better with a beard. That is a matter of preference. 2. Initially I started because I was too lazy to shave, then I got used to having facial hair, then it felt weird without any facial hair. 3. I also dont like long gandalf style beards, I dont think most people do, but a well-groomed, short beard looks nice on most people. There is nothing gross about it, unless there are food particles and/or dead things in there, it shouldn't elicit a 'gross' response. 4. A lot of time insecurities about beards stem from ones own incapability of growing a proper beard. I don't know, maybe its a subconscious dislike of beards since you don't like your own. 4. Also there is the common stigma of beards being associated with pride and ""manliness"" in some cases its true as men are the only ones that can grow beards, but most of the time its not a primary reason for having a beard."	1
"CMV - I believe that the crimes committed by the Nazis, even though they were terrible, are a display of human nature First off I do not in any way think that the crimes were OK or justifiable in any way. What I do think though is that crimes like these are a perfect display of the human nature in it's most basic state. IMO it is natural for humans to be brutal and ""barbaric"". And that human kind as a total will probably never (or at least not in a long time) stray from the path of violence and brutality to a path of kindness and fairness because it is just a natural trait of humans to be brutal. Good examples to this are actually all the wars that have ever been fought. Sure sometimes you have to stand up against something but still a lot of situations could just be solved without using force or without starting a war yet humanity continues to choose force and war over peace and diplomacy. EDIT: I think I have messed up my formulation a bit. What I meant to say is following: A lot of people view what the Nazis did pre as well as during WW2 as inhuman and atrocious. I think that even if they are horrible things they are normal and give a good view of how humans as a species are. Or in other words humans are by definition and nature brutal and tend to be so. (Sorry somehow my English skills are just giving up on me -.-) **EDIT 2 (10.10.13 / 19:20 GMT+1):** I will take a look at your posts when I am back on my computer. To say it some things did make me start to rethink my views. Thanks for your replies so far :) CMV :)"	0
"I have thought **a lot** about this topic. I live in germany, so by default I have been confronted with the topic in school many times. History was my strongest class. I then studied social sciences and after graduating have been studying a lot of neuroscientific literature and studies. Humans are not brutal by nature, we are very complex beings. Our brains are incredibly adaptive to our surroundings and experiences and *most* of all to our culture. The crimes commited in the concentration camps were commited under circumstances specifally designed to make them possible. Even the genocide in ruanda (which seems a lot more ""spontaneous"" on first glance) had very complex historical backgrounds and was incited very deliberately. I would argue the contrary: Humans are benevolent and social creatures, that are very capable of violence. Think about it. You are less likely to die of violence today, than ever before, why? Because we built our societies in ways that prevent violence more and more. Are we having setbacks? Of course! Thousands of years ago, we had to use a lot more violence to survive. Hunt animals down and kill them, defend them against other humans (not brutal humans, *hungry* humans). But we always made our best efforts, to make everything safer and safer. We rebuilt and tried to make it better. And can you argue against the fact, that we have the most comfortable live (on average) today, than any generation before us? Why? Because we are brutal and uncivilzed? That does not make sense."	1
Of course the nazi's behaviour is a display of human natural behaviour as they were, in fact, human. Anything done by humans is human nature. Which is to say, humanity's nature is to be extremely plastic. It can be capable of horrifying violence or extremely pacifistic. It can be capable of incredible destruction to a scale not seen by any other living organism in the same way it can choose to be protective of other beings that would have no chance of survival without it's presence. Saying that humans are by defintion brutal, just because of this, is quite shortsighted.	0
I believe the criticism of Twilight is just thinly veiled misogynysm CMV The level of derision heaped on Twilight has little to do with the actual quality of the films or books and a lot to do with men not being able to cope with the fact that there is a successful franchise aimed at women. Worse still at young women. And don't get us started on Twilight moms. Lets slag them off in the queue for Man of Steel or Iron Man 3. Worse still is the patronising argument that Twilight is a bad influence on young women. This no doubt made by the same people who would have a spasm if you suggested that Video games have a deleterious affect on young men. Young women are quite capable of recognising the distinction between fact and fiction. I can offer no evidence as this is my opinion but what set me thinking was [this]( piece in The Guardian. Edit: View changed	0
I'm a woman, and I'm very critical of Twilight because the writing is horrible. In addition to the bad writing, it's a thinly-veiled pro-life parable that encourages young women to be weak and submissive. In comparison, The Hunger Games is well written and features a strong female character. You don't see nearly as much vitriol directed at this series, in spite of the fact that they are aimed at similar audiences. I attribute this to the fact that the writing is much better and the lead is powerful, talented, and smart all on her own. She isn't reliant upon a man to provide her with self worth. She's not chasing the men around, begging for their affection, and trying to kill herself because she is rebuffed. She's a self-assured badass. When you say that young women are able to tell fact from fiction, I agree. This is not the problem with Twilight. The problem is that it acts as an agent of socialization. Young women internalize the idea that loving someone means being submissive, devoted to the point of self-destruction. It's a dangerous concept for young women to internalize, just as it's dangerous for young men to think it's okay to treat women as sex objects without feelings. As a society, we discourage our young people from viewing certain behaviors in a positive light through negative sanctions, and I think that's what's happening here. I also hated The Da Vinci code because the writing was atrocious. Same with 50 shades of gray. There is a lot of bad prose out there.	0
If that were true, we would expect similar levels of vitriol aimed at other media aimed at girls and women wouldn't we? And yet we don't see that level of criticism aimed at things like My Little Pony, which has a very vocal 'brony' community that watches it. And Legend of Korra, which stars a teenage girl and is set in a world that builds upon the one created in TLA, which was also filled with well written and developed female characters. Same with Orange is the New Black, which is almost entirely about women. If it was chiefly misogyny that was causing the hate for twilight, we would naturally assume that the misogyny fueling criticism of twilight would result in criticism of those other fictions. And it's because the examples I listed are all well written. Twilight is hated because it's poorly written and has had far too much success given how poorly written it is. The article you linked mentions movies that, in her opinion, are similarly bad with the target genders reversed like Cowboys and Aliens, but I don't think those are comparable. CnA for example, didn't do that well in theaters and was not the huge phenomenon that Twilight was, and while the premise was silly, the execution of the premise wasn't *that* bad. Meanwhile, Twilight started with a premise that could have worked, but it had terrible writing. It's not misogyny, it's that the more successful something is, the more intense the criticism of it will be if it's generally perceived to be stupid. Look at Cars and Car 2 by Pixar. Most people agree that they're some of Pixar's worst movies. (They're not terrible - they're just not as good) They get a disproportional amount of criticism though, because despite being some viewed as the worse in Pixar's selection, they are some of the most profitable, and people hate that. So they gets more criticism than they might deserve. Misogyny doesn't even factor in.	1
I believe that I am worthless. CMV. Well maybe that was a bit harsh, but I think I am insignificant. The universe is much bigger than anything a person can imagine; I don't think that anything I will ever do will matter because of this. This picture reaffirmed how I felt ( I am non-religious and I guess that might be part of why I feel this way (No personal god). One other thing to mention is my personal philosophy is close to Humanism. I have joined healthcare system and believe that helping my fellow man is as close to as being significant as I can. I still ultimately feel that nothing I will ever do will matter. So go ahead Reddit, CMV. **edit: I don't know why someone would down vote this...**	1
"I don't know who you are and what you have or haven't done in life, and therefore I cannot honestly tell you what your individual worth as a person may or may not be. I'm just some guy on the internet. But what I can tell you is this: ""Worthy"" and ""significant"" are human terms for human concepts that only exist relative to human perception. If you feel you are inherently ""not worthy"" due to the vast scale and general nature of the universe, etc., you have misunderstood the very nature of ""worthiness"". To seek confirmation of some innately human value from the universe itself is inherently irrational, and inherently bound to be fruitless. It's about as rational as asking your kitchen table or an orange to assert your worth as a person. Your kitchen table is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question, an orange is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question, and the universe is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question. It's really as simple as that. You are looking for an absolute answer to a relative question, but things don't work that way. All your ""worthiness"" as a human being will have to be determined by human beings because ""worthiness"" is something that only exists in the perception of human beings. The very concept of ""worthiness"" is only one of the many mental tools evolution has equipped us with in order to be able to function as social beings within the context of a society (the ability to do so being, of course, a prerequisite for human survival for much of our history as a species). I know it would be more convenient and more comfortable if there was some way to absolutely determine one's worth, but there isn't. You are therefore left with the task of determining - and more importantly, creating! - your own worth, which might of course be a little cumbersome, but that is simply the nature of human existence. Such is life. Keep your head up, keep a stiff upper lip and carry on, and enjoy the pleasures of life when they come to you. They generally do. Just keep the following in mind: ""Exists only relative to the perception of individual human beings"" is clearly and obviously not the same thing as ""does not exist in any way whatsoever"". And ""doesn't matter in some absolute, unmovable and universal way"" is clearly and obviously not the same thing as ""does not matter in any way at all"". Bet you can't prove me wrong on that."	0
Your imgur link doesn't seem to work. When you talk about things you do mattering, exactly how do you mean it? How big of a contribution do you have to make before you decide that it matters? Is there some number of people you need to help before you matter? Does it count if you matter to a small number of people (friends, family, loved ones) in an intense way? If not, why not?	0
"I don't believe that, regarding sexual preference, we're necessarily born that way. CMV Let me first state that I don't believe that sexual preference is a choice, or that it can be changed through therapy (the evidence definitely seems to be against it). When people say they they were ""born that way,"" maybe what they really mean is simply that they didn't have a choice in the matter. In that sense, I agree. However, AFAIK, there isn't enough hard scientific evidence to support the theory that people are born straight/gay/bi/asexual/etc. I think the possibility exists, but we can't at this point in time, say that for sure. I think another possibility is that while genetic factors, and hormonal influence may play a part, environmental (physical, emotional, social, etc.) factors after birth may also play a part in forming a person's sexuality. Am I wrong? CMV."	1
I don't think you'll find hard evidence that it's set *at birth*, but there is tremendous evidence that genetics play a big role. The most popular piece of evidence is a study done on twins. Identical twins are much more likely to be gay if the other one is gay than fraternal twins -- and the trend holds up even when identical twins are separated at birth. This controls for environmental factors extremely well and shows that their genetics do have a huge component to play in their sexuality. Source:	0
"* you think it's not a choice * you think genetic factors play a role * you think environmental factors play a role. I think you're struggling with the words and not with the concept. If you talk to anyone who thinks people are ""born that way,"" they would not disagree with you on any of those points."	0
Indoor live music gigs are far too loud, and should be quieter. CMV. Why do sound technicians ruin so many indoor gigs by turning the whole volume up (especially the bass) so loud that the entire thing becomes distorted and mushy? I love loud music as much as the next person, but the volume level of music at gigs is absurd. I saw Less Than Jake at a very small venue (with a capacity of about 500 people at most) and the sound levels were absurdly high - the whole thing became a disorienting blur of sound. Recently I brought ear plugs when I went to see The Bronx, and the experience was incredible - I could actually hear the songs in a clarity that was comfortable and enjoyable. It seems to me that seasoned gig goers and sound-techs alike simply don't mind how loud live music is because their ear-drums have been significantly dulled from years of going to loud gigs (effectively removing the need for ear plugs). For those of us with hearing mostly intact, I think gigs are absurdly loud, and sound-techs could reduce the volume by up to 50% in many cases for a much more pleasurable listening experience - still loud, but not so loud that the vocals and rhythm all fuse into what can be, effectively, white noise. In any case the bass needs to come down. When the bass is so loud that you feel your clothes rippling: something is wrong. And yes, I blame the sound-techs and not the band. Being in a band myself, I know that it's very hard to tell what you sound like from the audience when on-stage, even with monitors. So I think that gigs should be quieter. This would not only be more enjoyable, but spare many people the hearing loss later in life that live music can cause. I don't think it should be acceptable to have a gig so loud that you hear a ringing in your ears the next day. Change my view. -------------- P.S. - I go to gigs in London. Maybe this isn't such an issue elsewhere in the world. P.P.S. - As you may have noticed in the title, I'm only referring to indoor gigs. Outdoor gigs still tend to have sound issues of their own, but their volume is generally at a much more comfortable level due to the sound having room to disperse rather than bouncing off walls in an indoor environment. P.P.P.S. - I'm referring specifically to 'guitar oriented' live music. The issues in quality of sound are rarely - in my experience - present during a classical orchestra concert, or a jazz/swing band gig.	1
I may not want to change your view about the volume problem, but I do want to change your opinion regarding who is at fault. Full disclosure, I have been working professionally as a sound engineer for 15 years. I'm not saying that the sound engineer is not also a part of the problem. The fault lies with many parties. As a sound engineer, I fight band stage volume on every band I work with. Many times I have a producer (who writes my paycheck) telling me to turn it up. The guitarist whose amp is turned up to eleven. The band manager who wants the whole thing turned up. The drummer. (Enough said.) And yes, many sound techs just turn it up because the sound system can get that loud, not realizing that there is a difference between can and should. I do the best I can to never mix bands anymore because it's not fun, it's just loud. Plus, I think it may be worse in the US here as there are no local regulations that I know of for volume limits as there can be in the UK. I hope you can see though that there are many factors involved in creating that sound, and that when a show is too loud, a lot of people can be to blame.	1
"I actually agree with you largely. However, a lot of the problem lies on the band itself. As a guitarist, I never would have believed it. But I absolutely did once I shifted into live sound. 1) Drums are fucking loud. Ever hear a drummer tear into a snare? Ever hear one smash his cymbals? In some small club shows, there's almost no need for a mic (except for the thump of a kick, and a little added sound just so nothing gets lost). 2) Often, especially with rock bands, the guitarists feel the need to have guitar amps WAY overpowered for the space they're playing in. Nobody actually *needs* a 100 watt, 8x12 guitar amp and cabinets. 30 watts and a 10"" speaker are more than enough once you have a mic on it. But so many bands crank up their amps to the point where what you're hearing in the audience doesn't have anything to do with the sound guy and everything to do with ""but I NEED to have my amp turned up!"" 3) Way too much bass is a bad thing, yes, but at the same time please remember, your hearing probably isn't going to be damaged from bass that's too loud. It takes a hell of a lot more low-frequency power to do any remote sort of damage to your hearing than you will ever notice in a lifetime. 4) PRO sound guys (not just the tech at your local night club) aren't dulled from years of loud gigs. We actually carry custom-moulded earplugs designed to reduce SPL without changing the sounds we're hearing (too much). What you have to understand there is that MOST concert-goers only see an occasional show. The loud volumes won't do much damage if it only happens once or twice a year. Touring engineers are exposed to it every single day, often over 100 nights a year, plus soundcheck, rehearsals... I'd absolutely recommend earplugs for any frequent concert goer. But it's not going to affect 75%+ (depending on genre) of the audience to see one show that's a bit too loud. That is, assuming this last factor is not in play... 5) A lot of times, it's a crapshoot as to what a venue has when it comes to sound. I tour with a national act, and I call venues before every single show, often two or three times, to make sure what they have will be good enough. Half the time, what I walk into is nothing like what they said on the phone. Or they have the whole rig set up wrong so it's not actually working at its full potential, or it's far too powerful for its own good. The problem gets even worse if the band doesn't have their own engineer; then it's entirely up to a house tech who is usually inexperienced or has already blown their ears out, or both. A band that carries its own sound system is going to be much better, but they're also going to only play larger venues like arenas, and they'll have time to fine-tune the system to work perfectly for the room."	0
"I think classes for ""gifted"" kids (like GATE) meant to provide extra enrichment should instead be offered to struggling students who would benefit more from them. CMV My middle school had GATE, Gifted And Talented Education, to provide ""gifted"" kids with extra enrichment so that they could reach their ""full potential"". The students in the gifted classes often got more attention from teachers than other students, even if those ""regular"" students were just as smart as - if not smarter than - the ""gifted"" ones. I think that, if the kids are really ""gifted"", they shouldn't need extra help, and those ""enrichment"" classes should be given to struggling students who would benefit more from the extra work and attention. I also think that stratifying students in this way causes unnecessary self-esteem issues to students who are deemed ""not smart enough"" for the gifted classes. Therefore, I believe that such classes should be offered for struggling students instead, or not offered at all."	1
I was in GATE, and I have family members that were in special ed and an aunt that still assists with special ed (not just children with severe mental disabilities, but also just slow learners) children in schools. For one, GATE classes are *slightly* harder, but at an accelerated pace as to cover more during the year. That's the difference. We didn't have more time in our GATE classes, the teacher didn't spend more time with us, it was just accelerated learning for the kids who caught onto the material faster. As for resources going towards GATE and not to other struggling children, we didn't get any more than other classes did. It was just another class with a label on it that learned at a different speed. Just like special ed classes for the mentally handicapped, it was just a label put on a class of kids that learn at a different speed. I'd even argue that special needs receive much more funding. My aunt is paid to shadow specific children throughout their day and assist them with school. That's it. A single person on the payroll assigned to different children throughout the years to help them. We didn't get that in GATE. There's also all kinds of remedial classes, tutoring programs, teachers that have specific days to stay behind for after school help, all kinds of resources a struggling child could use to catch up. I guess is what I'm trying to say is we have many resources that aren't cash sinks to help struggling children already. edit: after re-reading this it seems a little jumbled. sorry, I'm half asleep still.	1
I'm not sure I understand, but what I think you are saying is quite offensive... Maybe I am misunderstanding something... GATE has nothing to do with struggling students, it's for the kids who are able to learn faster or at a higher level than the average kids around them. What does that have to do with kids who are having trouble learning the normal material? Are you saying we should stop encouraging kids to learn as much as possible and just treat the smart kids like normal kids and hinder their development purely so we don't hurt someones feelings? I'm sorry if your kid has less potential than mine, but why does that mean my child who is above average should not be able to learn at his rate? Special-Ed classes help the kids below average. Gate classes help the kids above average. Obviously we can't teach every kid individually, but why not at least have some sort of distinction so that each kid is more likely to reach his potential. By your reasoning we should put all kids in the special-ed classes just so we don't hurt anyones feelings. That's how absurd your post sounds to me. I am sorry if my post feels a little hostile, I just feel offended that someone actually think we should actively and directly hinder a kids potential just for the sake of someone potentially feeling bad about not being above average.	0
In a week, I turn 22. I don't see any reason to look forward to any particular birthday for the rest of my life. CMV When you are in your teens and young adult years in the US, there are plenty of birthday milestones to look forward to. At 16, you can get a driver's license. At 17, you can go see R rated films in theatres. At 18, you are a legal adult and can do many things like buy tobacco, vote, get into some clubs/bars/venues, and at 21 you can buy alcohol. But what comes next? I now basically have all the legal and social freedoms that I will ever get, and I cannot think of any particular milestones that I would want to look forward to. Some might say the age when I am able to retire and collect social security, but who knows what that will be like by the time I actually get to that age? (I also don't like the social security system, but that's a debate for another day). I also hope that I make a career for myself that I love enough to not want to retire as soon as I'm able to, so that's another reason why I wouldn't really look forward to that. So please, change my view! I'll probably be away from the computer for an hour or so, but I'll be back later to reply to people.	0
"A bunch of rental services (cars, vacation venues, etc) require the person making the reservation to be at least 25. After that, the decades are generally considered milestones. 30 is when you're ""omg so old"". 40 is when you can start being sad about being ""old"". 50 is when you stop feeling bad about being ""old"". 65 is retirement. 90 is when people start writing newspaper blurbs about your birthday and you start competing for oldest guy in the city."	0
I'm guessing you're American. Apologies if I'm wrong. Here's a few specific milestones I can think of. 25 - Pretty much everyone will now rent you a car without making you pay absurd rates. 26 - Significant drop in car insurance premiums, especially if you're a male. 32 - You're age is a power of 2! You can go around saying that you're 10000 years old! I am looking forward to this 35 - Minimum age of office for some positions, including president.	0
I believe that Linux is fully ready for the desktop, CMV Some of you may not get this, but I have been using Linux as a primary OS for desktops since late 2007. I hold my view because Linux does quite a bit of things: * Allows for more efficient consumption of power * Gives higher performance in general * Is a highly valuable learning experience * Is in most cases open source, allowing anyone to look at the code their systems use Please change my view.	1
The biggest issue is that all of the things you have listed are not primarily concerns for the general public of computer users. Ease of use and familiarity are the chief concerns and these are two metrics in which even the best Linux OS's fails spectacularly. Linux, if time is spent configuring it, can be great. Unfortunately most people will never take the time to do this and find the UI of the OS quite annoying and counter intuitive after 2 decades of exposure to windows. Clearly you are someone who is knowledgeable in computers so you see no problem in adapting to Linux use. Imagine having the headache you would receive teaching every member of your extended family how to operate Linux. Now expand that onto a population that isn't going to have a handy guide to hold their hand the whole way. Until Linux takes significant steps to adapt it's UI to a more user friendly design it will never receive more than a niche market share of OS's. Private citizens and businesses alike will be weary to adapt it until this problem is addressed.	0
"While exercising your ability to read manuals and use Google is educational and, in this area, likely a worthwhile investment in the modern world, it is generally not what users are after. Personally, when choosing between two programs I don't give ""requires extensive learning"" a significant positive weight. As for performance, I've found that mostly to be an aspect of more minimalistic setups, which require more experience to set up and run. In short, the benefits you list do exist, but they are all very long-term; in the short-term, there are plenty of obstacles such as needing to find replacements for programs one uses, or setting up wine, or configuring Xorg. Many common operations, such as syncing with an iPhone, are not officially supported. Flash is still not exactly perfect. The situation is getting better, but expecting people to move without becoming less productive for at least a few weeks is unreasonable. It is similar to suggesting people learn Dvorak or Lojban; perhaps ultimately superior in some sense, but not a sufficient benefit for the average user. -Proud Linux user since 2006."	1
"I don't see any reason why single use restrooms should be gender oriented. CMV. By ""single use restroom"" I mean a public restroom with a lockable door that allows only one occupant at a time. I don't know if these are common all over the world but they are very common in the United States Now, I understand the advantages of a single use restroom. They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user. However, at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice. The most convincing argument I've read against unisex restrooms is that some people are uncomfortable urinating/defecating around the opposite sex, but this doesn't apply to single use restrooms since the occupant is alone anyway. What if there are five women in line for a single use restroom, but no men? That line of women could be moving twice as fast if they had two restrooms available. Unfortunately for them, the other restroom is only for men, so they're just going to have to hold it. This restriction strikes me as totally arbitrary. It has an obvious downside with no notable upsides that I can see. That said, I've already had /r/changemyview flip my opinion several times when I really wasn't expecting it to. Maybe there are some points I haven't considered."	0
"Point 1. I think that one of the biggest reasons they have bathroom segregation is because of the potential social awkwardness between genders. Imagine this guys...You're completely destroying this bathroom. Maybe you had some re-fried beans for lunch, or maybe that sushi from last night just isn't sitting right, regardless, you're totally annihilating this toilet. Suddenly, you hear a knock at the door. ""Someone's in here!"" you murmur. You wrap things up as quickly as you can. You get yourself cleaned up and open the door, only to see the most drop-dead gorgeous woman you've ever laid eyes on, and she actually kinda smiles at you. Then the mustard gas cloud you had trapped in the unisex restroom wafts out and hits her. You watch as that smile turns to confusion, then to horror, and even tears. By the way, that situation is even more uncomfortable the other way around for women. We're more uncomfortable about our shit smell than anybody. I know some of you guys are reading this thinking, ""I don't give a fuck, bask in my ambiance, bitch!"" but for some people, it really is an uncomfortable situation. Also, point 2, I do think that unisex bathrooms increases some likelihood of rape/molestation. In segregated bathrooms, a man is somewhat deterred from going into the women's room for fear of being seen entering(not that this stops it from happening but it is at least a deterrent). However, a man going into a unisex bathroom to prey on a woman or child is much less noticeable. Point 3 is just the differences in genders. Do you guys really want to see tampon dispensers on the walls and bloody period pads in the trashcans? Women don't care to see urinals or condom dispensers, or whatever else you guys have in there. Point 4. Not that this is always a bad thing, but unisex bathrooms greatly increase the chance of hetero sex happening in the bathroom. A man can enter and a female shortly behind, and no one bats an eye. This may be great for the amorous couple, but what about the rest of us? What about the line that's forming because these two love birds are having an all night fuck fest? What about the poor soul who is next to enter to find bodily fluids covering the walls? What about the janitor who has to scrub that shit at the end of the night? Finally, I personally don't like sharing a bathroom with anyone, but if I must, I'd rather it be a woman. We may be disgusting creatures, but at least I know what to expect, and the judgement will be limited."	0
Stop trying to obsessively advocate for equality in gender specific situations. 1. **Function** Men and women are anatomically different. Women bathrooms have the necessary equipment to support the female anatomy, and male bathrooms have the necessary equipment (urinals) to support the male anatomy. 2. **Predation** It is overwhelmingly more likely for pedophiles to be the opposite gender as their victims than it is for them to be the same gender. Integrating public bathrooms makes it easier for child predators to prey on children. 3. **Privacy** One of the key elements of a bathroom is that it offers privacy. OP, would you support integrated locker rooms in public schools? Do you think that this would do more harm or good?	0
I believe that mainstream contemporary art since the 1950s is juvenile and shallow; in short it is not art. CMV please I believe that art requires skill, talent, insight and hard work -- that properly executed, art touches the soul of the viewer. I've taken a few art history courses, and to my eye, western art peaked with the [Post-Impressionists]( It's been downhill since then. There is an ineffable something in the [sunflowers of Van Gogh]( or a [Cezanne]( or [Monet]( that is not there in modern and post modern art. I don't get anything from pieces like [this Jackson Pollock]( or [this Rothko]( for example. They neither excite nor inspire me, and definitely do not touch my soul. Reading about these artists, it appears that they, at one time, did something innovative that caught the eye of the art world. Instead of becoming fleetingly notorious, they became famous, and this fame fed on itself, making them 'masters' in the eyes of the art world. Articles like [this one]( where a forger created dozens of works supposedly by various modern artists, and managed to fool critics, art historians and collectors, just reinforces my view. Not all art since 1950 is bad of course, I felt an instant connection the first time I saw the work of [Kieron Williamson]( (for instance, [this landscape]( but most contemporary work seems to me dull and insipid. I'll be happy if anyone can change my view. N.B. By art I mean paintings, sculptures and installations. Other forms of art, writing, drama and music especially, are still interesting and healthy. Edit: added links to examples.	1
"I work in an art gallery. You'd be amazed at how much crap there is pre-1950s that manages to survive. There were big trends of ""artists"" who pre-painted torsos and then hastily painted their client's heads on top, because it was a quick way for the average joe to make some decent money without much talent. Half of these guys didn't even bother painting a coherent hand. There will always be amateurs, con artists, and plain art you don't like screwing up what you would otherwise consider a great era. Also, you seem to have an issue with 1970s abstract expressionism and are using it to represent all contemporary art. There is a lot of fantastic stuff out there today, but as with all kinds of creations, most of it will be crap or stuff you don't like. I wish I was on my home computer so I could browse my collection of contemporary art and show you some of my favourites. For now, pick up an issue of Juxtapoz or Spectrum 21 to see the kind of cool things that are happening right now. Some I picked up just from a quick browse of Juxtapoz's website: [David Mach's coat hanger sculpture] ( [Chiharu Shiota's installations]( and [Stephanie Clark's embrodiery]( It's worth pointing out a lot of contemporary artists are now doing things on larger scales or with materials that cannot be properly represented online (eg video, the texture of string, illusions that can only be felt from a certain perspective in the room). If you're not regularly setting foot in galleries, you're missing a lot of great stuff."	1

I believe 9/11 was an inside job. CMV Around my senior year of high school (2009-ish) I became quite interested in public events and foreign relations and wanted to become more knowledgeable about how the United States compared to the other nations without the star-spangled bias you get from public school and fox news. Not too long after that I was exposed to 9/11: In Plane Site as well as others, and the copious amounts of conspiracy videos of YouTube. As someone of above average intelligence and a skeptic by nature I have never taken conspiracy theories too seriously, as many rely on sparse circumstantial evidence but for whatever reason this feels different. My main reasons for suspecting foul play in order of importance: 1. BUILDING 7!?!? 2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns. 3. Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns. 4. Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene. Im honestly not sure what to make of all this evidence, but something just strikes me as unsettling, and I see a lot of skeptics to whom I look up to (Micheal Shermer, Bill Maher to a lesser degree, etc.) dismissing the notion and Im not sure what Im overlooking that they arent. Im swearing into the Navy on Wednesday and this is the my biggest cause of apprehension about joining the war machine so hopefully one or more of you fine people can CMV! disclaimer: First Post so I apologize in advance if I am in violation of any rules or protocol EDIT: That didn't take long. Thanks to those who responded, now I'll rejoin the ranks of the lurkers. EDIT #2: So a SHIT TON of new comments over night, and sorry to say I cant address them individually, not that yall are craving my opinion, but I read them all and its good to note that other seemingly intelligent people shared my concerns and skepticism and I really enjoyed the healthy discourse below. Both sides have produced compelling arguments but after reassessing probability figures and relinquishing my right to observe evidence and draw my own conclusions due to my egregious lack of knowledge on the subject, the reality is that it would be insurmountably difficult to orchestrate something of this magnitude. I still think its a little fishy, but my common sense tells me thats probably due to authorities lack of a clear picture, not direct involvement and subsequent cover up. Thanks again for playing, hope to see you all again. EDIT #3: here is a [link]( to a post in /r/conspiracy detailing the arguments that cast doubt on the official story in much better detail than I had previously. Another redditor brought that to my attention and thought you guys may have a go at it.	1
1) ALL of the buildings in the complex were damaged by massive buildings falling on them, building 7 just got the worst of it. IIRC, building 7 fell about an hour after 1 and 2, and firefighters had already evacuated because they could tell it was on the verge of collapse. 2) If you watch video of the towers falling, you can see they started at where the planes hit. There were several stories above where the planes hit, so that's a lot of weight falling at once onto the rest of the building, which caused a chain reaction of each floor falling into the next. The building wasn't built for that kind of stress, which caused the whole thing to collapse pretty quickly. As far as the cut beams you were talking about, there were only a few of them, and truthers cherry picked them out. 3) When the towers fell, each floor sandwitched into the next. There's a lot of air in between each floor, and it has to go somewhere. the easiest escape out is weakened windows (the explosions coming out of windows some truthers like to point out) or down the stairwell, which ended in the basement. I never heard about a burned janitor, but that air coming into the basement would be really hot. 4) Thermite is just a mixture of a metal powder and a oxidizer, typically aluminum and iron oxide. You don't need a chemical reaction to make it, just to physically mix it (mythbusters made a bunch by putting the two powders in a cement mixer). You'd find a lot of that stuff mixed together when 2 100+ story buildings collapse. In addition to that, an inside job would require weeks of work, including cutting away walls to wrap the support beams with explosives or thermite (which unless channeled, only burns down btw). Many of the over 30,000 people that worked there every day must have noticed that, but no one did.	0
"&gt; BUILDING 7 What exactly was the benefit of these unknown insiders destroying building 7? It accomplished nothing compared to the Twin Towers and Pentagon in terms of boosting public support for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the only other theory I can think of was that there was some sensitive data stored there. In which case, wouldn't these ""insiders"" have a much easier job sneaking in and destroying the data rather than destroying the entire building? &gt;The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed The buildings fell at free fall speed because they were being piledriven by all the building on top of it. Think about how much weight was at and above where the two planes hit. How many tons of metal, concrete, etc. came down the minute the collapse started? That much weight is pretty much unstoppable. &gt;implying a coordinated severance of support beams... Have you seen the amount of wiring and explosives that normal demolitions companies use to destroy a building? How much time it takes to set that stuff up? How much more time it would take to set it all up but have it all be perfectly hidden? How could these ""insiders"" sneak into the building undetected by security personnel and janitorial staff and do all of this work? Work by the way that was **impossibly durable** because it all survived the impact of a jetliner and the subsequent fire. How do you design a demolition project (which is by it's very nature, prone to explosion) to withstand the impact of a plane and a massive fire? &gt;with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns. A 45 degree angle cut only really makes sense on a vertical support, so how did they attach thermite to a vertical support? Even nano-thermite takes considerable time to burn through a support that thick, so whatever you're using to attach the thermite is just going to burn and fall off long before the I-beam is cut through. &gt;Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns. I suspect this was probably the result of debris falling down an elevator shaft or something similar, but I've got a more important point: What would these noises mean? The buildings toppled from the top down and once the collapse started, Atlas himself couldn't hold that shit up. &gt;Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene. A building falling with such force pulverized almost everything in it's path, including rusty stuff and stuff made out of aluminum. Here's the kicker though: **how could they have possibly gotten away with it?** Breaking the story would make you a national hero and celebrity, so how much money would it take to buy you off? Now take that amount and multiply it by the number of people that had to be accomplices. Dozens of demolitions *experts* (and I mean they have to have a demolition superpower to pull off this job), Security and Janitorial staff that took a bribe to effectively let their friends/coworkers die, guys willing to kill themselves for the job. Add onto that all the people that found out working on the official report of what happened and every guy at Popular Mechanic that learned the dark truth. And every single one of them took the bribe? Not only did they take the bribe, but none of them have come out about it yet? The NSA couldn't even get away with it's spying operation when it wasn't hurting anybody and had noble intentions (wrong and an invasion of privacy, but still...noble intentions); but you think that a group could get away with murdering 5,000 civilians? The first person to come out would be a celebrity and a hero. He'd be on talk shows, have book and movie deals, and get his name written in history. But not a single person is willing to do that? To propose that 9/11 was an inside job raises so many questions, and I can practically guaranty any answers you give are just going to raise even more questions."	0
Alcohol is bad, please don't let me grow up boring I'm 16 years old, and throughout my childhood my parents have been kind of pretty overprotective, not too much but eventually it resulted in me being fearful of smoking, any drugs, and alcohol. The two former I don't mind, I wouldn't by far like to be interested in smoking and/or doing drugs, but the latter is kind of worrying me - alcohol is pretty damn normal in society, and I can't grow up sipping cola always and everywhere. I'm afraid that alcohol will make drunk and eventually lose control of what I'm doing, and doing some extremely stupid stuff that I'll regret for ages. Also I'm afraid of any possible brain-damage. Someone please convince me that alcohol isn't bad. : FYI; Alcohol at 16 is legal in my country.	1
"&gt;convince me that alcohol isn't bad. This is vague. What precisely do you mean when you say that alcohol is ""bad."" I'll assume that whe you say it is bad, what you mean is ""I shouldn't drink alcohol."" While I'm not personally a huge drinker of alcohol, I think I can convince you that should sometimes drink it. The first thing to point out is that if you have only a little (~1 beer), it will not have much of an effect on you. You might notice a small effect if you've never had it before, but you might not even notice it. In my experience, the effect of drinking one beer is probably comparable to the effect of eating one dose of chewable Tylenol. Maybe even less noticeable than that. You might respond by asking ""Why should I drink something that will have no appreciable effect on me?"" The answer is, unfortunately, that sometimes you will be in situations (e.g. parties) where abstaining might bring attention onto you that you don't want. If you have a single drink and say that you've had enough after that, it will be decidedly less awkward. So this might mean you should drink in those situations. (Personally, I've gotten to the point where I no longer will have a drink just to fit in, but when I was 16, or 18, or 20, I definitely would do this.) But what about having more than one drink? Well, clearly you should take things one step at a time (and from your description of yourself, I don't expect that you'd go out and do 10 shots this evening). But some people, many people in fact, quite like the feeling of being somewhat 'drunk.' It can make you more relaxed, more social. Some people who have social anxieties find that alcohol helps them to come out of their shell when they are with groups of people. In sum, alcohol *is* bad in some ways, and it can be dangerous. But other times, it can be relatively benign, and in some situations, it can even be good!"	1
"Well, you might want to try explaining why you think alcohol is bad in a little more detail, as I don't really have much to go off of here. Basically, alcohol in moderation is a tool for making certain experiences more enjoyable. There are different levels of intoxication. It's not like there's a threshold you cross where you go from coherent and coordinated to stumbling baboon. You can drink slowly and in moderation over the course of a night and just get enough alcohol in your system to have a ""Buzz"" going. It lowers your inhibitions enough to make you more talkative, so social situations are either more fun, or easier to stomach depending on your point of view. It produces a unique feeling which is enjoyable, so even if you're just watching Breaking Bad or reading a book by yourself it's still a fun activity. You're 16, so I'm not going to recommend you start drinking, that's against the law, but alcohol isn't really something to be fearful of. When you understand the effects of alcohol, if you're **responsible** about when you drink and how much you have, it is simply a tool to help you have a good time."	0
News is bad for you. CMV The points made in [this]( Guardian article: * News misleads - A car drives over a bridge, and the bridge collapses. What does the news media focus on? The car. The person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he experienced the crash (if he survived). But that is all irrelevant. What's relevant? The structural stability of the bridge. * News is irrelevant to your life - Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that – because you consumed it – allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career or your business. * News has no explanatory power - Will accumulating facts help you understand the world? Sadly, no. * News is toxic to your body - It constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. * News increases cognitive errors - News feeds the mother of all cognitive errors: confirmation bias. * News inhibits thinking - Thinking requires concentration. Concentration requires uninterrupted time. News pieces are specifically engineered to interrupt you. * News works like a drug - As stories develop, we want to know how they continue. With hundreds of arbitrary storylines in our heads, this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore. * News wastes time * News makes us passive - News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence * News kills creativity Edit: formatting	0
"News is TERRIBLE for the general public, for the reasons you cited, and also because of herd mentality. You only need to look at reddit sometimes to see how people tend to flock to some news, disregard others, and then validate their views based on each other's pats on the back. However, you said ""News is bad for you"", with the ""you"" being interchangeable with anyone. the problem is that News are GREAT for some people : analytic-minded people, scientists... and historians. Let's pretend for 5 seconds that news don't exist. We the people live in blissful ignorance, and our leaders still get informed of everything through their secret service and intelligence bureaus. For the sake of this discussion, let's imagine that no leaks have ever happened. Every major scientific discovery has gone unnoticed by 99% of the population. With no media outlet to turn to, scientists have to resort to peddling to show off their wares. When they get noticed by someone powerful, their invention gets stolen - it's much easier to apss it off as your own than it is to pay royalties. And without big news agencies to bring the public eye to that sort of thing, who's going to argue ? Let's imagine that everything up to WWII went along like it did in the real world. Nobody knows about the concentraiton camps. Jewish people get killed off on a larger scale, the culprits don't really get hunted down, and no-one really cares : we're all blissfully ignorant. Let's pop forward thousands of years : no textbook ever mentions WWII, or if they do, they give a propagandist view of it, and America is glorified. why ? because with the media outlet, no-one has any experience t share to the world, no-one has a story that sticks, and veterans die with their memories. also, why would the american government publish a true account of the thing when they could make it seem like they were heroes ? any government would do the same. Another situation : missing kid. No media outlets : no amber alert, etc. So all in all, I think news are useful. (not feeling particularly motivated for a great closing sentence)"	0
"It really depends on how you read the news. I myself have a google newsfeed, and I scan it a few times a day to check for a tailored set of developments that I think could actually influence the world's overall status quo. Science, world events, BBC, Technology, major business stories, and major US politics. Things I have specifically banned from my feed: any celebrity story of any kind. ""One weird trick"" Health stories. ""Weather happened and it killed 2 people"" stories. My goal is to see how the world, as a whole, is developing. I use the incoming information to piece together political trends, scientfic discoveries that matter, and public opinion changes. It requires concentration, creative thought, and a logical mind. It's also a lot of fun. TL;DR I agree with your point, but only for sensationalized news stories. Looking at history in the making is a lot more fun."	1
"I think most ""Modern Art"" is pretentious, takes nearly no skill, and is sub-par compared to art before that period. CMV. I've heard the arguments behind the many paintings under the category of Modern Art. I just don't see how these can be considered ""good art"". I won't deny that it is art, I just consider them horrible pieces of art. I don't think all modern art is horrible. Just a lot of it. I'll provide examples: (This one in particular). It's just a solid color, seriously. I feel that the message the ""artist"" is trying to convey can probably be sent in a more pleasing image. I feel that ""modern art"" is just an excuse for untalented artist to create expressions that are lacking in substance without being called out as a bad artist. Change my view, please. Thank you for your time."	1
I have the direct opposite view, so let me weigh in-I feel like art didn’t get properly started until the 20th century, the stuff that came before it is interesting, but doesn’t have the same understanding of what art is, and usually doesn’t even seem to be trying to. They seem more interested with trying to directly imitate nature or convey religious ideas than explore or define art for its own sake. I’ll focus on the Mondrian painting, since I consider him to be the most important artist of the 20th century. You claim that there would be a better way for these artists to express their ideas, you also claim that they require little/no skill. If you look at Mondrian’s body of work, his ability to paint realistically is obviously great, but he wanted to explore what a painting actually *was*, and condense that to its core; to strip away everything that wasn’t *essential*. This is why he used only horizontal and vertical lines, because they implied every other possible line and shape, and the three primary colours because they implied every other colour. How else would you suggest he convey this message? His solution seems, to me, brilliant, elegant, and inevitable. Modern art is concerned with “what is art?” and the modern paintings you have shown are concerned with painting as colour on surface, which, to paraphrase Clement Greenberg, is all they are and all they should be. These concerns fly in direct opposition to your own, which, from your criticisms, seem to be primarily about producing pretty pictures.	0
"Modern artists I met have the same basic skills as those who paint in a more classic style. They all know how to draw straight lines, how to blend colors correctly, use perspective, etc. If modern art really ""[took] no skill"", then you'd think everybody would be able to do what they do. You'd be surprised at how much probably went into making that solid blue work. Imagine how different the impact would be if it were a different shade, or the dimensions of the frame were a bit different. I'm not an artist (I'm a CS student of all people), but even just a minute amount of exposure to the practice behind art will allow you to understand how these paintings work."	1
"I believe that antidepressants mess you up and addict you in the long term because without them you are back to the ""reality"" goggles. CMV I've been depressed for a long time but I'm still a few months away from adulthood. I live in a small society where going to therapists is largely criticized. I'll move away from home in four to five months and I've been seriously considering going to a therapist. My problem stems from the fact that I hear so much about how antidepressants make you ""better"" but to me it seems like those people sound like drug addicts. ""when I'm on my pills in happy but when I'm not I'm all grumpy!"" I'm sorry but if I felt that my life depended on a bottle of pills then I'd get more depressed. my friends don't take depression seriously and those who do think it gets better by telling me that ""I should look on the bright side of life"" but to me that sounds like straight up bullcrap. I'm saying this because I don't believe depression is reality; it's just much closer to reality."	1
"If you had an illness that was not depression would you feel bad about taking medication to cure it? Or, in some cases, to just be able to live without having to many problems? Do you see a diabetic who has to depend on insulin as a drug addict? Depression is actually a pretty complex illness. You might have the same symptoms as another person and it still could be for different reasons. If you have time, read this: so, with all those different things going on in depression there are also different ways of helping people who have depression. There does not seem to be a one size fits all treatment. Different drugs try in different ways to right things that might have gone wrong in the brain. When somebody starts taking antidepressants they do not magically feel better. It often takes a few weeks for anything to set in at all. That is different to the sort of drugs you get high on, as they work pretty fast. Sometimes a person does not feel better on an antidepressant at all and sometimes they feel worse. Sometimes they feel better but the side effects are not worth it. - Alcohol always makes you drunk in a relatively predictable way, right (even though some people act different when drunk than others)? Antidepressants are not so predictable. If an antidepressant works though, that is pretty great. Mood starts to improve slowly and you start to realize things you did not even take into account before anymore. Things that are just as valid an real as what you noticed while being depressed. Yes, your friends care for you and yes, you are worth it. The person sounding all frustrated when you talk with them about how you are feeling? - They just want to help but have no idea how, they are not 'just annoyed"". - Sure, there might be no life after death, but what stops you from having one while you ARE alive? No, how you are feeling right now is not invalid and I know how frustrating it is when people just say to ""look on the bright side of life"". You see, when you are not depressed you can be sad and then you can stop being sad. Sometimes you can even make yourself stop being sad. Your friends are trying to help you, they are seeing good things going on along with the bad things and they don't know that to you everything is just somewhat worthless, unimportant, empty. You say you are depressed and they hear you are sad. So, they try to tell you that you do not need to be sad, that things are all right. (If you are like me back when I had my depression you know that there is no real big reason to be depressed and being reminded of that makes things even worse, 'cause it does not stop how you are feeling and nobody seems to realize that...) Now, is depression making you see the world more real than the ""normal"" view on life? You are talking about ""Depressive Realism"" and it is actually a thing people study. Findings are not fully conclusive and different people argue different things based on different studies and meta studies. It's another interesting read: One more thing: You remember how I said non depressed people can be sad, but also stop being sad? - When you are on working antidepressants you will also still be able to feel sad. You will not suddenly always be happy. You will be able to feel horrible if something bad happens. - But you also will be able to feel great when things happen that are great. Able to feel alive. Oh, and not all people stay on antidepressants. For many it is just a tool, a medication to help them get better, till there brain has fixed itself and can work right on it's own. I am one of those people. --- Sorry if this was a bit to rambly, I fear I might have tried to address to many points at once."	1
"Whoever tells you that is being irresponsible or has never taken anti-depressants. Xanex will give you that instant-calmness and serenity, and it can be addictive if you take it more than you have to. There are other drugs like it, but normal, run of the mill anti-depressants like Abilify and Prozac won't do that to you. It's not as if you feel happy all the time, but it allows you to be able to feel happy at all. Depression isn't always prolonged melancholy--the most debilitating part of depression, I've found, is not finding any joy in anything. Allowing your brain to feel positive sensations again is what I think should be the goal of taking anti-depressants. In short, I think your view of anti-depressants as happy-pills that make you magically better is just as warped as everyone else's view of depression in your town. Also, get a diagnosis from a therapist or psychiatrist before you say: ""I've been depressed."" Depressed isn't a feeling, it's a state of mind and it's much more debilitating than just feeling sad. It's extremely complex and taking a 10-point quiz online does not qualify you to say whether you're depressed or not. When you have to make the decision between feeling like a pile of shit and watching your life flow down the drain and taking a pill every day or every other day, the choice will become crystal clear. It's not an end-all-be-all--a lot of times, there's a reason you're depressed, but being unstuck by anti-depressants at least allows you to be able to work towards solving those issues."	0
I think sterilization should be an optional punishment for those found guilty of child negligence/abuse. CMV Just like the title states. Thoughts to the contrary?	0
I understand how horrible child abuse is. There are many thing which are horrible. However, we should not permanently punish people for mistakes they made in the past. Maybe if we could sterilize them for ten years or so that I see works. Tails comes from a person who made a mistake or two and was busted, now I find it exteremly difficult to find work. I find it hard to find work at pizza hut, I just finished my chemistry degree and no one will take me do to two felonies...	1
"I'd argue that the problem with this is that while it makes a certain sort of sense, history shows that it would be applied for bad purposes and that the solution proposed causes more problems than it solves. This isn't speculation, but rather the only conclusion that can be drawn from the USA's prior history of judicially mandated sterilization. One of the stated purposes [1] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children. In practice what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage (even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect), and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed. I don't at all like the idea of people with a past history of neglect and abuse having kids. And I'm not speaking abstrctly here, I've got relatives who are abusive and neglectful towards their children (CPS has taken them away, and quite rightly so) and they keep having more children (which CPS can't take away until they manage to gather evidence of abuse and/or neglect, so the newborn has a month or three living with horrible people before CPS can do it's job and get the kids out). If there were ever candidates for forcible sterilization, I know two personally and agree 100% that in a perfect world they would not be allowed to reproduce. But, unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world. We live in a nation where the courts and police can be statistically shown to police minority groups more heavily than majority groups [2], we live in a world where the courts give longer sentences to minority groups than to majority groups [3]. Moreover, the courts have a statistically demonstrable tendency to simply not charge rich people, and on the rare occasion rich people do get into legal trouble they get lighter sentences than poor people (if for no other reason than that rich people can afford really great lawyers, while poor people get overworked public defenders). Further, we have historic evidence that the last time it was tried, mandatory sterilization was directed mainly against the poor and black. Given all that, I would argue that the social problems caused by legally mandating sterilization are going to outweigh the benefits of having fewer children abused or neglected. I don't like that. I honestly wish I could support mandatory sterilization because I've seen firsthand what happens when people unfit for parenthood keep having kids. I will say that I think the better solution is reality based, age appropriate, sex ed in schools, starting at kindergarten and continuing through graduation. And easily available free contraception. Because the truth is that most of the people who are having kids they abuse and neglect don't really want kids in the first place. This also isn't speculation, in nations where sex ed is better, and contraception is more affordable or paid for by the government, the rate of child abuse and neglect is lower than in the USA. [1] I say ""one"" because another of the big stated purposes of the America's foray into court ordered sterilization was eugenics. [2] Example: the majority of people arrested for possession of marijuana are black, despite the fact that every study done to date has shown that black people use marijuana at a significantly lower rate than white people. All things being equal, you'd expect the majority of arrests for possession of marijuana to be white (not only are whites the majority, but they use pot more frequently). Yet black people get arrested for it more than white people. [3] Black people get sentences about 60% longer, on average, than white people who committed the same crime."	1
"Unless an animal clearly doesn't enjoy what's happening, I believe bestiality should not be morally frowned upon. I've searched and found no good arguments, so CMV (read the first sentence before you downvote) **Before you downvote, please be aware that I have searched this subreddit on the subject of bestiality before, and every single submission has been downvoted to oblivion, yet there are no good, logical, rational arguments that make a good attempt at changing somebody's view on the subject material (considering the thread may have 6 points, 18 upvotes and 12 downvotes, and its top comment may only have 3 points, with like 9 upvotes and 6 downvotes)** I would like to address a couple of arguments though. The issue of **""consent.""** But I believe that animals are in a position to be able to respond back and clearly show whether they're uncomfortable when you're doing something, or not. Animals are not bound by law (consciously anyways) to refrain from attacking you, getting frustrated, annoyed, or anything, if you were to take them out of their comfort zone. So I believe unless an animal's behavior implies ""no,"" that it should be acceptable, and if somebody continues to have sex with an animal who implies ""no,"" it will be obvious from signs of trauma stemming from the animal, and should be classified under animal abuse. There's also an argument I heard, **""They don't have a conscious grasp of sex, so that means they can not consent, meaning it's not okay!""** I am of the belief that, as long as it is not harming the animal, whether an animal knows what you're doing or not is completely irrelevant. I personally do not practice bestiality, nor do I want to, nor have I ever wanted to. But to me, it just doesn't seem like a bad thing. I feel like bestiality is only frowned upon because society hates taboos, ESPECIALLY sexual taboos. So please. Change my view. I'm not set-in-stone on this opinion. I just feel I have not been adequately given enough reasons to change it."	1
"If I were to guess (and sorry, but I don't feel like researching this from work), I would say that the relevant argument probably deals with two issues: 1. Is it possible for an animal to become traumatized in ways that are not readily apparent during the act itself? If trauma can manifest *after* the fact, then there might be no reasonable way of protecting the animal except to ban bestiality in its entirety. 2. Assuming the potential harm *is* apparent beforehand, the question becomes whether we trust the person seeking the activity to be the one to judge. If you're looking to get your jollies with your poodle Fifi, are you going to notice a subtle ""no"" clue from a small animal that could never physically resist (or is too scared to)? These two issues are a lot of why statutory rape laws exist - not because we think that all 16 year olds are incapable of a mature sexual relationship, but because a lot of them are and it's not always easy to tell beforehand which are and which aren't. To make it worse, we don't trust the ones encouraging the relationship to make a sound judgment on that issue."	0
"It seems like you want a moral argument: Your definition of consent that you outlined is the absence of refusal, but that's not what consent is. There are various cases, for example, in which boyfriends have coerced their girlfriends into having sex, so that the girls don't give permission but don't or can't necessarily outright refuse, even if they would not like to have sex. Most people would consider this as a form of rape. This problem is exacerbated when it comes to animals. There is not really any way to clearly communicate between animals and humans to do any consenting. Sure, maybe you can try to ""assume"" the animal is consenting because it isn't resisting, but some animals just stay really still out of fear. Even if there's no readily apparent physical harm, there can be psychological harm, which is much harder to gauge. I've seen dogs that are very submissive because they've gone through abuse, but it's often hard to differentiate between those who are naturally submissive or forced into submission, especially when it happened at a very early age. I suppose you could argue that the animals themselves might be the ones initiating the sex, but also remember that there is a huge power imbalance. Animals are not humans, even if they may have some human characteristics, and they do not think or respond as we would. We are *much* smarter than animals, even more so than children. We can sometimes literally condition them into what we want them to be (a more extreme version of teachers or relatives ""conditioning"" children to love them in a sexual way). So unless there comes a different species that is equally as smart as us and makes similar thought and behavior processes as us, sex with animals will never be moral."	1
"I believe Obama should be impeached and tried in civilian court for the unlawful killing of US Citizens in drone strikes. CMV. As the title says, I think President Obama (and any others directly involved) should be impeached by Congress, subsequently removed from office, and tried in civilian court for (at the very least) murder for the killing of US citizens in overseas drone strikes. It has been well known for quite some time that the Obama administration has used drones overseas to kill certain targets, and that some of those killed were United States citizens. This is no longer something that people discuss and the government doesn't comment on; the administration has now admitted to the killing of four **US citizens** in drone strikes, three of whom were not targets. Sources: My main argument stems from a reading of the Constitution. The Constitution represents a contract between the Government and The People. I find the following excerpts to be particularly important in this case (listed in order of applicability, with emphasis added): ~~Amendment XIV, Section 1, Paragraph 1: &gt;**All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States** and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; **nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.**~~ Amendment V: &gt;**No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury**, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, **nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law**; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. Amendment VI: &gt;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the **right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury** of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and **to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence [sic].** Article III, Section 2, Paragraph 3: &gt;The **Trial of all Crimes**, except in Cases of Impeachment, **shall be by Jury**; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Article II, Section IV: &gt;**The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of**, Treason, Bribery, or other **high Crimes and Misdemeanors.** (Online source for quotations: In my understanding of the Constitution, ~~all four~~ three of the fatalities were unlawful. ~~The killing of Anwar Al-Awlacki should be classified Murder in the First Degree, as it was clearly premeditated and he was not tried, so the killing cannot be deemed capital punishment.~~ The killing of Al-Awlacki can be justified by saying he was an enemy combatant, the capture of whom would have been infeasible. However, if the three were accidental as claimed, they are still felony manslaughter. Such felony level offenses are gross abuses of power, and must fit the definition of a ""high crime"". This, in my understanding, makes it obvious that impeachment is an appropriate course of action, and, if the Senate finds the defendants guilty, they should then be tried in civilian court, since the offenses are against other citizens of the United States. Change my view. **EDIT** /u/Jazz-Cigarettes changed my view on Al-Awlacki, but I remain unconvinced that the other three deaths are not impeachable offenses. **EDIT 2** As /u/Tyrelxpeioust pointed out, the XIV Amendment applies only to the States (and so is irrelevant here), while the V Amendment is relevant."	0
I think that in general, the drone strikes are problematic in a veritable cornucopia of different ways, but here's my take on al-Awlaki. He was both a U.S. citizen a senior member of al-Qaeda, and so it's fairly difficult to argue that he wasn't committing treason, right? So in a perfect world, he'd deserve a trial for that treason, the result of which almost certainly would've been conviction and execution. But he'd been out of the country and on the run for years, AND he was still actively participating in and abetting the operations of al-Qaeda right up until his death. So what if a trial for al-Awlaki was never realistically going to be a possibility? What if there was never going to be a feasible opportunity to capture him or conduct a raid on him a la bin Laden? It's not like he was a random high-value terrorist who regularly made visits to the U.S. where he could be easily captured. If he was revealed to be checking out a falafel restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Obama administration chose to drone strike him into oblivion when they could have easily apprehended him instead, that would be a regrettable decision. I think al-Awlaki raises an interesting question: what do you do about an American citizen who is actively committing treason against the country, but is doing so while on the run and who may be difficult or impossible to capture? Do you allow him to continue coordinating terrorist attacks against you because you can't capture and try him, even though you *could* kill him?	0
Other users have shown how his actions are probably legal, but from a moral standpoint, why is the fact that some of them were American even relevant? Is killing an American worse than killing a foreigner? With regard to Al-Awlacki, if you are involved in a terrorist group, why should the fact that you were born in the US protect you? I understand why people have a problem with drone strikes in general, but I do not understand why the fact that one of the targets was American matters for any reasons other than legal ones.	0
I think that diamond engagement rings are a sham. CMV First off, a bit about me. I'm a young male, I don't want to get married yet, but would like to some day. I also don't want a big wedding, or to have children, so I guess you could say that i'm not very traditional. I have no problem buying a plain ring or a ring with an alternative to diamonds, as long as it's under a couple of hundred euros. The main reason I don't want to buy an engagement ring is money. They are ridiculusly overpriced. I'm not willing to pay a couple of grand for a shiny rock. I think the money could be much better spent on a a great holiday, or to help start your married life together. Also, I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren't rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market. I think that people are brainwashed into thinking that this is a symbol of love. That your prospective life partner doesn't think you're worth it, if they don't buy you a shiny rock. This materialistic urge that is drilled into people fom a young age, by people who stand to profit from it, is something I don't buy into, and don't want to comply with or encourage. I want my view changed because all the women in my family disagree with me, and i'm worried about it leading to relationship problems down the line. Edit: My view has been partially changed in some ways. I can now see some merit in certain people buying diamonds. Alas my core beliefs on the subject stil hold firm. Thank you to everyone who commented. I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it had and i've thuroughly enjoyed this discussion.	1
This is pretty much the way I thought for a long time until I got my fiancée an engagement ring. After doing lots of research I am extremely happy with my purchase of a diamond engagement ring. There are several reasons why to buy a diamond 1) The cartel has broken. You expressed some concern saying “I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren't rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market.” While that still is true to a certain extent the big cartel player (De Beers) has finally been broken. In 2000 producers in Russia, Canada and Australia decided to cut off channels to De Beers due to the negative publicity of “blood diamonds” and De Beers has been losing market share. De Beers’ market share fell from as high as 90% in the 1980s to less than 40% in 2012. In 2011 the Oppenheimer family announced their intention to sell the entirety of their 40% share. Price manipulation is now far more difficult. You could argue at this point in 2013, there is no manipulation and it is simply the market. 2) You’re not buying the rough diamond, you’re buying the art. Diamonds are expensive. I mean wtf they are just shiny hard pieces of carbon, I mean hell so is my ass. So why are they so expensive? It’s because of the art and skill it takes to cut a polish a rough diamond. These are skilled professionals who take years of training and experience to cut a rough diamond and actually make it look fantastic. Cut, the most important quality in my opinion, is almost entirely dependent on the skill of the diamond cutter. And even the carat is dependent on the diamond cutter not cutting too much. What this means of course is no diamond is the same. That may sound lame but it’s true. Small differences in facet pattern can produce large differences in the pattern of light that is reflected off the stone. Every diamond has its own “fire and brilliance” pattern. 3) The expense per day of use is very small. But diamonds are still expensive. I spent around $5000 for my engagement ring I gave to my fiancée, a lot right now, but she wears it every. single. day. And if we stay together for 50 years (perfectly reasonable considering our age) this means that the per day usage is $0.27! 4) There are alternatives to mined diamonds. Now you still may not like a mined diamond who knows maybe the store or website is lying and it is a blood diamond. I considered buying a synthetic diamond from a place like [here]( They use large pressure cookers to form real diamonds which are a little less expensive. I didn’t buy from them because they didn’t have the shape and style I was looking for and they aren’t that great at producing pure colorless yet. But they appear to be getting better and better. Of course they are about the same price for freaking carbon, but that’s because these diamonds still need to be cut by the same artists who cut earth-grown diamonds. Furthermore you could argue that the technology needed to make these is an art in itself. 5) You get enjoyment researching and every day she wears it. Finally it was fun looking all this up knowing that she will wear what I pick every single day. Sometimes I see the sparkle of the facet pattern when we are out at a restaurant and think of how I may know the facet pattern better than she does; I know why I chose a “modified brilliant cut” over an “old mine cut” and how it suits her and her personality. Sometimes while driving her I see some shimmer on the celling of the car and think about what that means; this stone, this diamond, on my fiancée’s finger, grew in the earth for perhaps millions of years at 1800 degrees to one day be blasted out of the earth through a volcano, to then be found, mined, cut, polished and finally purchased by me and given to my fiancée. Sometimes while on the couch with her, I see some reflection on the wall and I think of the sacrifice it took to mine, produce, and ship and the cost to me and I think that she is worth it. You get to be reminded almost every day what this person means to you and at $0.27 a day it’s a steal.	1
To be fair, I never thought I wanted a diamond engagement ring. When my then-girlfriend was considered proposing, she asked me what I wanted and what I cared about. The proposal itself had been expected, but I told her at the time I didn't know what I wanted and would need some time. She hated the idea of me not having something 'concrete', so we spent some time shopping around and finally found a Swarovski ring with the features that I liked. It cost us around 150USD, and I wear it everyday. It's much brighter than the diamond jewelry that I own, which were handmedowns from my mother. The problem is, even though it's brighter, it is not intended for everyday wear the same way a traditional diamond ring is. Engagement and wedding rings, by their very nature, are crafted to be durable and beautiful at the same time. My mother's wedding set was worn every day for 35 years before she passed away, and the ring itself was never dented or dinged. My ring, in comparison, shows obvious wear: the coating has chipped on the bottom from where it scratches against various surfaces, the small jewels on the band have fallen out (they've been replaced now, thankfully), and I have to polish it more often to retain the sparkle. While the concept of a diamond ring as a necessary gift for an engagement was certainly engineered by DeBeers as a marketing campaign, there's nothing *wrong* with wanting a ring. For me, a diamond ring is a tasteful, tangible way to display my love for my partner (and theirs for me). While I personally wouldn't opt for a larger than life multi-carat ring, I don't think there's anything wrong with someone whose taste leads them in that direction. When I do buy a ring, I know I'll buy a diamond ring. I won't be thrilled about the cost, but I also wasn't thrilled about buying a new car, or the cost to move across the country. But I know that every day that I look at it, I'll be reminded of the love and sacrifice my SO and I shared, and I won't regret it.	1
I don't think the Beatles were so great. CMV I mean, a lot of their songs are sort of catchy, but a lot of them I find are actually pretty terrible. A ton of them are formulaic as well, following basic song structures and chord progressions. Lyrics are rarely profound. I can see why people like them, but love for the Beatles is so disproportionately high compared to other British Invasion bands like the Who, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Clash, etc. Many of those bands innovated far more. I can also understand why they would have mass appeal, even today well after Beatlemania (and even with younger people). I get that. But I want someone to convince me why they are that much better, and why they deserve that excessive recognition.	0
The main problem with this reasoning is that you're looking at the Beatles from our current perspective as opposed to looking at what they did from the perspective of someone who was around at the time. Other posters have discussed the technical advancements they ushered in, so instead I will try to explain the cultural impact they've had. When the Beatles entered the scene (I wasn't around at the time, so this is taken from anecdotal evidence), much of the popular music was akin to what the Beatles released on Please Please Me, their first release. It was practically unheard of (at the time) for artists to progress the way that the Beatles did. Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time, while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs. There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both [I Wanna Hold Your Hand]( and [Tomorrow Never Knows]( very different songs, I admit, and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large) in a way that is...natural. They progressed as opposed to mutated. Along with that comes the fact that bands like Radiohead would not have existed at the time (that is to say, experimental bands that still achieved large mainstream appeal) and would arguably never had achieved mainstream success or even existed were it not for the Beatles. They are widely considered trailblazers in this regard exactly because they did go there and by doing so paved the way for other bands to do what they did, only more so. Finally, there has never been a band that has had as big a cultural impact before and since. People would maybe argue Elvis in America, but I would personally put the Beatles above that. The simple fact that female fans would have genuine [manic episodes]( just from seeing the Beatles (something that did not happen before) says a lot. I also did some research on the cultural impact the Beatles had on Liverpool and London, and it is remarkable. // Along with that comes that, if you look purely at the quality of music that the Beatles produced you should be able to see that they have produced an enormous amount of arguably high quality music in a short time. And the other bands know it too. The Who stated they were highly influenced by the Beatles (and the Beatles by them in return, just listen to [Helter Skelter]( and I would argue that you can definitely hear some Beatles influences in both Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, albeit more subtle. They were way before their time in a way that no other band has been able to emulate, be it in musical quality, diversity of material, evolution, quality and volume of music produced in a short timespan, and mass appeal. There has simply not been a band that has been able to deliver this complete package in the way that the Beatles did.	1
"Your main fallacy is the current perspective. You are listening to The Beatles after hearing thousands upon thousands of songs and bands that were influenced by their work (both directly and trickle-down). At the time in America chart-topping music was slow, boring, religious, safe, and fairly sterile ([check it)]( The Beatles were different and that's exactly what the youth of America was looking for. Did more talented artists exist... yep. Are The Beatles the most original band ever... nope. Does a lot of it amount to ""the right place at the right time""... yep. Are teenagers fickle and cling to popularity... super-yep. BUT... They kicked the door open for other (even better) bands to even exist. Nothing is original. We are telling the same basic stories in today's blockbuster films that we told each other in smoldering caves. Popular does not equal good. Good does not equal popular, but there is no denying the influence The Beatles have had over the past six decades. Greatness is defined by your mark on history, not necessarily your actual ability."	0
I believe that Marriage as a lifetime commitment is an outdated expectation. CMV I think that the Till Death Do You Part idea of marriage is simply not supported. Most marriages end in divorce anyway. In my own family, my great grand parents divorced, so did my grandparents and so did my parents. I don't know what should replace the lifetime commitment and expectation of monogamy of Marriage. This is an important question because I want to raise a kid someday. I believe the economic and financial stability of a two parent household is probably best for kids, but I have no interest in monogamy, nor could I ever pretend to believe I will want to be with the same person for my entire life. Edit: Oh, view changed, I have been away from reddit for a while.	1
"Remember that marriages are not necessarily monogamous. There are many shades of non monogamy. There is outright going against one partners wishes, there is one partner looking the other way but not wanting to know about it, there is a one way open marriage. Then there are couples where one of them is bi-sexual, whom might engage in non-monogamy with the same person, or they may just simply have an open relationship. Some marriages have nothing to do with sex. Or you get arrangements like these: Keeping what I said in mind, and not letting a lifetime of monogamy stop you, why is a lifelong commitment to another person troubling to you? Having someone to always have your back, to take care of you when you are sick, to enjoy good times together, to possibly raise offspring with... I agree that nobody should ""expect"" you to get married. But a lifelong commitment to another person can be incredibly positive if you choose the right person."	0
&gt; Most marriages end in divorce anyway. This is like the 5th time I've heard this in the past two days, and I don't know why people keep repeating it without checking their sources. This is not true. There was one study done over the course of one year that found there was one divorce for every two marriages. There were no follow up studies to confirm it the findings. It fails to take into account that people who divorce once are more likely to do so again in subsequent marriages. Based on this alone, the actual number is estimated to be 30 percent of people go through at least one divorce in their lifetime, but again that hasn't been empirically confirmed. And it also said nothing about the demographics of who is getting married or divorced. The couple getting married in vegas at 21 isn't going to have the same odds as the college graduate couple getting married at 28. There are a lot of factors to consider. It's not true that most marraiges end in divorce, and more importantly, most people who take their time in a relationship and treat it as the serious matter it is will not get divorced. &gt; In my own family, my great grand parents divorced, so did my grandparents and so did my parents. My parents are divorced, so were the parents of my two best friends growing up, and my wife's parents are not divorced but they don't' get along. And none of this matters, it's all anecdotal. When you look at the larger trends, most people don't get divorced. &gt; This is an important question because I want to raise a kid someday. I believe the economic and financial stability of a two parent household is probably best for kids, but I have no interest in monogamy, nor could I ever pretend to believe I will want to be with the same person for my entire life. This is where [opportunity cost]( comes in. Either you can raise kids in a stable, two parent household and spend ~18 years with the same person, or you can give up monogamy and be with lots of people. Neither of these is a bad option, but it's going to be very difficult to have both at the same time, and so you have to decide which is more important to you, and you may have to make sacrifices. You may find your priorities change as you get older.	1
"I believe that modern, mass media is biased, corrupt, and is only concerned with getting views. CMV It has always seemed to me that the media is only concerned with views rather than giving it's viewers the whole truth, or any truth at all. I believe their selection bias makes people think this world is an awful place because they only choose to show the horrible/disastrous things that happen in the world. I always read stories about how some poor man's car was stolen or how two neighbors had a disagreement got in a fight yesterday, yet I hardly ever read about a that car being found and returned to it's owner or a neighbor helping another neighbor out. I believe this is because the the ""happy"" stories aren't very exciting to read and don't get very many reads or views. This is why I believe modern mass media is completely corrupt. If it makes any difference, I am from California. I would love for this not be the case, so please change my view!"	1
"The problem isn't that the media wants ""views"". What else would media ever want? The only reason to broadcast *anything* is if you want a lot of people to see it. The problem, if it exists, would seem to be that the media wants to get *paid* for views. But that's been the model of media pretty much for as long as it has existed. Any time you get something for free on the internet, you are not the consumer, and what you're seeing is not the product. *You* are the product, and what you see is the means of production of that product. You get something nice, for free, because someone wants to pay someone else to buy your attention. And any problem we have with the media showing us what we want to see is a problem with *us*, not with the media. You're complaining about the wrong actor in this play."	0
I agree with a majority of what you said, but you said they are **only** concerned with views. When you make absolutes such as that you are likely wrong. Views is obviously an important factor. If you do not get many views you will have a hard time continuing. Without a large amount of viewers your ads will bring in less revenue and ultimately lower the profits of the company providing the news. This will possibly cause the company to go out of business or stop providing news. We can look at this regarding news casters on TV. It tends to be during the morning / afternoon it is more hard news while in the prime time there are more opinion shows. Why? Because people watch news more at night and they like bias and sensationalized news. If more people wanted hard news then there would be more hard news rather than opinion.	0
"I do not believe in the existence of a ""soul"" CMV While I think there are some arguments that make a compelling case for the possibility of God's existence I don't see the same as being true for the soul. The soul being some immortal, metaphysical, part of me that transcends death and more importantly that retains some form of identity. Once I die I don't think that there is any strong argument to claim that some aspect of me goes on living and that effects the world in any more meaningful way than the simple return of the elements of my makeup to the earth. This is my first post so if it is not quite to CMV's standards I apologize Thank you all so much for your replies, I wanted to make one clarification that what I am looking for is a strong inductive argument for a souls existence (or deductive but I don't think that's possible)."	0
"[Qualia]( Qualia are the highlights of conscious experience. The *experience* of the color red. The *pain* of a cut. The *sound* of a crash. I know that I *experience* these things. When I pinch my arm, my nervous system carries a signal to my brain that notifies it of the stimulus. But there is something additional: an actual experience of the pain. This experience is a quale. The philosopher David Chalmers has a thought-experiment that really highlights this, involving what he calls [philosophical zombies]( In short, imagine a world just like our own, down to every last quark and gluon. When you pinch me, I say ""Ow!"". I can sit and watch a sunset, and remark that the sky is purple. But unlike our world, in this new world I never actually *experience* anything. This seems totally possible. After all, reacting to a pinch only requires the transmission of the stimulus to the brain, not a conscious experience. So his argument is this: Let's suppose that the physical description of our world accounts for everything. This view is called *physicalism*, and though you didn't explicitly endorse it in your post, it is quite likely similar to the opinion you seem to hold. [Wikipedia]( has a more thorough form of the argument, if you are interested. So now we have two worlds that are physically identical, down to every last detail. But in one world, we have conscious experience, and in the other we don't. So it cannot possibly be that the physical description of the world accounts for everything in it: for one, it doesn't account for consciousness. Thus physicalism must be false. This argument is logically valid, but some people take issue with some of the premises. For one, it is possible that a complete physical description of the world *would* account for consciousness, therefore it would be logically impossible for an exact physical clone of our universe to be missing conscious experience. Much has been written about this specific argument, both in favor and in opposition. I'd like to return, though, to qualia. Any worldview has to account for qualia. For entirely physical worldviews, this means that qualia ultimately are physical. There are some famous arguments, however, that try and show that this cannot be so. One such is the [knowledge argument]( Here is one form by Frank Jackson: &gt; Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like ‘red’, ‘blue’, and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ‘The sky is blue’. [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not? One might say that she *does* learn something: what the actual experience of the color blue is. Therefore, since she had a complete physical knowledge of the color blue, but still learned something about blue: she learned something non-physical. So, back to souls. Does any of this offer any support for the classicial notion of a soul, where after one dies he goes to heaven to spend eternity with Grandma and Grandpa, swimming in rivers of milk and honey? Of course not. It doesn't even say much about personal identity. These arguments only support the notion that our conscious experience cannot be fully explained by a physicalist worldview. I've quoted Schrodinger in another reply, because he was such a colorful guy, and I'll conclude with another quote of his: &gt; The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so. Personally, as a philosophical lay-person, I'm swayed by these arguments. I have read many counters to them, but none of them have particularly resonated with me. On the other hand, I can imagine someone coming to the opposite conclusion: that all of the talk about qualia and philsophical zombies amounts to sweeping what we don't quite understand under a rug and calling it magic. I hope, however, that I've shown that there is something of a debate to be had about consciousness. This debate has very little to say about what we would normally call a ""soul"", but if we water-down the definition to basically mean ""something apart from our physical brain"", then one might be able to make a case."	1
"Sorry, but you *do* believe in a soul, and here's why. Imagine the world after your death. What do you see? You might imagine people at your funeral, or other people in the world going about their business after you've passed away. But here's the thing: you still imagined *yourself seeing it*. You imagined your consciousness, existing in a metaphysical state after your body had gone. Now, you could argue, ""But I imagined my *present* consciousness looking at *future* events!"" It doesn't matter. For a true materialist, imagining an overlap between your own perception and the absence of your body should be impossible, like asking a person to imagine being blind and seeing the color red. Your mind can't wrap itself around that concept. But your mind can easily wrap itself around the concept of your consciousness existing without your body. That's because deep down, you really believe that your consciousness is a *thing* in and of itself, not a process or a function of your physical form. And if you believe your consciousness is a separate thing, then you believe that your perception of the world comes from a metaphysical entity which could, in theory, survive the destruction of your physical body. In other words, a soul. Now, what you *don't* believe is that *other people* have souls. It's easy to imagine a world without other people. But you believe that you have one, because everything you imagine has to pass through the filter of your own perception, even the imagining of your own death."	0
I feel that high-end luxury cars (Bentley, Rolls Royce, etc.) are a complete and utter scam. CMV For about $50k, you can get a car with a fairly powerful motor and a nice interior. Getting up to the $100k range, you get a very strong motor and a nice interior. However, I'm unable to understand the appeal of paying $500k or more for a car that, most likely, performs the same as a $50k car. When I look at luxury cars, I see...tan/cream-colored leather interior, a powerful motor, and that's it. I'm guessing that you're paying mostly for the little sticker that says the name of the car manufacturer instead of any actual benefit to the car. It could be the fact that I don't judge my worth by the things that I own, and I'm unable to understand the idea behind it. I imagine that lower-end Cadillacs and Buicks probably perform the same function at roughly a tenth of the price.	0
What you're saying is that there's basically no tangible difference between a $100,000 luxury car and a Rolls Royce/Bentley. I'm no expert, but my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made. Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted. And as a result of all this, not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher. The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4-door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0-60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k. I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less. For people who have many millions (or billions) of dollars, the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal, and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car. Sometimes they just like to own a unique item, but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes. If the car helps you to secure a billion dollar deal, it was a good investment. edit: typo	1
"How are they ""a complete and utter scam""? Who are getting conned? The producers are offering a product that they make, for a price that they set. The consumer are usually well aware of the huge markup vs the difference in performance, and they are paying for the brand, which is their conscious decision. Those who buy these luxury cars are (usually) people who can afford that extra luxury of having either a social status symbol like the Bentley or the Maserati. They know exactly what they are doing when they are buying the car, and they are fully aware of the fact that they are paying for a brand name."	0
I believe people should be given psychoactive drugs that increases their productivity, like stimulants (Adderall, etc). CMV Apparently my original account got shadowbanned or something, so asking again: I remember seeing some posts in askreddit about ADHD medications, and I was amazed when people mentioned how they were able to get motivated and focus on many activities for hours they would otherwise find boring and soon quit, like studying or just trying to learn certain topics. I think one person read about how mechanical clocks worked and designed one for himself while on the drugs. Based on these evidences I think they can be used to make people learn more, like in schools and many other possible environments. And if people know more and are motivated to something productive this will likely lead to better society in general. I do realize potential side effects these drugs can bring, and how they can fuck people up both mentally physically if abused. Governmental regulation on usage of these drugs and help to people will help decrease these disastrous outcomes.	1
I think what you're forgetting here is the possibility of dependence. Some people with ADHD don't take these medications specifically because they've already developed coping mechanisms to help increase their productivity. If you start on these meds young, these mechanisms never develop. This means that if they go off meds, they lose all productivity. Now a second thing to consider is this: due to the way that adderall and other stimulants interact with the brain, they create a dependency. As part of that dependency, the receptors in the the synapse get saturated, and are removed due to their redundancy. This essentially means that if you don't have ADHD and are on these drugs, you will get ADHD. So now assuming that we can supply the entire country with stimulants (which I imagine our current industry couldn't handle), once they become dependent, they essentially turn from super productive to regularly productive people, unless you increase the dosage. And if there is any sort of disruption in the supplytrain, like a natural disaster, or other problems, you suddenly have a nation of people who have severe ADHD, and have no idea how to deal with it because they haven't spent the past 30 years learning how to deal with it. If you need an analogy think of coffee. Coffee has a stimulant that people use to be more productive, and a lot of people drink it everyday. But when someone doesn't get their morning cuppa, or misses a day, they can go into withdrawal, being cranky and tired, and most likely unproductive. You say that government regulation will help, but what do you propose? Already there is an underground market for these drugs. Do you propose limiting the amount one person can buy? Then there are proxy buyers willing to sell. There will always be a way around the system. Now compared with those side effects, do we really think that the trade off for a little more productivity is worth it?	0
People shouldn't be given these drugs at all. If they want to use them, they should have to buy them. There is no reason the government should give people psychoactive drugs and there is no way we could afford them as is. The cost to medicate the entire US with adderall for a year, assuming a population of 313.9 million people taking one 20mg tablet given to them in packs of 60, which would be enough for two months, would cost over 103 billion dollars at the current market price of around 55 dollars per 60 20 mg tablets. Now eventually, this would wear off and the 20mg adderall would not be enough to give the same effects so we might bump the dosage to 30 mg and then bump it further to 40 mg tablets and since I'm not a doctor or somebody qualified, I couldn't tell you where that ends. The costs are utterly ridiculous and I don't think we would see a growth in tax revenue that would allow us to recoup our losses. Furthermore, there are some risks involved with adderall that could boost the cost of our healthcare across the country, and also the level of accidental death due to an adderall overdose. There are simply too many variables involved in giving people these drugs. However I would not discourage the purchase of these drugs by people willing to put their own money towards them as I support the legalization of all illegal and prescription drugs and their purchase without a prescription.	0
I believe scientific reasoning is the best way to collectively know reality, understand the natural world, and gain empirical knowledge. For clarification, I'm speaking of contemporary scientific reasoning.	0
*Devil's Advicate* [Here]( is a link to Paul Feyerabend's *Against Method* in which he argues against the current model of the scientific method. I suggest starting on page 9 as it is most pertinent to what you're talking about. To summarize for the lazy/don't have time: Feyerabend argues that the scientific methodology is too constrictive to the pursuit of knowledge. Many great discoveries have been by accident or have ignored the scientific method to reach a goal. Additionally, you fail to realize that science is not merely a tool, but instead is influenced by human biases and expectations. Science education, for example, is taught outside the context of history (mostly, some teachers will throw in the context) and philosophy (i.e. metaphysics). Epistemology isn't taught when pursuing a science degree in the university unless the student branches out. And as [u/pezz29]( points out, how can you really know what you know if you don't understand what knowledge is? The scientific method is the best way of attaining knowledge we've got right now. But the same can be said about religion in the past, and look how ~~reddit~~ ~~scientists~~ some people view religion. TLDR: The scientific method is constrictive and doesn't account for many factors in its pursuit of knowledge or in how we educate, as well as other stuff i didn't go into.	0
"Disclaimer: I generally agree with OP but am playing devil's advocate. The problem with this is that there is an (mostly Western) expectation of education and an underlying tone of progressionism. While there are some people who instinctively follow a ""scientific model"" throughout their life - hypothesis, testing, learning from experience - I would argue that the rate of people who do this is much higher among educated and Westernized people than, say, a farmer in Africa who did not have a chance at an education. Additionally, this idea promotes the concept that you are moving forward by gathering information. However, what about knowledge that cannot be gathered through empiricism? We shouldn't all have to become meth addicts, or know/observe meth addicts to how bad the drug can be to us. Can we not learn through parable? What if this information/experiment is more damaging to you than beneficial? What about your own subjective view that coats the whole experience? I'm going to go all Buddhist on you here and argue that the best way to know reality is to know yourself - through meditation, knowing your body, and self-analysis of any kind. By knowing yourself, you can remove yourself as much as possible from the equation of life (view your experiences with the knowledge that you feel X way because you are Y or feel Z) and have a more genuine, truthful view - that's reality: no self."	0
I don't think religious reasons are valid, for anything really, because religions are not based on reason. CMV A few premises so that people can discuss specific points: Most religions are based on faith. [Faith]( is not based on reason. Therefore most religions are not based on reason. So for someone to say they hold a particular view or want to do a certain thing for religious reasons is misleading because it's not because of 'reasons' that they hold that view but because of something else entirely, usually because they have faith in something, which by it's definition isn't reasonable. Whether or not we should have reasons behind our beliefs is entirely different, I just don't think there are such things as 'religious reasons'. Have fun.	0
"&gt; [rea·son]( &gt; 1. a basis or cause, as for some belief, action, fact, event, etc.: the reason for declaring war. &gt; 2. a statement presented in justification or explanation of a belief or action. &gt; 3. the mental powers concerned with forming conclusions, judgments, or inferences. &gt; 4. sound judgment; good sense. In definitions one and two if someone's belief in a religion causes them to do or believe in something they are doing it for a religious reason because their religion is the cause and used as justification. In definition three if they apply their religious system of belief to conclude, judge, or infer something, they are using religious reasoning. For definition four, if their are no logical inconsistencies between the person holding a view or doing something and their religious system of belief they are using religious reason. Faith in god may be a basic assumption of most religions but off of that assumption is a myriad of reasoning. And the basic assumption doesn't necessarily make it ""bad"" or illogical reasoning either, as all reasoning processes make basic assumptions."	0
"You're argument is basically one of semantics. I mean, I could say ""My religion caused me to do X"" or I could say ""I did X for a religious reason"". I'm saying literally exactly the same thing, but only the second doesn't work in your opinion? Maybe, a better way or saying it would be that you don't think religion or faith should be used as evidence for an assertion. That means something quite different than what your post entails, but it would probably be more accurate."	0
"I don't think that any social drinking (alcohol) is justifiable. CMV I am unaware of any positive effects of drinking alcohol even as a social lubricant. At various levels of intoxication, it lowers inhibition, reaction time, focus, vision, and decision-making capability. I put more emphasis on the last one listed, decision-making, since the lack of judgement due to alcohol is what causes many of the anecdotal mistakes I have read/heard. Therefore, I find it baffling that anyone would consciously choose to drink alcohol for any reason any other drink (or even any other ""action"") could also fill."	0
"The fundamental flaw with your reasoning is that you assume that an action has to be justified. Do I also have to justify my love of pepperoni pizza? How about my coffee in the morning? Do I have to justify buying a BMW because, ""I find it baffling that anyone would consciously choose to ~~drink alcohol~~ buy a BMW for any reason any other ~~drink~~ car could also fill.""? Certainly not. If that were true, then I could likewise make you justify your decision *not* to drink. Alcohol is a dangerous drug if it's abused. It certainly can lead people to make poor decisions, and can even lead to death. It appears that what you have an issue with is alcoholism or binge drinking, not drinking alcohol itself. The two are very different. As with many things, moderation is the key. Personally, I don't drink very often - maybe once a month. I enjoy the taste of a finely blended whisky or a very old Scotch. Your statement that any other drink or any other action could fill the same purpose as a glass of The Glenlivet 18 year is simply untrue. The key is to drink responsibly. You control the drink, don't let the drink control you. If you can't do that, then you're not mature enough to drink."	1
Having fun. I know it's cliche but it's true, some people have fun while drinking, and it is partly due to the drinking. For example, if you go to a club sober you might be a bit self-conscious but if you drink you might not be, and then you'll be able to enjoy yourself more.	0
No one should personally own a car or other motor vehicles CMV Basically you can(/should be able to) cycle or get public transport to shops and places of work. If you get a job far away you should move house or you will be provided a company car. Cars and vans will still be available for hire so people can go on holidays or for moving house. **V been C'd, please don't waste your time, unless you really want to, it's a free internet.**	0
&gt; Basically you can(/should be able to) cycle That doesn't work in all climates. If you lived in a very cold or very warm place, you you wouldn't want to cycle. &gt; or get public transport to shops and places of work. Public transport takes ages to get to the same place you're going to, and it often doesn't take you there directly, but through many intermediate steps. Furthermore, it doesn't take you there where you need to go, but it takes you more or less in the vicinity. Granted, if what you propose were ever to become a reality, the network of public transport would become more extended, but I still doubt that it would be extended enough to provide a viable alternative. And what should the elderly and people with disabilities do, when the bus drops them three blocks away from where they need to be? Plus don't forget that not everyone lives in a city, and a bus cannot go to and from a country town every ten minutes. That would greatly limit the possibility of movement of people living in towns and villages.	0
You cannot cycle or get public transport in rural areas. What you are advocating would shift all people to living in the city which is not practical or affordable for many people. I grew up in the country 30 miles from the nearest town where there is no public transportation. My family was not wealthy enough to just buy a new house in some city. We also would not have been able to keep our animals in the city. What do you propose that farmers do? You're most likely not going to be able to put a 20 acre farm anywhere that has decent public transportation. Do you consider the family farmer a company? If not, and they should not own cars, how do you expect them to transport their produce to the market? I live in a city now, and I cannot even take public transportation because they have trimmed the budget and cut all the bus lines. Cycling is not practical in the snow. There is no way I could get to work without a car. At one point, I moved somewhere with the sole purpose of not having to drive anywhere and taking public transportation everywhere, but then the line I took was cut back making it impossible for me to use public transportation. The city also had no way to enter on foot or on a bicycle. You had to be in a motor vehicle. You are also expecting companies that won't even fork over the cash to pay decent living wages or buy employees health insurance to buy cars for their employees. That is not going to happen. Wal-Mart and Papa Johns will force cash strapped communities to pay to transport their employees to work. This response isn't even taking into consideration those individuals with physical disabilities that cannot be expected to ride a bicycle to work. I'd like to know where you live if you think public transportation and cycling only would enable you to get to your desired expectations.	1
I believe attempted murder and murder should be treated as the same crime. CMV hypthetical: Someone makes me mad. I bring a gun to their house, and attempt to shoot them. This creates two scenarios: one where I shoot them in the head, killing them, and serve twenty years in jail. In the second I narrowly miss them, they call the cops, I'm arrested, and serve five. If the intent is the same, why should failed murder attempts be treated lesser than successful ones?	0
Having a lesser punishment for attempted murder incentivizes would-be murderers in the middle of carrying out their plans from following through because they know the punishment will be greatly reduced if they restrain themselves in the very end and don't actually kill someone. Also attempted murder is a much harder crime to prove definitively than actual murder because it is difficult to definitively tell if someone was trying to kill a person or simply harm them. Both are bad but a less severe crime should have a less severe punishment and since it is less clear with attempted murder that the person wanted someone dead the punishment is less severe.	0
Interesting. Well legally the penalty for anything that does actual harm is much more severe, for example DUI vs impaired driving causing death. But you present an interesting case. If I were a judge, I would justify the position by saying it's impossible to tell just how dead set a person was on killing another. It's entirely possible that something within you made the conscious decision at the last second to tilt your gun a little too high, and miss him. I believe that the Law would like to assume that nobody is inherently evil and that the difference between a failed murder and a successful one is one of character and restraint. Of course this isn't always the case, but you can see that when sentencing, a justice would prefer to have mercy on someone who went into that house intending to kill a man, but decided not to when push came to shove.	0
"I am an existential nihilist. CMV To avoid confusion I'd like to define the term existential nihilism as the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or purpose, and nothing that anybody does (or that the human race does as a whole) will matter at all in the long run. Note that, based on this definition, changing my view on only one of the two qualifiers would change my opinion on the matter, as existential nihilism requires both to be true. At the same time, though, when I say ""nothing will matter at all in the long run"" I'm not talking about the differences that humanity will cause in terms of releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or something of similar vein. I mean that humanity will never accomplish a worthwhile goal, one that will result in life having reached its predetermined objective or have truly 'succeeded' in any way. Edit: I just checked the thread after waking up, at 8:00 a.m EST, and it's jumped from 4 comments to 20. I've gotta leave for school right now, but I'll reply to the comments once I get home (around 3:30 EST)"	0
So far as we can currently understand, all life is cancer; self-perpetuating simply because it does. My argument against absolute certainty in existential nihilism is the belief that increasingly novel arrangements of materials and ideas represent the only kind of progress that is *potentially* meaningful to intelligent beings. If there really exists any 'meaning' behind intelligent life, all previous formations of human society and ideas produced have not found it. Thus, *meaningful* progress if there is any to be had, can only be found in directions unexplored. Forward advancements in science encapsulate all past scientific knowledge. Forward advancements in technology obsolete all past related-technologies. Forward development of moral valuations invalidate all past systems of morality. So long as it does exist, humanity's only legitimate goal is to build on upon everything 'previous' in order to accomplish novel progress. An intelligent mind sees no other alternative. Future formations of human life and intelligence can only be *potentially* meaningful so long as they are different than all that came before. Given the choice between zero and infinity, aim for infinity - even if infinity is incomprehensible. You and I already understand the meaning of zero, so why waste time on that?	0
"I mean that humanity will never accomplish a worthwhile goal, one that will result in life having reached its predetermined objective or have truly 'succeeded' in any way. -The predetermined objective of life is to reproduce and in doing so you ""succeed"" as far as evolution is concerned at least."	0
"Can't find the source right now, but I've seen a couple of studies that indicate that people prefer to think that there's somebody in charge and they are evil rather than think nobody is in charge. If there is somebody in charge, you can blame that somebody for the evils of the world. ""No way a lone gunman could kill a president, there must be some shadow organization behind it!"". The truth is, nobody is in charge, and nobody knows what they are doing, everyone is making it up as they go along. Scarier is that our current social structure is built on the premise that we should keep it, nothing more. As we can see clearly from the arab sprint, our social order is highly fragile and can crumble easily to the slightest of provocations. It's much more comforting to most people to think that there's some big evil order imposed from above (be it god or a shadow government) than to face the fact that the world is random, the world is unjust, and nobody holds control over it, it's all just one big mess. Nobody in the ""higher ups"" decides that a president should be killed or some buildings should be destroyed, lone crazies do it, and in some cases other people fail to stop them. As comforting as it is to think that somebody is in charge, and he has a (however evil) plan for us, that's not the case in reality, there's no plan, there's no order, there's no justice, there's no right and wrong, there is complete chaos. If that sounded too scary for you to comprehend, don't blame people who just can't comprehend that and insist to believe in some higher order, even in an evil one, because even an evil order is better than pure chaos, to some people."	1
"I think it's fair to say there are genuine conspiracies in the world. Powerful people do in fact conspire to gain power and money. But the difference between ""most"" conspiracy theories and legitimate ones (Watergate, etc.) is standard of evidence. Most conspiracy theorists come up with their theories in a self-sealing way, such that they cannot be disconfirmed. Any evidence they find contradicting the idea can be easily dismissed as propaganda by the conspirators or incorporated into their alternate reality narrative. [This article]( discusses a group of scientists who had the opportunity to study conspiracy theories forming in real time. You can see the flaws in reasoning and immunity to falsification conspiracy theories suffer from. I guess it's possible that through flawed reasoning and inconsistent standards of evidence that most conspiracy theorists have stumbled upon the truth merely by chance, but that seems implausible. The best way will always be to examine the actual facts with each theory. What do we find out when we consider all objections? The Moon Landing was not faked. Vaccines do not cause autism. Aliens didn't land at Roswell. Elvis is dead."	0
I believe that cheating is acceptable in the high stress environment that students are placed in today because of higher requirements for entry to college and more and more pressure from society. CMV I am a senior in high school, and while I dont cheat, I can see why people do it and I don't really have a problem with it. I live in California, and the kids at my school take 5-6 AP classes junior year and senior year. They pay large amounts of money for SAT prep classes, and other resources like this. When every kid at your school is so far ahead, an average student who works hard to get B's is left behind and can't keep up. So they might resort to cheating to keep up with them. And I feel that this is justified because it can be really unfair for those who work their asses off to get that B, only to have their application to a better college rejected because people keep pushing this envelope of cramming more and more AP classes into their schedule. So when it comes down to it in my opinion, when someone's hardest and best effort wont get them somewhere because of the unfair competition they face, cheating is justified. thanks in advance for your replies! Edit: I also just realized that this may seem an immature position because I'm a high school senior-but I hope to get some good discussion about this! Thanks again	1
"Why should an ""average student who works hard to get B's"" get the same future as people who do well in 5-6 AP classes? If someone has the ability to achieve in a high-stress environment, he is rewarded for it. Why should someone be rewarded for something they aren't able to do?"	0
Rather than propping up a corrupt and unjust system that will only get worse with time, students who scholastically deserve what they're not getting should be working to expose the cheating of those who rob them of their future. By capitulating to the broken system, they allow the entrants to universities to be diluted by cheaters who can't do the work. While the short-term gains to the student may seem justifiable, essentially, the cost is far higher... intelligent students should be able to see that.	0
I think GMO's are not only safe, but that the controversy surrounding them is largely conspiracy nonsense fueled by anger at Monsanto's business practices. CMV? Humans have been adapting the food we grow for as long as we've had the slightest knowledge of genetics. Everything from gene manipulation to selective breeding is a type of genetic modification, meaning it's difficult if not impossible to buy any food humans haven't modified genetically to fit our needs. I can't help but feel that the bad press surrounding genetically modified food (or more accurately, food that has had its genes artificially manipulated in the lab, since that's the only type of GMO anyone seems to care about) is borne of foodies and conspiracy nuts, and fanned by everyone's hatred of Monsanto for their (admittedly terrible) business practices. What don't I know that I should about this?	0
Just because the bad feelings are fueled by anger at Monsanto doesn't mean it is conspiracy nonsense. Genetic modification is not bad in and of itself. It actually works to strengthen crops and make them better for us. But the effects of widespread uniform use of GMOs are ultimately unsafe. Monsanto's practices (and genetic engineering in general) reduce biodiversity which leads to a very unstable system, where a single disease can immediately kill off all the crops everywhere or any change in climate could have disastrous effects. If you're growing crops you want to use the best genes that have been created. You aren't going to grow a sub-par version just so biodiversity doesn't take a hit. But when everyone does that, then we have a huge food crisis waiting to happen. Genetic engineering strengthens the individual parts but weakens the whole.	0
"I think a key to your argument is that human-promoted natural breeding is the same as genetic engineering by unnatural methods like physically inserting a foreign gene in a way that would never happen by accident. I don't think they're that comparable: 1. **GMO makes more changes happen faster.** This is why it's valuable. Some changes, like [glowing pigs]( may be pretty much impossible to selectively breed for because nothing like it exists already, but can be done by injecting genes in a way that would never happen naturally. Great for getting good things to happen faster, but it can also make bad things happen faster too. 2. **Faster, more drastic change is more dangerous.** This is simply common sense. Would you rather eat the slightly redder tomato that has existed and been eaten in small numbers for centuries, but has been selectively bred to be more common; or the cool glowing tomato that was created in a lab last month and has never been tried by anyone? Basically, the ""guinea pig"" factor is much higher with GMO foods."	0
I think that charging different demographics different rates on car insurance is unjust. CMV. As an 18 year old guy, I get charged an astronomical rate for car insurance. I am a conscientious and safe driver and have never gotten a ticket or gotten in an accident. I don't think it's fair to make me pay significantly more money than other people just because of my age. I understand that young men are the most likely demographic to get into an accident, but that does not warrant discriminating against every individual in the group. We understand that a cop treating a black man differently than a white man is wrong, even though the black man has a statistically higher chance of committing a crime than a white man in many areas. I believe this logic should be applied to insurance rates. Anyway, CMV.	1
"&gt; but that does not warrant discriminating against every individual in the group. Rather than looking at it as discrimination, I want to illustrate that it's part of an elaborate game. To try to change your view, I want to start with a casino. Ultimately, a casino is taking a risk with every bet it takes; it has to handle the possibility to paying out each and every time. To minimize the risk, the ""house"" has a hierarchy of wagers, so that bets with a low-risk of paying out require less initial investment than those with a higher risk of paying out. Consider the roulette wheel. Because the odds that the result will be ""red"" just under half the time, such bets are relatively risky for the house. To keep from losing all their money, they are going to make sure that the payout on that is relatively low: 1 dollar gets you 2. On the other hand, anyone picking a single number has a low chance of winning, so that is a lower risk for the house. They can offer a return of 36 times the bet because the chances that they'll have to pay are really low. If a casino offered 36:1 returns on a 50-50 bet, they wouldn't be in business for long. Now, think of insurance as organized gambling. When you take out an auto policy, you are basically wagering that you are going to get into an accident someday. Meanwhile, the ""house,"" or the insurance company, is wagering that you won't. In order to stay in business, then, the insurance company has to make sure that the odds aren't stacked against them. For young men under the age of 25, statistically that's akin to the ""red-black"" bet on a roulette wheel; a very risky wager. Thus they aren't going to give big payouts unless the initial investment is high. Meanwhile, those demos with statistically lower risks wouldn't have to spend as much to ""play"" because the insurance company knows that the chances they'll have to pay out are slim. The alternative would be that all payouts would be of the ""red-black"" variety, because otherwise, the insurance company wouldn't be able to stay in business if it offered the low-investment/high-return bet for everyone. Like the casino giving 36:1 on every bet, an insurance company wouldn't stay in business for long offering the same rates/wagers to everyone. TL,DR: Insurance is organized gambling, and demographics are the spaces on a roulette wheel; not everything is going to pay out the same."	0
This one is actually pretty simple. If insurance companies couldn't discriminate based on things like age for drivers, they just wouldn't insure those higher risk groups. If they had to charge the same rate for 18 year old's as they did for 40 year old's, they would lose money on that age group. What's the point of being in the business of insuring people if you're going to lose money doing it? Insurance companies aren't charities. Even though you may individually be a good driver, there is no way for a company to ascertain that. All they can measure is the group's statistics, and unfortunately that's where your peer group screws you. One other point: there is nothing about blackness that says anything about whether you will be a criminal or not. There are things like poverty and lack of education (unfortunately related to being black in America) that influence criminality, and that's why you might say a black man has a statistically higher chance of committing a crime in certain areas. The cause isn't because a person is black or white though. Being young ,however, does have a direct impact on how good a driver you are likely to be though, due to the way the brain develops.	0
"Vaccinations should be compulsory for all persons living in my society (USA, but applicable to all western countries). religious reasons should not be acceptable reasons to get out of it. CMV Vaccinations prevent diseases, period. They protect not only the person receiving them, but also those who are unable to receive them. This is what is referred to as the ""Herd Immunity."" If you are not vaccinated, but you never come into contact with someone else who is not vaccinated, then you are given a sort of protection by eliminating your own exposure. **Those who have a religious or ideological opposition to vaccination are therefore partially protected, despite their own opposition to the practice,** and should not be permitted this protection by being present in a society that has taken the effort to vaccinate them. The only excuse I am ready to accept without argument is a medical excuse for vaccination: If a vaccination will cause injury to an individual due to allergies or immune deficiency, then they should be exempt. Change my View. **∆ and Clarifications**: The specific vaccines I feel should be ""compulsory"" are those that are approved by a panel of experts on the subjects (from Immunology, epidemiology, virology, microbiology, etc), but I expect these would include childhood vaccines TDaP, MMR, Hep B, MCV4, IPV, Varicella, and before long the HPV vaccine. Criteria should include: Severity of associated disease, and record of safety during optional vaccination period. All vaccines should be provided at no cost through some governmental or insurance program. Any medically sound excuse, including but not limited to allergies, immunodeficiency, guillan barre syndrome, etc should be valid to excuse an individual from receiving a vaccine, as it would be unsafe for them to receive it. This does not excuse religious exemptions. Many of you have made the argument that you cannot force a person to get an injection/put something in their body, and I do find that argument compelling. I would be open to a more stringent application of existing rules: 1. All children must be vaccinated in order to attend any school or daycare. 2. Parents who wish to homeschool their children must complete an education course on vaccination and pass an exam on how vaccines work, or have their children vaccinated. 3. Adults must provide prospective employers with a letter from a doctor indicating that they are vaccine compliant (ie, have been vaccinated or have a medically recognized reason for not being vaccinated), or the employer may choose not to hire them due to their failure to get vaccinated. 4. No federal agency will accept an application without a doctor's letter indicating vaccine compliance. 5. Doctor's letter of Vaccine Compliance is also required for a driver's license, but not for a passport. It is required for re-entry to the country. Edit: Thanks everyone! I will write more replies later, but I have a proposal due on my influenza vaccine research tomorrow, and I need to get my ass back to work."	0
The best argument against forcing immunizations is respect for autonomy when it comes to medical procedures. Also, force is not always the best solution, take sanctions against drugs, or alcohol (in the past) etc. Now compare tobacco smoking - education (and higher taxes) have done wonders to lower the number of smokers. It seems to me that better information and education for anti-vaxxers would go a lot further. I think spreading good information has a better impact anyway, people understanding *why* it is necessary and beneficial.	0
There are communities who have religious opposition to vaccines have had those beliefs for hundreds of years, and the diseases have been stopped just fine without forcing them to violate their religious beliefs and violating their first amendment rights in the process. I'm with you that people with ideological opposition are idiots who shouldn't be allowed to place their children in harms way because a brother of a friend of a friend of a friend totally got the autism from a vaccine and Jenny McCarthy swears it's a conspiracy, but people with religious reasons have had them for a lot longer than the current problem, and are few enough in number that it doesn't affect herd immunity.	0
I believe allowing unrelated topics to be part of the same bill is damaging to the legislative process. CMV It is a common practice in the introduction of legeslation to include completely unrelated issues in an attempt to get them passed as part of the main issue. For example, one party might want to pass law A, but not law B. A second party wants to pass lab B, but not law A. So when the first part introduces a bill on law A the second party will tack on law B in hopes that the first wants law A to pass so badly that they'll be willing to allow law B to slip through. A recent example was anti abortion legislation being grouped in with motorcycle safety laws. I find this disruptive to the process. By forcing politicians to weigh the merits of completely unrelated issues against each other, the consideration given to individual issues is diluted and good laws get shot down to avoid the passing of bad, or vise versa. Change My View. **EDIT:** My view has been changed. Thanks to /u/thedeeno for pointing out that this is how minority interests get their views noticed and pushed through despite little interest. Also to /u/floorberry for pointing out that this is a way to get around using a LOT of time on small and (to the greater body) unimportant topics such as relatively small allocations for infrastructure upkeep. /u/treseritops made a similar point very well. Also, thanks to /u/auandi for pointing out that the House *already* has a rule against this, but it's effectively castrated by the normal political structure.	0
It's actually beneficial: This is how minority interests get things done. Ignoring the practical problems that arise when we start creating arbitrary issue boundaries, a system where every issue is segmented would be a system dominated by majority interests and also a system where negotiating is severely limited. For instance, suppose a few states live in a particularly dry region of the country. These states might have a minority interest in, say, fresh water delivery systems. Suppose they need to build a new one. Answer this for yourself: Why would the majority fund a project like this? 1. Because they are generous? 2. Because it's the right thing to do? 3. Because they can get something in exchange? By allowing 'unrelated' issues into bills, we give this minority interest leverage at the negotiating table. They can effectively say: we can't support your bill unless we get traction on our issue as well. In addition, by giving them a stake at the table, we can make our bill, which may otherwise be irrelevant to the minority, something worth taking action on. Now this does NOT mean dry-state representatives can SAFELY vote NO on a bill when they don't get traction on their issue. A vote is a constantly evolving negotiation, where the public perception, public desire, majority interest, and minority interest are constantly balancing. Allowing bills to be open documents maximizes the issues that get weighed into this calculation. I think this is a good thing - even though is may be frustrating when your issue is blocked by some other interest. **tldnr;** unrelated topics increase the leverage of minority interests and makes the original bill appealing to more counter parties.	0
The allowance of amendments isn't the problem in the US political system. Amendments play a valuable role in legislation, and they can improve many laws. The problem is that the politicians involved choose to include unrelated things and their peers don't vote that shit down as stupid and unrelated. Congress doesn't need to pass bills that are hundreds of pages long that none of the reps have read before they vote. They don't need to accept amendments that aren't germane to the issue. They are making a choice to validate this behavior and to make laws in this way. It's not the fault of the process. It's the fault of the people involved in it, and it's the fault of voters for putting up with that shit for years and years.	0
"[CMV] I believe the reality around me does not exist, and there is no way to prove it does I'm convinced that it's not possible to rely on the world around me to be real and that there is no way to prove it to me. An extension of that is that I feel like there is no way to actually know anything whatsoever. From math to physics and chemistry, every science has holes in it and they depend on big assumptions about reality that cannot ever doubted, otherwise the whole system falls over. For example, mathematics, being one of the most fundamental basis of our perception of the world, depends on axioms and postulates that boil down to ""Been tested a ton of times, makes sense in our heads"" for even the simplest statements of x=x. Or that 1+1 = 2 because we've never encountered a situation where this was not true. Anything as fundamental as that, and just the whole knowledge of human biology where the brain depends on outside input to judge its environment and ""prove"" reality to itself seems utterly flawed. Think about it. I don't know if what I see in front of me is actually there. I don't know if the people I talk to are real. How can they even prove it to me? Furthering that, some movies even expressly touch these tenets like The Matrix, Total Recall, and even Inception. I am utterly, without a doubt, convinced of this, live my life according to this belief. **EDIT**: [Delta]("	0
You say that there is no way to know anything. But how can you know that, really? Couldn't you stumble across a way to know things some day? You can say that you know nothing at the moment, but to say that you never knew anything, or that you will never know anything, seems awfully overconfident. So, if there is no need for the situation to remain as it is, then searching for a way to change the situation may be valid. Also, we regularly make actions based on knowledge and logic (I need to eat, you need to eat), so even if you don't believe in logic, you had better act as if you do. A minor quibble: The logic of an argument is independent of the people speaking it. If an argument just popped out of the ether, that wouldn't make it any less valid than if it came out of a person.	0
How exactly do you live your life according to that belief? Remember that one of the core aspects of science is that it never considers itself to be definitively correct about something. It only tries to provide evidence as to what is most probable to be correct at the moment. The scientific foundation was laid by people who had the same thoughts as you. They just decided to live with it and try to find out as much as possible, in the hope that some day, we would all know more about what we are and why. Perhaps you should join that adventure? :)	0
I do not believe that Psychology is a valid science. CMV I'm of the opinion that Psychology is not a valid science because it cannot observe or test empirical data. I believe that all forms of Psychology that study the external effects of the internal operation of the *mind* are very literally only guesses based on precedent guessing, cannot be verified absolutely, and are most likely opinions formed of the observer's textbook prejudices. I also believe that observations made based on mechanical and chemical differences in the *brain* fall under the valid studies of Neuroscience, and are often used wrongly to justify Psychology. I feel that the field does not advance as sciences do, and that while Clinical, Experimental, and Academic Psychology are the most egregious offenders, all observations are at the complete mercy of the subject's ability or desire to respond truthfully. Since it may be relevant to the discussion, I am also extremely skeptical of Psychiatry, as it too is somewhat at the mercy of truth. Full disclosure: This is a mod-approved throwaway post for the following reason directly from the original approval message; as such, I'm happy to answer any personal questions relevant to my view: &gt;The reason I believe this to be the best course of action is that there are people close to me with various Psychology degrees, one of whom has very recently earned their bachelors degree... and I'd like to be able to see things as they do; I already know full well by now that I can't have that discussion with any them without leaving them feeling completely insulted by me. As my primary account is not a secret among them, I'd rather ask with some degree of anonymity. **View Update:** I do now understand that my view shouldn't be that Psychology is a non-science, but I do still hold the view that Behavioral Psychology and Psychotherapy, specifically client-therapist interactions, are rubbish. Despite that, I do strongly feel that my horizons have been expanded greatly as pertaining to Psychology in general.	0
"&gt;Psychology is not a valid science because it cannot observe or test empirical data. I disagree. Good psychology only observes and tests empirical data. I think what you may have a problem with are the theorized mechanisms behind those observations and data. Every scientific discipline that studies things about which little is known must rely on some degree of theoretical speculation. But those speculations are always based on the best data available and are amenable to change as new data is obtained. There are plenty of phenomena in physics, astronomy, biology, chemistry, etc that have not been directly observed but have been inferred because the rest of the evidence we have collected points very strongly toward a certain conclusion. Psychology is no different. The object of study of psychology might be complex in a unique way but by no means is it impossible to study. By repeatedly observing human behavior under very specific and constrained conditions, psychologists can narrow down the potential factors underlying a given behavior, often with great precision. Granted, at the end of the day, we call these theoretical psychological constructs things like motivation, self-esteem, depression, personality, and so on and it seems like you might have a problem with that. There is no ""thing"" in the human body or brain that corresponds directly to one's self-esteem and I can see how some people might be skeptical of trusting such a concept. But in a laboratory, and often in real life, experimenters can manipulate this thing we call self-esteem and predict the results with surprising accuracy based on the body of knowledge that psychological scientists have collected. You can take issue with the identification of psychological constructs and theoretical speculation in the field of psychology, many psychologists certainly do as well. But I really don't think you can say that psychology is not a valid science because it can't observe or test empirical data. Good psychologists do nothing but empirical observation. As with all science, it's the interpretation of the results or empirical observation that gets tricky. And especially so when studying something as complex as human cognition and behavior."	0
Psychology uses the scientific method to try to understand the human mind, therefore it is a science. It's as simple as that. Of course there have been many many wild, unfounded, speculative theories in the history of psychology, not to mention many failed attempts at finding evidence to support those theories - but at no stage have theories been accepted as psychological fact *without* evidence. This is the key. Many people say that Economics is not a science because its theories are untestable - one can neither set up good experiments nor get good data by observing nature. This is certainly not the case with psychology. There have been many examples of psychological theories being proved/disproved by means of experimentation.	0
"I believe that canned techniques for self-defense won't really help someone in a real life situation. CMV. I was just watching some self-defense videos on YouTube which showed some standard techniques. For example, [here]( is one such video that explains how to escape the mount. When I see these videos, I just can't help but feel that everything they show is rehearsed and that it wouldn't work in a real life situation. [Here's]( another video I saw. In the video, the ""victim"" is on the ground and the ""attacker"" is standing. The instructor explains what a person should do in such a situation: keep your knees up, track the attacker, and kick. But if you notice, at 1:42, when the attacker goes around, it's just so rehearsed and slow! In a real situation, someone on the ground would not be able to turn as fast as a person can run on their feet. And once the attacker is close to the victim's head, he can kick/stomp. Also, the video *assumes* that the attacker will want to get close to the victim's head, but that might not always be the case. The attacker could just stay in one place and kick the victim back. And if the attacker is standing, his kicks will have a lot more power than the victim's, who is on the ground. CMV"	1
"Karate student here. We have a few types of learning, and we learn the canned moves. We learn how to perfectly execute a shuto sakotsu uchi, a downward knife hand strike. We learn how to do a perfectly formed inside middle block. We even hold separate courses on ""street self-defense"", teaching how to get out of holds and what to do in what situation. However, when it comes to Kumite, fighting, all of that goes away. No one pays attention to proper form, they just block, strike, and dodge. But does this mean that all the technical learning didn't help? Not even close. I can't touch the black belts in Kumite, even the ones that are 5 years younger than me and have far shorter arms. No one is expected to perfectly execute what they're taught, but in being taught the canned moves, they learn what the moves should look like, how they work, and what they're supposed to do, and in that they can use them more effectively, in their own way, in real combat. While I may not bring my hand all the way up and strike exactly at the collarbone with a shuto sakotsu uchi, I'll certainly instinctively form my hand into the right position, bring my hand as high as time constraints allow me to do, and then strike more effectively at the area I know my strike will be most effective. None of that will be exactly proper form, just as you'll most likely never use the exact same moves that you see in those videos. But the things you do learn do allow you to know the general move, and utilize it for your purpose when you can. Watching a couple videos will obviously not be enough to give you an adequate measure of self-defense ability. But canned techniques, when adequately practiced, can definitely help in a real life situation."	1
I'm a tennis player so I'm going to use that as an analogy. In tennis, we often times practice new techniques with slow, hand-fed balls. A coach will stand close and toss a ball easily up for us to hit. This gives the player additional time to process and understand their technique. For instance, if I were to learn a forehand from scratch I wouldn't want to go out and just start hitting it. This would leave me open to the possibility that I would do it incorrectly before the proper swing was ingrained in my head/body. I think a lot of these training videos operate on somewhat the same principle. Sure you'll probably never be attacked in *exactly* the same manner that they are demonstrating, but that's not the point. The point is that in learning some basic principles in a controlled environment you can begin to develop the skills necessary for real-life situations. The guy in the video isn't suggesting that if you just watch that video you'll be ok to go out and win any street fight, so I think you're misinterpreting the purpose.	1
I find the constant updating on Nelson Mandela's condition to be ghoulish and distasteful CMV It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion. He's in hospital, oh no it's intensive care, it's gone critical, people are praying, his condition worsens... and so on. What next? headlines about how he draws his last breath? What his expression was? It's sordid imo. Why can't people wait for him to die and then report that. Why report the minute by minute progress of the dying process. My front page is full of Mandela updates. CMV I want to believe that there is something else going on and people aren't that... grisley	1
"I find it a bit distasteful myself, but I somewhat take issue with: ""It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion."" First, I think news organizations are reporting this situation obsessively for probably two reasons. One is that they are a business, they need to pursue stories that will have a large readership. The news wasn't always conducted in this manner, but today that's what we have to deal with. Two is that people have an abiding love for Mandela. Doubtless some news editors knew him, some reporters were inspired by him, and they know their readers adore him so they feel it is their duty to keep everyone as informed as possible. Second, I think most people who read these stories are trying to come to grips with the fact that he will probably not make it through the day. He was a larger-than-life figure, and there will be billions of people mourning his passing. I've heard him described as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln combined to the South African people, and the national father. If your actual father were dying, you would certainly want to hear up-to-the-minute news on his condition. I think it is somewhat similar. Tl;dr: The news organizations know that their stories will be read, and people love Mandela."	1
&gt;It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion. No, its an event upon which the hopes of an entire nation hing. Mandela is his country's Martin Luther King Jr. Imagine that instead of the 60, the US had been segregated until 1994. Blacks, Whites, Asians, and 'Natives' were segregated in schools,beaches, and even where they lived. The mostly white government would even dictate where you would live in a city based on your race. Then imagine that one day it all changed. Imagine that one of the great black leaders who had fought against segregation for 30 years was president! Mix the election of Obama with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ONE DAY. The 1994 election meant that Apartheid was ended, and there was a black president. You think African Americans were excited over Obama? This is nothing compared to the election of Mandela. So the fact that he is dying is a pretty big deal. For South Africa, they don't want a morbid update on the deterioration of a political leader. They are holding vigil for a man who represents the greatest moment in their history.	0
I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV In specific I attend a university where all students pay athletic fees in exchange for the use of school gym facilities. While I already think that this should be changed to an opt in/out system I am more interested in hearing reasons why women's only hours are defensible. This renders particular pieces of equiptment totally unavailable to male students (as they are only present in specific gyms) for hours during prime times throughout he day. So if one is paying equal fees to all other students why is one not allowed equal access and how is this a good thing? Doesn't it simply perpetuate sexism? EDIT: I appologize for the sentence where I use the term I. I am female and have taken advantage of these hours in the past I merely meant it to be sort of illustrative but it ended up being very unclear. EDIT2: Hey all this post generated a ton of great discussion and showed me a lot of ways that my view lacked nuance. My view has definitely undergone some substantial change and I'll work on awarding delta's to those arguments. Thanks all!	1
I used to work at an aquatic center that had women's only hours once a week during which only female lifeguards would cover the pool. As it was explained to me, the primary purpose of these hours was to give Muslim and Orthodox women a place to swim without violating their religion. It was common for non-religious women to swim during these times because they felt more comfortable not having to swim in front of men. I don't know what the rationale is at your gym. I would argue that yes, the women's only hours there may be sexist, but they also allow women to partake in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited to them during normal hours.	1
While I agree that this is not ideal (and I don't use the women only area at my gym at all), there are several good reasons that I can see for doing this. One is a public health tactic. Women are much less likely than men to get sufficient exercise. Exercise is an important protective behaviour for good health. The presence of men in the gym is a barrier for some women for exercising. So having some times where women can exercise without men present is likely to lead to improved health outcomes. Another is to provide a space for women whose cultural/religious beliefs mean that they can't effectively exercise in the gym with men present (imagine working out in hijab). In multi-cultural societies, this has a place.	1
I think it's economically and socially irresponsible to have children right now. Please CMV. First I want to explain *why* I need this view changed: I like children, a lot. So does my live-in boyfriend and soon to be fiance, and we've been discussing having them a few years down the line. We're financially responsible, and net in about 30K a year together. No food stamps, just simple living, etc. This would be an adventure we'd take in our late twenties, and we're only early/mid twenties now. The problem is, when I look at the future, I am absolutely terrified for any future kids of mine. I certainly can't afford a degree for them, I can barely afford one for ME. I find our public school system lacking and the job market lacking any more. Connections were the only thing that got me this job, I don't think blindly fishing works anymore. I'm very happy about the advancement of medicine, antibiotics, hospital care. I know my child will be healthy... but happy? I'm not sure. Racism, classism and other bigotries still run rampant. Violence is everywhere, I can't walk around at night comfortably without packing heat. We're both white, so I suppose I shouldn't worry about the racism bit, but what if I have a gay or lesbian child? What if they're mentally ill? What if they're smaller and weaker? I feel like I can't protect them. This may seem strange but I am sincerely already scared for a child I don't yet have... But I would love children and so would my boyfriend. Please give me some hope, or tell me what I can do to stop problems before they start. Note: I live in the Pacific Northwest, U.S. Biggest concerns: * horrific job market * even worse public school system * inability to pay for college * archaic society EDIT: Just realized I should probably add this. I'm going to work now, but I'll be back online in about eight hours or so to answer replies.	1
"Some economists and CEOs (such as Steve Jobs, I believe) talk about ""spending through a recession"", where you keep hiring and developing even as the market plunges, so that when the market recovers you are in a far stronger position than competitors who cut back on staff and research. And it's like that for the human race as well, because you now have an opportunity to raise a child in an environment where they'll learn values of spending money wisely, the use of restraint, perspective, and humility. IE: we could really use a generation that can compensate for the the ""spoiled brat"" era of Tiger Moms, Helicopter Parents, and Little Emperors. You may feel that our society is archaic and bigoted, but gay marriage and black presidents were inconceivable only one generation ago. And you may feel that the public school system is terrible, but we also have things like [Kahn Academy]( and [Open Courseware]( which were also unheard of a decade ago. The economy will get better, but it may be hampered if there's a void in the demographics by the time we get there."	0
Most people hate the public school system, but are very happy with their own local schools. It turns out that if you omit schools with high poverty rates, our schools are actually doing pretty well. That said, if you are ideologically opposed to the public school system, you are free to opt out. Every state in the U.S. allows homeschooling, although the requirements vary for each. People are beginning to predict that the higher education bubble will burst due to the skyrocketing college tuition rates and the explosion of free open courseware available, and that it's very possible that by the time your children are college-aged, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a college education may be largely obsolete. Progress is slow in our society, but it is getting better. The high school that my parents went to was not desegregated until their senior year. Now, any children that you ever have will never know what it's like to live in a world where only straight white men can be president of the U.S. I've watched many people in my parents' generation change their views on interracial marriage as their children and their friends' children married those of other races. The tide is turning the other way toward acceptance of homosexuality as well. Look at the worldwide outrage directed at Russia recently.	1
I believe that passing your genes to the next generation is important. CMV I've had my view since I learned about evolution. Now I'm question its validity. It started with [this]( I think started a [thread]( on /r/childfree but no one came up with a reason good enough to change my view, then again, I don't think they were trying so it's up to you guys. I just find it very hard to believe that someone doesn't want to pass on their genes, I mean, it's what all our ancestors have lived for, it's what all animals live for, heck, some spiders let the female eat them just so they have better chances of passing on their genes. It's the sole purpose of our existence (in addition to any other purposes we have for ourselves). It bothers me to no end that many generations ago passing on our genes was important but now that we're more intelligent we're CHOOSING to not pass on our genes.	0
It's BECAUSE we're intelligent that we don't want to pass on our genes (or more accurately, we don't value the gene passing enough to be subjected to the responsibility and other negatives of bringing up a child.) We acknowledge that if a trend emerges where the best humans choose not to procreate then we will weaken or even die as a species, but we now have the intelligence to decide we're apathetic to the fate of our species past our own short meaningless lives. It's selfish, but that is what evolution is all about. We're just using it for another reason than survival, because we have that luxury. In short, **it is** bad for humanity to do what we are doing, but we know we are not actually gaining anything from the success of our species past our own time, so why should we suffer on a personal level to help?	0
"Animals don't have sex because they want to pass on their genes - they have sex because they want orgasms and the satisfaction of their instincts. Evolution has created these rewards as a mechanism to compel animals to reproduce in order to create a reason to pass on their genes. When I say animals, I can even include humans in that. After all, many people are ""accidents"" - children born only because their parents wanted to have sex, not because they felt a need to pass on their genes. Also, many children are born because their parents had an instinctual desire to have a child. These children were not born because their parents wanted to ensure that their genes were passed on, but because of inbuilt instinct developed by natural selection."	0
I believe that the NoFap movement is harmful to men's health, as well as their relationships with women. CMV. The health benefits of masturbation are myriad, [from reducing cancer risks to improving mental health]. The external benefits, including better sexual performance and a healthier attitude towards sex, are also myriad. I believe that the NoFap movement is destructive in the same way that any abstinence movement is: it enshrines the thing it's banning in such a way as to empower it beyond what's realistic. I believe that NoFap is no different than waiting for marriage, which is a whole different CMV, in the way it denies human beings their desire to find physical communication with others, explore their own sexualities, and understand the other sex. I believe that self-denial is dangerous, unhealthy, and unrealistic. I believe that NoFap is destructive to the way men see women as they are placing desires that would otherwise be explored through pornography in other human beings, thus elevating them to standards that they will never meet, damaging the way men interact with women. Yes, I understand that the same argument can be flipped by saying that pornography reduces women to dangerous archetypes, too, but I don't buy that argument: Vin Diesel is always a bad ass every time I see him on a screen, but I don't really think he could fuck anyone up, because I can differentiate between performance and reality. And finally, I believe that NoFap is an excuse for insecure men to blame their own sexual desires and personal inadequacies for the fact that they can't speak to women. I believe that it's creating a fake solution for a real problem, and creates much worse problems as a result. **TL;DR: The NoFap movement is destructive and counterproductive to a man trying to be confident and trying to have healthy relationships with women. CMV.** **	0
"I may be able to change your view through actions. What is the longest period that you have abstained from porn and masturbation together? I'm currently sitting at ~12 days, and my sex drive is up. I used to be mainly attracted to women in porn, but now I feel like I want to have sex with (almost) any woman. By the way, you have a misconception regarding what NoFap is about. NoFap is about abstaining from porn, not fapping. It's *porn* that messes you up, not masturbation. You were built for (occasional) physical stimulation, but you were *most certainly not* built for porn. In one porn session, you are ""having sex"" with more women than your ancestors even saw fully clothed in their entire lifetimes. We abstain from fapping as well because fapping often leads to porn because our brains have connected fapping with porn. Once the porn addiction has been eliminated, you can begin fapping again if you want to. Porn is an addiction, and an extreme one at that. So I ask you again, what is your current record for abstience from porn and masturbation together? edit: grammar and wording"	1
"I am sorry but I thought that NoFAp was for a short period of time and the purpose is clearly defeined as ""to casually participate in a NoFap week or monthly challenge as a test of self control, or if fapping (or pornography!) has become an addictive problem in your life"". I highly doubt that anybody would not be able to understand the difference between real sex and a porn video. NoFap is just a game of self-control as far as I see it, there really should no affect of NoFap on how you see women or sex."	0
"I don't believe men can be raped by women. CMV. In the sidebar it says ""for people who have an opinion on something but accept that they may be wrong or want help changing their mind"". Well, I definitely know I'm wrong and that's why I'm here. This post is going to sound terrible and I really want to apologise if I'm offending anyone. I'm trying to change my view here and if you have anything to say, please say it. Part of me knows men can be raped by women. Because you know, it's fairly obvious. If men don't give their consent and women have sex with them anyway = rape. Simple as that. But for the most part I'm just really confused. I'm having trouble coming to terms with how it's possible for women to rape men. Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? I sound like one of those legitimate rape Republicans here, but if a man is being raped by a woman, why can't he just... enjoy it? I know it's a terrible view and again I want to apologise, but does it physically hurt men to be raped by women (as in PIV sex)? Although I'm aware that it would be emotionally damaging... Back to my whole ""enjoy it"" point, if you flip it around, I'm MORE than aware that it would be absurd to say to women victims that they could've just enjoyed it. I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc. I mean I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too (they deemed it ""ridiculous""). I also remember seeing a tweet on one of those true fact accounts on Twitter. The tweet said something along the lines of a man was raped at knife point by five women (his wives? Can't really remember but it doesn't matter right now). A few of the comments were guys going ""what a way to go!"" and ""sounds good"" and just general positive comments. So I guess this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped. I was considering posting this to /r/mensrights but figured I'd come here first. I know people who think like I do are part of the problem. So CMV please. My opinion is making me uncomfortable. EDIT: Just wanted to quickly say thank you for all of the responses, it has really enlightened me :) thank you!"	1
"[From two days ago.]( I'm not calling it a repost, but you might find it a useful resource. Firstly, I want to know what you mean when you say you don't believe men can be raped by women, but that you *know* they can. I don't understand what it is you're trying to convey. Do you just want to know how it's possible? &gt;Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? Rape, as I'm sure you know, comes in many different forms. I don't want to actually detail methods that would cause pain, but I'm sure you believe that some sex can hurt if you're not careful. What do you think would happen if the person having sex with you doesn't care about you at all? They probably wouldn't give a shit how rough they are, or how abusive they are. So the answer is yes, unless you're talking about coercion, which is another can of worms. &gt;why can't he just... enjoy it? [...] I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc. Okay, I think I see the fundamental disconnect here. There's a social stigma that men just want sex, and if they fail to get it, they're not manly. It happens in every ""dude man bro spring breeeeak"" movie that comes out where at least one of the jokes is, some guy gets rejected by a girl. Wah-wah-waaaah. This also objectifies the girl, but we're talking about the part of this stigma that affects males. The point is, you may have the impression that men don't have as many inhibitions when it comes to sex as women do. (If you don't, I apologize for presuming, and please correct me in that case.) However, this isn't true. I've had enough sexual experience to know that sex can feel wonderful, dangerous, exciting, disgusting, and *wrong* in the bad way, depending on the incident. If someone were to coerce me into sex, or physically restrain and rape me, I would be traumatized. There's no question in my mind. To have control of such a basic part of yourself taken away with no purpose but for someone else's pleasure would probably break me. But you're not talking about emotional trauma. Rape usually isn't about just getting sex. It's about a desire to control another person. So usually female-on-male rape isn't predicated on PIV sex, but rather it might involve sodomy with a phallic object, physical abuse, and restraint, if you're looking for only the physical. &gt;A few of the comments were guys going ""what a way to go!"" and ""sounds good"" and just general positive comments. So I guess this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped. This is actually a trend that bothers the living shit out of me, but I'll stay civil. I'm sure you're familiar with Reddit's gross negligence for the worth of women when it comes to jokes and one-off hypothetical scenarios. It's like one of Reddit's main features, that in every thread featuring a woman, one of the comment threads will be about how the girl is hot, or a bitch, or whatever. But I'm sure if I were to take this to mean ""girls must be hot or bitches,"" you'd want to slap me. Remember how I said there's a social stigma that guys are only in it for sex? Some people measure the worth of a man by how appealing he is to women. That's why Magic Mike exists, for instance. So that means a lot of guys are insecure about their sexuality. Hence, the jokes. It's a mechanism for dealing with hearing of a man being raped. ""Why, if a woman wants to have sex with me, that means I'm a better man for her than other men! How can being raped by a woman be so horrible? Doesn't that just mean she wants me really bad?"" They just can't understand what it's like because *they don't have to deal with the fear of that happening*. Sex is a goal for the stereotypical male, not a vice. With women, it's different. Sex is forbidden, an exotic gift only given to the one that woman has chosen. To take it unduly is a horrible thing because it's so important to her. Notice that this last point is actually completely correct -- it's just not considered as important for men, because the stereotypical man has sex with multiple people over his life, and it's not that big a deal. Basically in basic human society (and going back to before recorded history, in fact) the girl sticks with one guy, but guys get around. We live in a modern society now, where that idea does us no good and perpetuates a culture where sexism and that sex-based concept of worth can only ever be harmful. Sorry for the ramble, but I hope I've addressed some of the underlying conceptions you might have that cause you to be so conflicted. Let me know if I'm way off base."	1
"&gt; Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? I sound like one of those legitimate rape Republicans here, but if a man is being raped by a woman, why can't he just... enjoy it? I hate to sound like a jerk but um...do you actually know what rape is? Rape is any time that one person, through force or coercion, engages in sexual activity with someone that did not specifically of their own free will and of sound mind consent. Pain has nothing to do with it. Pleasure has nothing to do with it. It's not unheard of for women to experience pleasure or even orgasm from rape; why would it be any different for men? Bear in mind regardless of your mental state, sex is going to agitate certain nerves and cause certain physical reactions. Your personal feelings can affect these by causing the production of countering hormones (or prevent the production of helpful ones), but not stop those sensations entirely. &gt; I know it's a terrible view and again I want to apologise, but does it physically hurt men to be raped by women (as in PIV sex)? Again, rape has little or nothing to do with physical damage. Also, keep in mind not all rape of men by women would have to be vaginal sex. Oral (either giving or receiving) or anal rape (pegging) are also possible. so there is potential for physical damage even if that mattered. &gt; I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc. I mean I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too (they deemed it ""ridiculous""). Welcome to the segment I like to call: Our Society is a Bunch of Fucktards. First off, not all guys are always obsessed with sex. Do we enjoy it? Of course. Do we want more? Who doesn't want more of an enjoyable thing? That's human nature! Women are that way too, but thanks to what I'm about to discuss they are more circumspect about it. So, on to why society sucks: Men are told to be a man, they have to be virile. And that means having as much sex as you can. on the other side, women are told they have to be demure, and ladylike, and not sleep with as many people as possible. Thanks to those two stereotypes, men feel like they *have* to think about sex constantly, and women act like they aren't allowed to think about it! Thankfully those stereotypes are fading, but it will take time before they are gone for good. &gt; So I guess this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped. I have a huge appetite for food. I can pretty much always eat. That doesn't mean i want you randomly cramming my face full of a sandwich I don't like and didn't ask for, does it? Even assuming the whole ""All men always want sex all the time (horribly untrue), it doesn't mean I want sex with that specific person. And to an extent yes, people that share your views ARE a part of the problem. Thanks to views like that (no offense), men who are raped are far less likely than a woman to report it (and let me assure you the vast majority of female rapes go unreported, so that says something)."	1
While I agree with vegetarianism, I still eat meat because I don't think it will make a difference to the meat industry whether or not one person eats meat. CMV I think the way animals are treated here is absolutely detestable. I think as humans who have access to a vegetarian or vegan diet, we have a responsibility to not slaughter animals for meat. It's just that, I don't feel like whether or not I eat meat matters to companies that slaughter animals. My problem isn't with eating meat, it's with funding slaughterhouses. For instance, when I'm at a restaurant that serves meat with a vegetarian friend, they order a salad. The money they spent still goes to a company that funds slaughterhouses, right? They don't separate vegan and carnivore money. Unless you exclusively shop at vegetarian/vegan stores for food or grow your own food, you're giving money to a company that pays slaughterhouses to kill animals. Why should I be a vegetarian then? (Please please please convince me I'm wrong)	1
As one in a similar situation morally I feel similarly, though my concerns are purely hedonistic! I love me some bacon. For your economic concerns i can try to change your view! Essentially when you go to a restaurant and order a salad, the restaurant may not notice, but you have made a decision eith your money. If you do that more (or more people do it) the average amount of meat the restaurant buys will drop (probably minutely, but over time the price of meat will go up because demand is going down). The same goes for the supermarket. If you buy meat, then the supermarket will continue to buy meet in the same quantity. If you do not, then while the effect might be small, it's small in the right direction and will push the quantity of meat demanded down! So while your individual impact is small, it can be small in the right direction or the wrong direction. I've decided to simply do the better thing, not the best thing, and eat less meat :p i just have such a strong taste for it that until eating vegetarian is a more affordable and *easy* solution, I wont be giving it up altogether!	1
"Your reasoning is faulty because the food industry is just as profit driven as any other industry that means that they will produce whatever we as consumers will buy. If we eat less meat and more vegitarian then eventually the demand for vegitarian alternatives will cause the food industry to focus more on vegitarian food and less on industrialised meat production. And eventhough the restaurant you go to won't stop buying meat because your friend ordered a sallad it will change it's menu if they see a change in what people order and if enough restaurants change their menus then the food industry will change their production. No one person can change the world all we can do is change ourselves and hope that others follow. Where I come from things are already changing we have more vegitarian restaurants now than we had 10 years ago, we have an active debate about meat consumption, schools introduced vegitarian options and now some public schools are introducing meat free mondays. I try to think like this: If you refuse to change why should anyone else? Or as someone more eloquent than me once put it: &gt;""You must be the change you want to see in the world"""	1
I believe that The United States has no right to claim that it's the greatest country in the world. CMV I believe that this countries very foundation was based on violating human rights (western expansion and manifest destiny) and we continue to do so to this very day. I believe there was small window during WW2 where we were all united and prosperous but since that time has passed we've begun degenerating as a country and I fear that Americans pigheadedness and constant 'murrica circlejerk is going to blind us to the very real condition of our country where wall street robs the little man blind and a tiny majority of the populous controls a vast majority of the wealth. The average duration of unemployment in this country is at an all time high of 39 weeks, while 5.5 million Americans are unemployed and NOT receiving any benefits. Low income jobs account for 41% of all jobs in the US and a good majority of manufacturing jobs are being shipped away to foreign countries. Our education system is abysmal, tuition for higher education is going no where but up, driving many students deep into debt that they fear might never get payed off, delaying the big life events such as marriage, children and owning a home. In primary education, our country is ranked 25th in Math performance, 21st in Science, and 15th overall. This is among just a fraction of issues we face as Americans, to say that we're the greatest country on earth is arrogant and ignorant. CMV.	0
"Here's a good copypasta devised by my good friend /u/hivemind6 All you're doing is regurgitating the Reddit narrative talking points. You're misinformed and obsessed with bashing the US to the point that your view of the US is HILARIOUSLY unrealistically negative. You criticize the US and exaggerate negatives in the US to avoid acknowledging the problems that exist in other countries including your own. Doesn't have universal healthcare Yet the majority of people are insured and satisfied with their healthcare, which is superior to what exists in Europe in areas like cancer treatment. And by the way, our healthcare system is responsible for 78% of all biotechnology research in the world. Your healthcare would be worse off if we didn't have our current system, because advancements made in the US benefit the whole world. has shockingly bad public transport Due to high car ownership rates. most cities suffer from sprawl Who cares? is politically terrifying Is politically demonized, usually by countries who want to divert attention from their own problems. and has a history of awful international actions and responsibility for the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not more. As do many countries which I'm sure you'd never criticize. Meanwhile, the US also has a history of being responsible for the defense and freedom of several countries. Saving the world from Fascism, containing Communism, providing more humanitarian aid than any other country in history, contributing more to the world in terms of science and technology than almost every other modern country combined, leading the world in every field of academia etc.. 1 The US is the most technologically advanced nation on earth: 2 The US has very high quality of life and scores 4th in the Human Development Index. This is remarkable considering our demographics We have the largest diaspora from the third world (mostly Mexico) and yet still manage to perform extremely well as a country: 3 Americans are the most generous people in the world, giving over twice as much of their income to charity as the next most generous nation. 4 Americans have the highest rate of secondary education completion out of developed countries: 5 The US has the highest education attainment out of any major industrialized nation. Americans are more likely to receive higher education than Europeans, Canadians, Australians etc... Pg 42 of this PDF: 6 The US dominates in academic performance. So not only does the US get more of its population into higher education, but the education we receive is the best in the world, and results in vastly superior academic performance in all broad subject fields when ranked among world universities. Natural Sciences and Mathematics Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences Life and Agriculture Sciences Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy Social Sciences 7 Americans are the most productive workers in the world: The US invented basically everything of importance in the last 100 years, without question. The inventors were either American or were working in the US, assisted by Americans. The airplane, the integrated circuit, the microprocessor, the personal computer, the laser beam, synthetic composites, digital music, the internet etc... We now live in the information age, which the US not only created, but still rules to this day. Basically every major IT company in the world is American. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Yahoo. Almost every major site is American. Every technology that you’re using to post on this website, which is an American website, was invented by Americans. Your computer is either a Mac or a PC, both are American-designed computer architectures. Your computer is running almost certainly either Mac OS or Windows, both American. You're using almost certainly an American browser and you're on the internet which transmits data via the TCP/IP protocol, an invention of the US military. The US sequenced the human genome. An American (Norman Borlaug) was the father of the Green Revolution, creating a wheat variety that is credited with saving a billion lives. Possibly the most important human being to ever live. The US landed a man on the moon when most countries didn't have the technology to build a vacuum cleaner. The US mapped the cosmos with the Hubble telescope and dated the universe, discovered water on the moon and Mars, surveyed the outer solar system’s planets and their moons, currently has a probe exiting our solar system, the furthest and fasted object made by humans. Currently, the US is at the forefront of every possible field. Almost every innovation of note since the end of WWII has taken place with the US at the helm. The US is an exceptional country. It's just that the current narrative about the US is singularly obsessed with tearing the US down. And the big problem is that there are people just as arrogant as Americans outside of the US who base their entire sense of pride and self-worth on comparing themselves and their country to the US. So they have a huge incentive to depict the US in the most heinously negative ways. Plus, it's just not ""cool"" to be pro-US. So even people who know the truth and are aware of how pathetic the anti-Americanism is are too afraid to speak up about it for fear of being ostracized. This results in people like you wallowing in ignorance. You're basically a brainwashed drone."	0
"You seem to have a somewhat misguided view of how things are going in the US. Just because a lot of politicians and media outlets like to prop up bad press for garnering political support/ratings, doesn't mean that things are really all that bad. The US ranks highly on almost any measurable scale. Also it's good to remember that the US is providing these high quality services to 300 million + people. No other country with comparable population matches the US on any of these metrics. To help put this in context, I will compare the US to other nations and then to the European Union as a whole, as it provides a better to scale match of the US. We rank 13th in the world in education [Source]( Our score was a .978. There were 6 EU nations ahead of us. However when I tallied the 29 EU states in the top 55 on the list their average was .961, considerably lower than what the US provides to a comparably sized population. We also have six of the top ten, and thirteen of the top twenty Universities in the World [Source]( Our schools are so good that people come here from all of the world to get a chance to go to an American University, as they provide an experience matched in only a few places worldwide. This isn't an aspect of a ""second-world"" country. On to quality of life where the US again ranks 13th. There are 9 EU countries ahead of the US, and 16 behind the US (in the top 50). The US score on the QoL index is 7.615 while the 25 EU nations average a 7.27. [Source]( On an economic front its even better for the US. The US of course the largest economy in the world by almost a factor of 2. However the EU as a whole does have a larger economy. The US GDP is $15.6 trillion while the EU as a whole is $16.5 trillion [Source]( (you can also check the wiki for it but the link format won't work here). However per capita is a different story. The US per capita GDP is $49,222 while the GDP per capita in the EU is $33,101. Take into account the overall higher tax rates in the EU they also have much less disposable income than the average American. You may say, but lolitsreality per-capita GDP is scewed towards the wealthy. Us average Americans are doing much worse than they are. You are right, so lets look at the median incomes (so there is the same number of people above and below this number not a numerical average). The US is second in the world in median income with $31,111. Only beat by Luxembourg. So while the mean income is indeed higher than the median, the US fares very well in median income as well. [Source]( In conclusion things aren't that bad here, in fact this is still one of the best places if not the best place in the world to live. Are there some EU countries that measure better than the US as a whole? Sure, but there would be some states with comparable populations that scored higher than the US as a whole as well. Keeping things in perspective is key, its not just the scores, numbers, and quality of what the US provides. Its the scale, as such widespread prosperity is truly unique to us. I copied this from a previous post I made in the same type of thread, but it still applies here."	0
"I believe that Batman always wins the ""who would win in a fight"" game if he can escape the first fight. CMV. Batman wins any fight in which he can escape the first battle, be it Marvel, DC, a dance-off with Freddie Mercury, whatever. I base this on a few things: -Bruce Wayne has the funds and resources of an entire corporation, so in a pinch he can spend his way to finding a weakness like Lex Luthor. (I mean, what other superhero can spend millions on kryptonite arrows _just in case Superman goes berserk_?) -He's a _freaking ninja_ with unparalleled training. If he gets into a fight or test of manual dexterity he can just study and learn the moveset of whatever needs done. (This is how he out-dances Freddie Mercury, obviously. -He's a master detective. As soon as he gets back to the batcave he'd be analyzing tape and info from the first fight. Spiderman's got webs? Okay. Make a web-dissolving serum. -The dude trains against a wide variety of villains all the time. The psychotic Joker, the cerebral Riddler, the raw power of Bane, the shifting form of Clayface... you name it, Batman's got experience scrapping against it. In short: Batman beats up everybody. Light-hearted willingness to CMV here. Wow me with your comic book prowess. **edit:** /u/ajfirecracker knocked this one out of the park, not to mention filling my mind with the horrific downfall of Batman to Cthulhu. Goddamn. Cthulhu would probably even let him go _on purpose_, just to watch Batman go insane trying to research an answer."	0
The OP is actually much more clever than you all are giving her credit for OP has only made a comment about what happens IF Batman can escape the first fight - so any crazy-powerful superbeing wins but is not relevant to the discussion. What we really need is some sort of Lovecraftian villain that would allow Batman to escape the first fight, but which would nevertheless gradually take over and *become* insurmountable (maybe zombies, in general, although tbh I don't know if they count) That, or somebody who reincarnates as a more powerful being (Phoenix?) or who could just outlast Batman (Hulk / Wolverine, maybe)	0
"Parallel and alternate universes are common in comics. If Batman fought an alternate universe Batman, either one would eventually lose or the fight would exist in a perpetual stalemate (in which case, neither wins and thus disproves the CMV statement). It seems plausible the ""main"" one might lose at some point, since some alternate Batmans seem to differ only ideologically and not necessarily in capability, like for example [Justice Lord Batman,]("	0
"I believe Microsoft Visual Studio 1998 runs rings around any current open source development environment. CMV. I've been a Visual Studio .NET developer for 6 years after been a C++ developer for a similar time. MS Visual Studio is by far the best development environment I've used. Recently I brought into the open source ""I-only-use-a-text-editor"" development hype: I tried javascript, node, ruby on rails, clojure. edit: to clarify, I'm not talking about Java here - I've never used it, and I think it is vilified as much as VS. It's like going back 20 years. ..Well, at least 15 - at least we had debug, edit, and continue back then. Chrome dev tools are only catching up 15 years later! Most people are still using dev tools and a separate editor, 1990 style! I think all these new languages are hype and most of you don't even know what intelli-sense is. Just Kidding - I do like these open source languages - but why are they better? CMV."	1
"The biggest issue is that you're challenging your years of knowledge and experience with a small amount of time with the ""opposing view"". If I went from my vim/tmux/rake/ruby/rails/command-line work into VS, I'm sure I would find myself very uncomfortable very quickly. In fact, I know I will because when I did some iOS work in XCode and some Android work in Eclipse, I was very uncomfortable. So, remember that you're not just comparing environments, you're comparing your well-worn, broken-in shoes with a brand new pair from a new manufacturer -- shit ain't just gonna sit right on the first try. Now, that said, the majority of the time I'm doing work on apps, I don't need or use the debugger -- not that I don't have one, but it doesn't come up much. It's a (if you forgive the phrase) paradigm shift. I write my tests and I make them pass. There's not much need for a debugger until I'm plugging through someone else's code and I need to figure things out. But then I have gdb, pry, and the debugger in ruby. Also, I don't ""only"" use a text editor. I use vim as my editor, sure, but even there it's not ""just"" a text editor (though it's a damned fine editor). It's also where I run my tests fromt, it's provides syntax highlighting and code formatting (gg=G to indent and format the whole file is nice), it provides autocomplete, it provides jumping to method and variable definitions. It provides workspace management. It provides automation. I also use tmux, which puts a console into the same terminal as vim (among other things) And coupled with vim, I hit t and it dispatch.vim pops up a split where my tests run. The results are parsed into a nice, usable format that I can automatically jump to the files and lines where the failures are. If I have to quit the terminal, I can jump back to exactly how my terminal was the second I had to quit. I can pair program with someone literally anywhere that internet access exists, completely seamlessly -- they don't even need anything installed on their system past an SSH client. The only way I can justify the ""going back 20 years"" statement is that you think terminals themselves are old. Personally, I think IDEs are garbled, slow messes, so I guess we both have our prejudices. :)"	1
The open-source development environment is called ***Linux***. You have: - gcc: One of the best optimizing compilers in the world for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, Ada, and Go, - Others: Industry-standard interpreters for Perl, Python, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang, and craptons of other stuff - vim, emacs: Extremely powerful, syntax-highlighted, macro-driven, customizable text editors with tens of thousands of modules, plugins, and guides and support for code tags, call trees, regular expressions, etc. etc. - gdb: A powerful debugger with deep support for analysis - grpof: A comprehensive general profiler with dozens of utilities to analyze the results - valgrind: A leading memory analysis framework with tools for categorizing memory issues, race conditions, stack corruption, and lots more - make: scriptable build system with completely open support for user commands, variables, conditionals, pattern substution, and so forth - autotools: utilities for automatically generating inputs for make AND for tailoring it to the system in question - grep: search through directories of text files and get results with line number and context - svn, git, mercurial, etc.: support for any reasonable version control That's just from the *command line*, and most of that stuff doesn't require installing anything. And this is *before you pay for anything*. I've been using vim for a few years (not that long by guru standards) and I'm easily 3-4x more productive in it than in a more traditional IDE-style editor. With ctags and similar tools I can use it to jump to a definition of any variable, function, or class, view a call tree or an object browser, or fold in sections of code that are in my way. If you've only used the relatively dumb editors in (even the latest versions of) Visual Studio, you have *absolutely no idea* how much more powerful a strong editor is. Yes, there's a learning curve, but for something that you're going to be doing every day for the rest of your life, it's not prohibitive. For other tasks, the standard (GNU) Linux command line has evolved over the course of twenty years to be one of the best text-processing tools in the world, due largely to the piping paradigm, the wide variety of text processing tools standard in the shell, and the ease and integration of things like Perl scripts. I manage a large C systems code base and it would be much, much harder without the tools Linux affords (and I have a lot of development experience in both MS and Linux environments). We'd be *years* behind.	1
"People who won't admit to their racism are the worst kind of racists. CMV I think one of the worst and most insidious types of racists are people who deny that something they've said or done is racist or, worse still, complain about being forced to use ""P.C."" (or, as most us know it, ""polite"") language. Not only are they showing an aggressive aversion to ever bettering themselves or acknowledging any unconscious racial prejudices and hatred they might have, they actually do more to normalize racist rhetoric and discrimination that people who freely admit to their racism or the ""dog-whistle"" crowd who don't complain about black people, just ""Welfare queens"" and ""urban violence"" Everyone knows what that means and they aren't getting away with anything. I mean the people who act like talking about racism is somehow more racist than whatever racist statement of theirs they're being asked to talk about. They are the worst. As in, actual worst, and perhaps the greatest threat to the integrity and cohesion of a multiethnic society imaginable. I don't believe in criminalizing speech, but we need to accept as a society that that shit is over the line. This type of racism tends to be *very* popular on Reddit, so I really look forward to some exciting responses! (while keeping it civil, of course) In particular, I'd like to hear anyone who's objected when they were told something they said or did was racist explain why it wasn't/at least wasn't egregious or was in good fun. ETA: People who talk about living in a ""post-racial"" society are basically part of this group, if that helps clarify what I'm talking about. The best example I can think of is someone saying that a Chinese food delivery ""take too wrong"" or that a particular neighborhood or building that's not actually run down is ""ghetto"" because it's mostly black and then getting angry when they're told that's a super racist thing to do. EDIT 2: Some very angry person provided me with a way better definition, so I'm going to add that: &gt;Your ""best example"" isn't an example at all, making fun of somebody's accent has absolutely nothing to do with their race. It's the same if you make up Chinese names, it's got fuck all to do with their race and isn't even remotely racist. But let me guess, me pointing out a basic fact that you do not understand, makes me a racist that doesn't admit it, right? Yeah, bro, it does! Talking about people like that here."	0
"I believe that racism is fundamentally a product of ignorance. I'm gonna borrow /u/nope_nic_tesla example from here: &gt;I think OP is talking about people who might say something like, ""Black people are savages. Look at their rate of violence compared to white people. This isn't racist, it's just a fact. We need to carefully deconstruct this hypothetical. The hypothetical fact here is rates of violence in black populated areas is higher than white populated areas. The actual racism occurs when someone goes from that fact to the *conclusion* that ""black people are [*inherently*]"" savages because they are ignorant of all the external forces in between. Racism is not a simple thing. It is complex and easily conflated with all sorts of other things. The fundamental point that combats racism is that there are no inherent superiorities or inferiorities due to race and that any admittedly factual discrepancies in rates of violence or what have you are *not* inherent and are actually due to external factors like socio-economic forces. &gt;People who talk about living in a ""post-racial"" society are basically part of this group. People who conceive of a post-racial society are not wrong at the level of their idealism. When I think post-racial I think a society that does not hold any beliefs that race inherently creates superiority or inferiority. This is not a racist ideal to hold fundamentally, but it does leave room for ignorance and mistaken logic. The problem is when someone assumes that the ideal has already been reached when it has not, because then they are blind to *actual* racism and might end up committing racism. So are people who believe the world is post-racial or point to factual discrepancies between race are not *wholly* ignorant. What they are ignorant of in the former case is that the world is not yet free of racism, and in the latter case that factual discrepancies that are *correlated* with race are not *caused* by race. So are people who are ignorant in aspects of their view *worse* racists than people who are *wholly* ignorant of the fact that race should not be held as an inherent aspect of causation? I don't know that they are worse, they are just mistaken/ignorant in different ways. I think that there is a sliding scale of ignorance that parallels the sliding scale scale of racism, and it can be hard to determine where a specific view or particular person falls on these scales. You can not be ignorant of some things, but be ignorant of other and still be ""racist"", but there are also racists who are even *more* ignorant that still have a lot of learning and empathy to experience before they cross the threshold of racist beliefs. Some ability for rational thought is better than no ability for rational thought upon which to fight racist cognitive structures. I totally see your point of view though, but hopefully some of this helps change your view!"	0
"It almost sounds like you wish the word racism ended all arguments. The fact is that people will disagree over what constitutes racism in some cases, and when they're called out for being racist, will naturally defend themselves and deny being racist. Do you honestly expect people to just stop what they're doing whenever they hear the word ""racist""? It's much more helpful to have a conversation about why you think it's racist (which admittedly can be hard, because people get defensive about it) than to just cry racism and walk away. Case in point: someone in this thread disagreed that making fun of accents was racist, and you just called him out and said ""this is what I'm talking about right here, guys"" without explaining why it's racist. And I think the argument could be made, but you seem more interested in shaming the guy. This is what I really dislike about much far-left discourse: whoever is objecting to something is automatically in the right. But it doesn't work like that. It *is* possible to take offense too easily, and some accusations of racism *are* ridiculous. I've seen people accused of racism for simply bringing up what race someone was, in a context in which the person's race was relevant. Should people never deny being racist, even in cases like that? If there is any disagreement over what's racist--which is only natural--people who defend themselves will inevitably commit the infraction you dislike so strongly."	1
I believe that both parents need to consent to having a child for one to receive child support from the other - CMV My view applies to countries with freely accessible healthcare, and if pregnancy prevention methods can be used by both partners. For those who do not wish to have children, there are plenty of contraception options available for both the man and the woman. In the unlikely scenario that these methods fail to do their job and an unwanted pregnancy does occur, there is always the option for the woman to have a safe abortion. In the case that the woman or the man doesn't want to have the child, is it fair that one of them should have to bear the burden of an unwanted kid? We should not prioritise someone's personal or religious beliefs if they go against what is scientifically proven and the welfare of others. During pregnancy, only the mother has control over something that is to become the responsibility of both her and the father. Shouldn't the father have some degree of control over wether he wishes to take on that responsibility?	0
"The current setup is a second-best solution. Best: Society provides resources to all kids who need them Second-best: Society uses some stop-gap measure to get resources to kids who need them. Worst: Kids don't get needed resources. You're right that, in a reasonable world, we wouldn't use child-support laws to get resources to children. Those laws have all kinds of flaws, from problems of consent, to the absurd idea that a child's right to support depends on the wealth of its parents. But, the problem with the ""Remove Child Support"" position is that it's taking steps in the wrong order. If we take away the stop-gap measure, we move into the worst-case. No one wants starving kids. And the unfairness of ""Random Kid Starves"" is worse than the unfairness of ""random person loses X% of their income."" Instead, I think your position should be, ""As a society we don't want kids to starve. So, we should start replacing the child-support system with a society-based system. That way, only people who want to be a kids guardian will be the guardians."""	0
"This reeks of 'Men's Rights' bullshit, yes there are PLENTY of flaws in the legal system that more often than not benefit women, but there's PLENTY of flaws in the 'society system' that more often than not benefit men. Bottom line is, nature provided us with sex purely to make babies, there's no such thing as a 100% contraception method. Don't have sex if you aren't prepared for the IDEA of having a child. You already contented to having child by having sex, that's what sex is for. We as humans have separated ""Sex"" and ""Sex to have children"", but in natures eye's it's all the same."	0
I believe that the band Nickelback gets far too much unwarranted hate. CMV. I'm not a huge Nickelback fan in anyway, but I do listen to a few of their singles (Rock Star, Lullaby) regularly. They are a solid group; they have won several Junos and have held up as a band for almost 2 decades - people are listening to their music and enjoying it. But as soon as I go on the internet, I am overcome by tons of people making fun of them, disliking their content on Youtube, and posting cancerous memes of various band members on sites like this and 9gag. Unless I'm missing something crucial in the band's history, like hate mongering or a history of white supremacy advocation, I see no reason for people to jump on a bandwagon and hate this band. Not only that but people make extremely untasteful remarks about Chad Kroeger's recent marriage to Avril Lavigne. Avril in no way deserves any of the criticism associated with Nickelback - it has only come to light because of their marriage.	1
"I don't hate nickleback, as I think it's sort of silly to hate something that you can pretty easily ignore if you choose to. I *hate* genocide, gang violence, school shootings, and neo-nazis. I *don't care for* Nickleback. That said, I think Nickelback represents a change in the music industry, and while they were neither solely responsible or even the worst example, they were one of the first, most successful, and (perhaps most importantly) longest-living bands to come out of the late 90s / early 2000s mainstream music industry. Up until and somewhat through the 90s, there was a balance between artistic integrity and selling records. Obviously some people only cared about art, and some people only cared about money, but there was a balance struck between both of these things that was kept for most of the 'big acts' you heard on the radio. In many cases bands would put out one or two records under strict label control with ""hitmaker"" producers, and then once they proved themselves, they would be free to explore their artistic whims and put out really great records. But even the early, ""reigned in"" records were often times still produced with a balance in mind. Look at Nirvana: Their major label debut, ""Nevermind"", was terribly overproduced by the standards at the time, but it still had a bit of artistic legitimacy to it. And then they put out ""Incesticide"" which didn't win them any friends at their label, followed by ""In Utero"", which was a really good balance of art and business sense. At some point, though, the major labels stopped caring about maintaining a balance and started only caring about efficiency in moving units. The ""rock music"" they were pushing was replaced with manufactured pop music produced over blandly written, contrived guitars designed to sound harder than traditionally pop but still be universally accessible. That's where Nickelback came from. That's where Creed came from. That's where basically every ""new"" band to emerge onto mainstream rock radio after the year 1996 or so came from. But like I said before, Nickelback was one of the first, most successful, and longest lived of the ""new school"" of mainstream radio rock. Because of this, their name has sort of become synonymous with all of these manufactured pop bands masquerading as rock and designed solely to move records as of late. I think it's inappropriate to hate them or make personal remarks about them, I mean, they're just some dudes doing a job, but I can understand why people would have a strong distaste for their band as an artistic entity."	0
"From what I've heard, the internet hate comes from the sole truth that they sound just like any other alternative/pop/rock group you hear on the radio. In other words, they're not particularly unique, and there is little complexity behind their music. While this itself doesn't spark hate, the overwhelming popularity of such a simple band that sounds virtually the same as many other bands in the genre just tends to anger a lot of people. Personally, I don't hate Nickelback. I can tolerate their music, it's not god-awful...but it's just irritating how they get more attention than bands in the genre that are far superior . This seems to be how it started. Of course, the trendy ""it's cool to hate Nickleback"" just fans the flames. (I posted this in another subreddit some time ago)"	1
I believe there is nothing wrong with urinating in public. CMV. I believe that laws banning urinating in public are based on 19th century moral values, and discriminate against those with small bladders. I live in London, and I've often had to stagger home from a night out for over an hour on the tube. Even if I empty my bladder before I leave, it's entirely likely that I'll need to go again before I reach my final stop. Unfortunately, there's often no choice when caught short on public transport, or waiting for a bus late at night, so I'll have to have a piss on a tree, or in a drain, or a dark corner somewhere. However, I know that if a policeman caught me, I could face an £80 on-the-spot fine. Now, I'll concede that urine doesn't smell particularly nice, but that shouldn't be a problem if public urinators take a little time to pee on soil down a manhole or whatever. Urine is perfectly sterile, and poses no health risk. Furthermore, I would argue that complaints about having to look at someone weeing (and possibly catching sight of their genitalia) are as immature and repressive as opposing public breastfeeding. And also, would you rather I took a leak on a tree, or that I pissed my pants on the train? Ladies and gentlemen, please change my view.	1
doktatogun made some very good points against it from a medical point of view. Considering that, you surely understand the laws. Of course you peeing in public is not gonna hurt anybody, but when everybody starts doing it, it's a different story. Great analogy here would be Egypt where it is prohibited to take sand as a souvenir. Sounds ridiculous at first but considering the masses of tourists they have it's quite understandable. However, just passing a law like that is like telling people like you (and me, I know your problems only too well) to go fuck themselves. Thus whilst passing this law is acceptable there has to be some kind of 'alternative' to be provided, I think. Take Amsterdam for example: they have public 'urine walls' with a little privacy fence of the height of your head. Great solution in my opinion (not really applicable for women, though). Call your representative and tell him about these?	0
"Urinating in public can mean doing it in the middle of times square or doing it behind a bush off of a road with low traffic. If i'm sitting on the beach, enjoying the view with my family, I by no means want to see anybody relieving themselves where they will. Understand this, though. If i'm at the beach and I notice you urinating behind a rock or something that provides adequate coverage, I won't bat an eye and I will carry on with my day. Society is not comfortable with nudity. That is why pornography is frowned upon (mostly) and why there are specific beaches in only certain countries that you can go while nude. Parents think that it is some horrendous, scarring thing if their children sees a penis or nipple, so those children grow up having the same opinion. I think the solution to this problem is to redefine the definition of ""public urination"". Urinating in a bush with noone around? You're fine. You stop on the sidewalk and relieve yourself? You get a ticket."	0
I don't think breakfast is all that important, or necessary. CMV For many years, I've regularly skipped breakfast. It's sort of an established habit by now, I picked it up in school when I would be in a rush in the mornings, and it's gradually evolved to the point where I regularly skip breakfast, often skip lunch, and just eat a slightly larger dinner, or a separate dinner and supper. During Ramadan, when people fast until sundown? I do that almost every day, with no apparent ill effects. I know this is supposed to be unhealthy, but I don't have any concrete reasons as to *why*. People label breakfast as the most important meal of the day, but I don't know why. Over time, it's become something of a hindrance to me. It's just such a hassle in the morning to try and throw together some sort of food when I'm trying to get ready for the day. For a long time, I'd simply forget to eat, I wouldn't feel hungry until later in the day. I know this is supposed to be bad for me, and I'd really appreciate it if someone could provide me with some concrete reasons as to *why,* so I can convince myself that it's important to eat normally.	1
There are a number of reasons that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. 1. Eating first thing in the morning stabilizes blood sugar levels, which regulate appetite and energy. 1. Breakfast is thought to play an important role in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 1. Breakfast can be a good source of vitamins. A simple meal of processed cereals can provide vitamins and minerals which people can find it difficult to get elsewhere with just two meals a day. Now, this doesn't mean that a breakfast of pancakes and bacon every day is going to be healthy, but there are a ton of easy recipes that you can make to get your day started off well. * A whole grain bagel with cream cheese * A bowl of whole grain cereal with milk or yogurt and a side of fruit * A bowl of oatmeal (I like quaker oats, you just put oats and milk in a bowl and microwave for 2 minutes, add a bit of cinnamon) * A fruit smoothie or breakfast smoothie ( If you're in a time crunch you could just have a protein shake or an apple or something easy like that. It's all about getting in the habit, just takes a week or two of being disciplined before it starts to feel natural.	0
Breakfast is important because it is the first meal you eat after sleeping for considerable amount of time. During this time, you are fasting, and there is no need for your body to metabolise food. However, if you fail to eat when you wake up, your body gets into the habit of needing to conserve your energy for even longer than the 8 or so hours. This means your metabolism slows down, and if you eat the same amount of food as someone else that spreads it out throughout the day, you are far more likely to put on weight, as your body tries to conserve every portion of food you have, as it cant work out when it will next get a feed. Another drawback of this slowed metabolism is that as energy is needed to be conserved, this energy can't be used to think at work/school, or just generally be energetic about your day. Of course, everyone is different and you seem to have a pretty decent metabolism if you are still at a healthy weight etc. Just keep in mind that eating breakfast may increase your ability to concentrate, even if you think you are doing ok right now (:	0
I don't think smoke breaks should be allowed at work, CMV I am a smoker myself, but I never smoke on the clock. Hell, I don't even bring my cigarettes to work. I don't think it's fair that people who don't smoke have to work while people who do smoke (an addiction brought on by themselves) get to leave work for the 5 minutes it takes to go smoke a cigarette a few times during their shift. Three of co-workers take smoke breaks at least 4 or 5 times during a shift and I continue to work. I can't really take a break myself because I don't really have a reason to take a short break (because I don't bring my cigs to work). Smoke breaks have been a very common thing amongst most of the jobs I've had. So I figured there might be a good legitimate reason behind it, so I'd like to have a discussion about it. CMV. EDIT: [This reply]( changed my view. If someone feels the need to smoke, they'll get frustrated when they don't smoke and become less productive. To keep them productive and happy workers, they'll let them smoke to keep everything going smoothly.	0
"It is smarter from a business manager's stand-point to keep employees happy while maintaining work output. The path of least resistance to achieve this, when dealing with smokers at least, is to let them have their smoke breaks and keep them in ""working condition"". Since you have shown that you don't need a smoke break, it wouldn't make any sense from that stand-point to let you take a break for no reason. You don't ""need"" one. I realize that does't sound fair, but look at it from the manager's perspective. We have worker A and B in a door hinge factory. They both work at the same pace, making the same amount of door hinges per hour. Worker A smokes; Worker B does not. Worker A gets irritable and is less motivated to work if he doesn't get his nicotine. So, the manager lets him/her take their smoke break so they can keep up efficiency. Even though there is a difference between Worker A and Worker B because B will make more hinges because they continue to work instead of smoking, that difference would be even greater if A was unhappy and couldn't get their smoke break, leading to even less door hinges because they weren't motivated. With regards to Worker B, why give them a break if they haven't expressed a need for one? Ain't broke don't fix it. And at the end of the day, it is probably easiest to give Worker A their smoke break so we have don't have to listen to them be a little bitch about their nicotine habit."	0
"As long as EVERYONE or no one is allowed the chance to take a break. I'm a non smoker and have worked for a company who only let smokers take breaks. I can get just as frustrated and angry as they can and yet I'm not allowed to go and do something to cool off for a few minutes? I've worked with smokers who don't smoke at work at all and you would never know. Some bring ""the patch"" or other means to help them get through the day. In the end it's not right to allow one to take it but not the other, no matter the reason. If someone is allowed to take a break and just don't, then that's on them."	1
"Homophobes deserve the same respect as anyone else CMV To start off with, I support gay people as well as gay marriage. I really don't see the appeal of hooking up with the same sex, but I don't see why I should get in the way of those who do. Gay people are still people, and to treat someone like crap just because they aren't like you is just a down-right dirty thing to do. Homophobes are people too. I don't agree with what they do or what they believe in, but how does treating them like crap make me any better? I think homophobes are flawed, no doubt, but I think it best to look past a persons flaws and accept the good in them. I really don't understand this witch hunt people have going on. If you respond to a difference in opinion with a backlash of hate and rage, what benefit does that have? Why would a person want to listen to somebody who treats them badly? Whenever somebody lashes out at me, I feel no need to listen to what they have to say. On the other hand, if you prove yourself to be a good friend, they just must be willing to hear what you have to say. It's almost like leading by example. I mean, they might think ""Wow, even though this guy didn't agree with me, he still treated me nice and was a good friend. Maybe just because I don't like the idea of being gay, doesn't mean gay people are bad"". And maybe they don't come around. You can still have a friend with which you can agree to disagree. That's still better than making enemies."	0
"I don't necessarily disagree with you, as I believe everyone should be respected, but here is the argument I think makes the most sense with regards to why it may be ok (in the minds of many) to respect homophobes less than other people: Homophobes are not respectful of everyone. Since homophobes are not respectful of everyone simply for being human, many people consider them fair game to disrespect. Esseintially they forfeit their right to be respected by disrespecting others. I think this argument is a little hypocritical, at least how I phrased it, but it isn't entirely irrational. I am an American, and we tend to value freedom, but you quite simply can't have every freedom out there. You cannot allow all people to be free to have jobs and live where they like while also allowing perfect freedom to discriminate on the part of employers and landlords. Therefore the United States has been (slowly) siding more and more with limiting the freedoms that limit other freedoms. This is not the exact same thing but it is similar. Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't. The part that doesn't convince me is that it assumes that respect is some limited thing that cannot be given out to everyone (as opposed to freedom which clearly can't), whereas I believe that it is possible to respect people who have radically different beliefs than I do. That being said, I do not respect all people equally. I have a fair amount of respect for everyone, but there are definitely some people who I respect more than others and some I hold in slightly lower regard. This is often a factor of a nubmer of things about a person. I value traits like kindness, loyalty, leadership, a good work ethic, creativity, intelligence, and open-mindedness, to name a few. When someone is pretty bad at some of these things I tend to respect them a little less than someone who displays them quite well. Homophobes are terribly closed-minded. I honestly find it impossible to respect a homophobe as much as another person who is equally respectable in every other way. It is definitely a knock against them. I try my best not to belittle them and to treat them with human decency (hold the door open, smile and be polite, be friendly, etc.), but only because I do that to everyone. I do not respect them enough to take most of their opinions seriously, at least on the topic of society and laws. With regards to the ""witch-hunt"" I am actually not very bothered by it. I strongly believe that gay people should have equal rights, and a large and growing number of people agree with me. There are still many people who don't but it is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to be open about it, which I see as a good thing. The message being sent is that it is not ok to be homophobic. Maybe it is not being sent in the nicest of ways as it tells homophobes that their beliefs are not ok (which is always hard to hear and tends to make people defensive as you noted) but it is an important message to send and I would rather it happen poorly than not at all."	1
"I fail to see the logic or even perspective of this argument. Everyone is allowed their opinion. What matters is how people *act* on that opinion. Group A both vocalizes and takes action to prevent Group B's rights - rights which affect Group A *in no way whatsoever*. When people tell Group A to shut the hell up and leave Group B alone to live their own lives, you call this a ""witch hunt""? What do you call it when Group A vocalizes hatred toward and tries to limit the rights of Group B? I would really like someone to explain the ""Don't discriminate against my discrimination!"" line of thinking to me some time in some way that doesn't sound like nothing but absolute crazy-person babble."	0
"There should be limits on how much money a family can lose to a Casino within a certain time-period. CMV A Casino just opened up near me, and it is HUGE! There are over 3,000 slots, 150+ tables, and tons of other games / VIP rooms; encompassing 260 acres. It's basically a Mega-Mall or adult Disney Land, and people are being drawn to it like flies to a light-bub. The worst part is that it is located in front of a major shopping center where thousands of locals do their daily shopping &amp; errands. It blows my mind when I think of how many families will be destroyed because the mother or father found an easy way to forfeit their incomes to gambling, alcohol, and expensive steaks. I have known half a dozen people, one of which personally, whose families were destroyed by gambling. By having Vegas styled Casinos in the middle of a suburb and in front of our shopping mall, our community will suffer. The negative effects that gambling has on middle / lower class communities is extremely detrimental to their financial &amp; social stability; especially with how it stagnates their climb up the socioeconomic ladder. My argument is that: we should define or enforce limits on how much a single family can potentially lose to a Casino within a certain amount of time. I understand how difficult it would be to legislate this, and it may be better to use more subtle approaches; but I seriously believe that a compromise could be reached. The simplest way would be to disallow excessive losses based on whether or not you have claimed dependents on your taxes. **Pros:** * Much of the ""high"" that addicts experience comes from the anticipation of their next win. It is the constant need for that gratification which drives their over-spending. As with drug addiction, when you delay the gratification along extended periods of time; addicts start finding better ways to focus their energy and attention. Of course, some will translate that desire to other addictions, but most realize that: ""I'm doing just fine without it."" * ~~I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp; money.~~ MVC. * The first step to conquering addiction is to admit that there is a problem. Casinos do the EXACT opposite, though, as they mask the reality with free booze and the constant lure of wealth. By at least recognizing the problem at the source, I believe more attention will be brought to the issues. Even if it's just as ineffective as the ""Smoking Causes Cancer"" labels on cigarettes, it's still better than nothing. **Cons:** * By regulating the Casinos, you encourage the establishment of illegal operations. These are more damaging to a community. * Extremely difficult to legislate, and Casinos would fight it to the death; no matter what the compromise was. * There may be other more effective ways to combat the problems associated with Casino culture, and this one would be controversial. [Here is a calculator]( which shows the average expected losses per/hour. Who knows how accurate this is, but we do know that Casinos are very profitable. TL;DR: If someone has children, the amount of money they can lose while gambling should be limited. So as not to feed the socio-economic reality where 'the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer'."	1
"If you're going to follow that logic through you wind up restricting so many things that you might as well argue for universal state run orphanages. How would you even track this? Fingerprinting at the pull of every slot machine. I'd also like to point out that you don't know any families destroyed by gambling. You know families destroyed by family members. Here is a compromise play. Have some kind legal system set up where it is actually really easy to initiate proceedings to have someone declared unfit to handle their finances and a guardianship is initiated. Things like detrimental gambling habit and alcoholism would be the kind of thing that one would have to prove for a loved one. Once that is done make it so that that guardian can have that person put on a ""no play"" list on file at the casino. &gt;I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp; money. It is quite dangerous to advocate wielding the violence of the state just because activities among adults pisses you off and you think they could do better things with their time and money. Much better to devise a system where the percentage with some sort of addiction disorder can be locked out of the activity and taken care of."	0
Gambling is an addiction. If a parent has an addiction to gambling, limiting their access isn't going to change the reality of their disease. It would be along the same logic of limiting the amount an alcoholic can drink; an alcoholic has a disease and 'limiting' won't change their desire to drink. Those with addiction will find a way to do these things, regardless of the amount of 'restrictions' you put in place.	0
