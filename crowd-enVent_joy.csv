456	another parent at school wrongly accused my child of saying/doing something that he didn't do. This was not the first time, in fact it had gone on for about two years and this time was the final straw. It was time for me to stick up for my child and put a stop to it once and for all. My child was a target i guess, we had concerns over autism/adhd and this parent really took advantage of that. On this occasion, it was a Friday afternoon and the teacher asked to speak with me, so in i went. I knew it was serious as the Deputy head was also there. They explained that my child (year 3) had told a reception kid that his grandad was going to bring a gun to school (now bear in mind that this parent also knows that we (my husband) has a shotgun licence) and that her child was scared. This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic. This is where i knew that this was not right as my child headset was broken and he was unable to talk to people unless he sent a message! The ... rose up inside me. This parent lives right next to the school and when i left i was so ... that i went to confront and started banging on the door (not like me at all). She wasn't in and in hindsight it was probably a good thing she wasn't in! I was so ... that afternoon that i really dont know what i would have done if she answered as ... had just consumed me. I went home and spoke with my child and he completely denied the allegations and i believed him. I was seething all weekend and by the Monday she contacted me and asked if we could sort things out. Long story short, she admitted that it was a case of he said, she said, Ben said and that she had not hear the words come out of his mouth. This was 6 years ago and still to this day i can not forgive all that she put my child through.	0

I was visiting my younger sister who was working overseas and we had a brilliant time together. She took lots of photos of us, had them developed (it was the 1990s!) and sent them to my family. In one picture in particular, all I could see were these awful braces. I couldn't see anything else - the fabulous place we were in, the gorgeous outfits we were wearing, how lovely our hair was as we'd treated ourselves to getting blowdries, and I wrote her the most horrible letter saying that the only reason she'd sent that photo was to prove how gorgeous she was compared to me, she knew how ugly I was and that I was sorry I'd ever visited her in the first place. To this day I still feel so awful for writing that letter. She could only see the fun time we were having - I was the one with the complex about my teeth.	0

That indicates that the recipient does not have an iPhone, or that they are in an area without internet and therefore are getting the messages sent as text messages rather than iMessage. The problem was that he had not been responding and I started wondering if he was seeing my texts at all - then I had a suspicion he had blocked me this entire time. I messaged a mutual friend to ask if he had told them he was angry with me, and I then checked to see if I could still see his profile on social media platforms. I could not. I started getting anxious at the indication that he had blocked me on everything, and that anxiety skyrocketed with each profile I wasn't seeing. My friend told me she could still access his profiles, and it was then I realized he had blocked me on everything.	0

I had been working very hard to improve (making at least 250 handles by this point). Everyone in the room heard and everyone was as astonished as I was! I has so ... and so proud at the same time.
